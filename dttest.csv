"Two days ago, Christopher Nolan released his newest addition to his batting average. This is a man who started with Memento, allegedly raised funds for Batman Begins by touring and taking that movie on tour, cleansed his comic-palate with Prestige, swung hard again with The Dark Knight, and now brings us Inception. It doesn't take long to notice a heavy-hitter with that kind of consistency in making great movies, and so when a completely original idea roots into our minds _ shared dreaming _ I trust him with pruning and nurturing that idea to completion. This is the new Memento/Prestige.If you haven't seen the movie, go see it at a theatre with dang good speakers. Few movies these days persuade me to spend the $14.50 _ $18.00 it takes to get my wife and I out to the show. This one did. What follows is a low-shelf literary analysis of the entire flick, so I'm assuming if you continue to read, you have watched the movie in its entirety, and are okay with reading intimate details about the plot. I'm not responsible for spoiling the ending, so consider yourself warned!http://literating.wordpress.com/2010/07/18/inception-nolans-inferno/",1
"Anybody else wondering what was up with the snow trooper stuff? I understand it's purpose for the story, but why? Why take an interesting engaging story and transform it into an action movie for the last 40 minutes. So many things they could have done with CGI in those final minutes. I wanted to be amazed but instead they went with trip ropes on skis and gun fights. Really??? By the time I yawned through these scenes there was little time left to really build tension for the end and I forgot that I cared. I wish they would have focuses on Leo's character and explored the ""limbo"" more. This is my least favorite Nolan movie and the sad thing is it's very good on many levels. Too bad they took the easy way out instead of coming up with an imaginative way to end this. I have to believe Nolan can dream up something better than stormtroopers on skis.",1
"The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. Shawshank Redemption was my favorite movie when I first saw it, and I only realized its weakness later, this movie will look a lot worst the second time you watch it with its mysteries revealed and questions fully answered because one of the great qualities of this movie is its impossibility to guess which direction the story will take until it reaches the end. However, the movie celebrates the determination of the human spirit ""There's something inside you that they can't get to, that they can't touch. It's yours.",1
One of the best movies that everyone should see it.,1
"well...you normally don't find these types of movie all the time. In Shawshank you can see Tim Robbins at his best when compared to other movies...goes hand in hand with the plot...nd totally suits the Character to be resembled in the movie.Well this must be the best of Morgan Freeman..and as the movie reaches its climax it makes one more curious. As the movie moves towards its ending it thickens more involving one into it. Perfect plot , awesome Direction. The movie includes all it needs to show about prison life like violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars.Final ending is not at all predictable which forms a shocking climax.The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting, exciting and cathartic.This movie would always stay on the Top in my List.",1
"Well, not always, but THIS prison is awesome. I've been to real prison in Ireland and England and spent a few months in jail in southern France. Not long terms, mind you but enough to get a good first hand understanding of what life is like behind bars. If I had to be locked up for 20 years I don't think I'd mind being in Shawshank. You make lifelong friends, get a little beatdown action with the guards, drink some tasty cold brews on the roof with your buds, build a library, listen to Italian opera and go to movies with the guys, dig holes for escaping. It's the schit. Shawshank fukken rocks bro. This is possibly the best film I've ever seen. I hope if I ever go back to prison (and chances are good) I hope it's exactly like Shawshank, only I'd want to have some chicks so it would be like a co-ed prison. Maybe a chick warden too. Mmmm. Yummy wild ass prison bictches. Haha bro. I'm actually looking forward to my next incarceration.",1
This movie is fantastic. The cast was amazing and heath alone would make this film an 8/10. Cinematography and action had improved greatly from Batman begins. Just watch it.,1
"Just a awesome movie. Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks...",1
"Nolan has done it again. This is a roller coaster of a movie, but a roller coaster you last rode possibly when you saw Memento, but this is a million times more breath taking than that last one. That last one was for the most part camera works and cinematic deception. This is an extremely complex maze, that gets built in your mind layer by layer as you sit through this movie. If you try to understand everything in this movie while watching it, you are guaranteed to feel tired at the end of it, spent for the day. Do not treat this is as a date movie, no matter how big a genius you are. Be warned, for you will not get laid the night you watch this for the first time. No amount of head work in your life could have possibly prepared you for this journey. This movie is awesome to the power of infinity.Everything is awesome, I cannot use any language to explain the greatness of the director so I will not attempt, but acting, special effects all that fit with each other like Lego blocks. I believe Leonardo helps a great deal in Nolan achieving his goals, but every single actor and their performance is top notch. In an extremely complex and extra-ordinary setting, Nolan with the help of his pawns the actors and the special effects, manages to drive a strong plot. It is too much greatness anyone ever attempted to put in a single movie and managing to do so successfully is no mean feat. I won't wait for Nolan's next movie. I will watch Inception again and again.(I saw the IMAX version)",1
"I went into this movie expecting one of the best movies of all time. However, that is not what I saw. The runtime is extremely long and I found myself checking the time several times throughout the film. It was an interesting film to see, but it definitely does not belong on a list with the likes of ""Shawshank"" or ""Godfather"". The story was very confusing.There seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were never really tied up. The concept of the film is very intriguing and you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about. However, the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter Island for me. I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of Teddy Daniels. Hope he isn't going to spend the rest of his career playing that same character. It was also nice to see Ellen Page in something besides Juno. She can be more than a snarky, pregnant teenager. Also, The visual effects are extremely well-done.I am not a fan of Nolan's work. The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype. It was average to me, at best. Inception, however, is much better than Memento.It is a film that you must see just because the concept is very interesting, but it is not something that you can watch over and over again.",1
"Tim Robbins is wealthy banker ""Andy Dufresne"" who finds himself sentenced to life imprisonment after his wife and her lover are found murdered. The handsome ""new fish"" is initially the target of the ""sisters"" who would use him as they would like - but he fights back and gradually establishes a friendship with prison ""scrounger"" Morgan Freeman (""Red""). When he overhears the beastly prison guard captain bemoaning some tax problems, he, rather riskily, volunteers to help find a tax-free solution and is soon advising pretty much the whole place - including ""Warden Norton"" (Bob Gunton) on all things financial - some above board, some less so. The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it's more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole. The last half hour is up there with the best cinema has ever had to offer, and this - again on a big screen - is a must see adaptation of one of Stephen King's lesser known, but better, stories that delivers a redemption never, quite, anticipated by the prison service!",1
"Simply Amazing, life-changing, and inspiring. The plot is twisted and intriguing, making it highly desirable to re-watch. By showing the numb minds of our present state, it shows how we should awake from our slumber which is fruitful. When I first watched the movie on cable TV, I was young and although my shortage of age and experience, I benefited a lot from the story-line. I was inspired even more in my ambition to become an author and thus worked harder in my efforts. The nature and setting of it is one of a kind, despite my long period of watching movies, i haven't come across one with so much thrill and zeal. So in the end I strongly recommend it to be watched and enjoyed but with meticulous attention.",1
This film stands out as arguably the best of the trilogy and I cannot agree more. Powerful performance by Ledger as The Joker.,1
"Great cast, so much fun to watch and rewatch. Trying to figure out the movie with your friends and checking out the many online theories was a great memorable experience. And it tells you how deep the movie goes, making you uncertain of what you see is somehow real... or if it was all a dream.",1
"Though not unsatisfying, in the end this latest instalment of the Batman saga fails to live up to the hype generated mostly by Heath Ledger's untimely death, and the general expectation of his delivering an epoch-making, fatal performance, the Joker being the agent of doom in the way the Requiem was for Mozart. Well, much like Mozart's Requiem, the performance is impressive, yet charged with mannerisms, and not as nuanced and masterly crafted as previous specimens of his art - Brokeback Mountain to name one. In a sense all the depth and menace of the Joker is plastered in his make-up and no acting can be much more menacing than that, a blurred manifesto of sick behaviour in which every option is simultaneously on display, a mask that would have incapacitated any actor to play with the range of fearful transitions from suavity to ferociousness that make Hopkins's Hannibal so memorable. And, as a villain, or better, as the purported incarnation of evil in its purest form - Chaos - the Joker is too evidently a monster to be really seductive and infectious, therefore there is no real interaction between him and the ""goodies"", who can only reject him entirely, even if in the war on terror they are forced to adopt draconian measures, blurring themselves the boundaries between good and evil. And here lies the major weakness of the movie: when loading a summer blockbuster based on a comic-book superhero with moral metaphors and statements on contemporary society one has to keep a balance between adult/thoughtful dialogue and its visual counterpart. Having deliberately refused to compete with other action movies on the grounds of choreographically elaborated fighting sequences, the Dark Knight needed a major dose of lethal fireworks: after all here more than anywhere else you have to see chaos at work. But this is something the morality of the director refuses to deliver: a hospital is blown but no one is injured - no carnage, no collective madness - and after the Joker disappears from the screen all excitement is gone, that is to say for the last thirty minutes. The transformation of Aaron Eckart's Harvey Dent into the promising new villain Two-Face is then totally wasted away, and he dies after having only just shot a corrupted cop and threatened to take revenge on the family of the actual culprit of many deaths; not very much for a final showdown, and quite a weak re-run of the metaphysical fight between good and evil.",1
"Even after 10 years,this movie is still unbeatable in its respective genre.Heath ledger iconic portrayal of the joker is unparalleled. There is no any other movie in which the antagonist influenced so much of the movie.Believe me,Heath just nailed his character.its an amazing story concerning about human psychology and its reactions when pressured till the breaking point.this movie will be studied in film schools.this movie is like booze,gets better with time.Mark my words,this movie is the shining kohinoor of the superhero genre, shining,flawless and unparalleled.",1
"Shawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was, and some of them (many of them) said, ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and I said, ""I haven't even seen it."" And they assigned it to me as homework. I started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in fact, seen it before.That's how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on IMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I don't? I wish I could know, but I can't except by reading their comments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don't think it's a terrible film, despite all the picking I do. I'm trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect and think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I like, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to know. Please don't read further if you just want a confirmation of why this is a great film. In brief, I don't think Shawshank probes, invents, or seduces aesthetically. It's just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the least, and a really good ""wordsmith."" His stories work with simple conflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing happens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a turn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That's pretty much the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the characters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but flimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful black man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates), and the thoughtful white man who doesn't like anyone (at first), played by Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the ""twists"" are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and that was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really ""realistic"" in any sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there, from rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as a ""fable"" it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final happy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it would naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently interesting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar clichés, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on purpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and enjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and warm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to fastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second time seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn't seen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual (those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because it's obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let's tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was leisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it's drawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, ""movie music"" pure and simple, in its lush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it directly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or ""bad"" especially, but that's hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But really, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those now famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of the movie doesn't crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die Hard have more inventiveness. Isn't Shawshank presenting Hallmark sentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No faulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some great filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some good night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few moments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the escape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed ""nicely"" so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be caressed and not assaulted--it's not an action adventure film, so I don't expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable. Oh, I'm sure Frank Darabont doesn't mind the cult status of his movie, but he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of a lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all had to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more originality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the Shawshank we have. It's not a shame, obviously, that we have what we have, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn't care for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so again, it's just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that there are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn't go the places I need a great movie to go. It's not a bad movie, not at all. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much more than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me as flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child's lie. It is content to be superficial, and I, personally, am not.",1
"I don't normally comment on films on this site, but when I saw that this movie was rated by users as the #1 movie of all-time, I had to set the record straight.Yes, while this is a good movie with great cinematography and a great performance by the late Heath Ledger, it is far from being the #1 movie of all-time. It is not even the #1 movie of the summer (Iron Man, for one, was better). Nor is it the best movie in the series (Batman Begins is better). There are plot holes galore and the chemistry between Maggie Gyllenhall's character and Batman/Wayne and Dent is simply lacking.Those who rate this movie #1 all-time clearly have not seen Raging Bull, Clockwork Orange, Rear Window, Casablanca or any number of other all-time great films. This movie should not even be in the top 200 all-time.Good...but not the ""masterpiece"" other users suggest it is.",1
"What do our minds tell us when we see something we don't want to see? We wish they were dreams, just made up images caused by chemicals in our brains. Dreams are extremely powerful, and this was displayed in Inception with great force. It shows what can happen and what can't happen with our thoughts; things we want to see, things we don't want to see, and things we have to see. They also conjure up our imagination more than anything in our lives can force to do. We create our own little worlds and certain things happen in those worlds. All of this is pretty much explained in the film and it keeps your interest extremely well. All of the situations and different places and things that happened throughout the movie really showed how powerful dreams and our imaginations are. The performances didn't par up with the great story telling and production value but they were still great nonetheless. I highly recommend this movie to anyone to wants to think deep and to be taken into another world for 2 1/2 hours.",1
"According to the official studio synopsis, David Fincher's film is described: ""A ticking-time-bomb insomniac (Edward Norton) and a slippery soap salesman (Brad Pitt) channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground ""fight clubs"" forming in every town - until a sensuous and mysterious woman (Helena Bonham Carter) comes between the two men and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion."" Meatloaf again. As you'll discover, the film's official synopsis isn't even remotely correct; but, it's a good way to ""sell"" ""Fight Club"". This film is violent and *pornographic* - this is a WARNING - but, except for Jared Leto's silly putty face make-up, the cast cleans up well. The beatings are brutal, but help make the film's point, and are a part of the protagonist's madness. ""Fight Club"" is a comedy about the lead character's rejection of society's domestication of his life. Or, it could be about something else...To Be a Man.The film received an ""Academy Award"" nomination for the ""Sound Effects"" by Richard Hymns and Ren Klyce (beaten by the first ""Matrix"" and the latest ""Star Wars""). ""Fight Club"" is excellent in many ways, but isn't (and shouldn't be) as polished a ""production"" as 1999's big winner, ""American Beauty"" - a film which opened simultaneously, and presented critics with more palpable male angst. ""Supporting Actress"" Carter deserved some consideration for her memorable ""Marla""; she even sings gets in a few lines from the ""(Theme From) Valley of the Dolls"".********** Fight Club (9/10/99) David Fincher ~ Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf",1
"I didn't know how to take this movie.  I started falling asleep halfway through, then had to stop and watch the rest the next evening (on DVD).  I have to say, I thought about it all the next day, and couldn't wait to see how it ended!  The end was marvelous, and this movie was not what I expected!  I really didn't care if I ever saw it, but my wife went and rented it-- the next thing you know, I'm hooked!  Meat Loaf gets better and better- give him more stuff!  Brad was, as usual, a throwaway, but Norton was superb!  And I kinda liked scary-girl (she could have been played by anyone, like Brad).  But the one thing that really made me smile, was the deliberate mis-casting of Pitt- it lent the character more substance... I don't want to give anything away, but by casting a Hollywood ""heavy"", it added to the effect!  (If you saw it, you know what I mean).See this movie. period.",1
"Pros:
Very cool, well written characters, Joker is pretty stand out, good villain and cool ideology
Acting is impressive from most of the cast, very few actors are not able to properly portray their given characters
Some very good action, especially in the tunnel
Tasteful cinematographyCons:
Hong Kong scene was boring and useless
Batman kills dogs
A touch long, Harvey's arc should've began in the previous movie perhapsBest part: Joker's incarceration, the character is still always in control even while in a prison cell
Worst part: weird CGI sonar parts, hurt my eyes",1
"This film can be either a persons favorite film, or they hate it and will hate anyone who gives it the slightest thumbs up. Whatever group that you fit into, you will at least agree that it is a movie that has created a whole new type of genre. The cast is led by the mysterious Tyler Durden (played by the always brilliant Brad Pitt), this characters back story is never fully explained. It is a physiological thriller throughout the whole film. I will tell you two watch this twice, not because of the start or the middle, but for the end. The first time you see this you will no doubt be shaking your head and saying ""What just happened?"" The second time that you sit down and watch this, you will notice a lot of little signs, giving hints to what is going to happen at the end. I would personally think that nearly everyone would simply over look these small easily missed details, but the second time around, keep a look out for them.Fight Club (the title) gives away only part of the film, but what the title does give away is the most brutal part of the film. Some of the fight scenes, without giving the movie away, are brutal. This is not a film that anyone under the age of fifteen should be watching. This is mainly because of the ending. I'm sure kids who watched it these days would laugh at the fight scenes, because they've grown up watching CGI fight scenes.I really believe that, whether you love the movie or hate it, you should definitely watch it. It is not a movie that is easily forgotten.",1
"When I was going to watch it for the first time, my friends (who had already seen it) challenged me to try to understand the movie on my first viewing. I immediately accepted the challenge. I started with a goal to accomplish what the movie meant, and largely accomplished that goal. I say largely, because the very beginning of the movie confused me and it took me a few rewinds to understand what was going on.The cast was great, the story unique. A thief who runs a racket of sneaking into people's dreams and stealing ideas and secrets is hired by a rich dude who wants the former to enter into a business rival's head. Only this time, he has to 'plant' an idea, not steal, which has never been done before. What follows next is a typical hiring process of accomplices reminiscent of heist movies like Ocean's Eleven along with complex planning and almost flawless execution.Mr. Nolan is known for his non-linear story-lines, and this one is no different. The story is relaxed, but requires too much thinking on the viewer's part to grasp what the heck is going on. If you are one of those who leave your brains back at home while watching a movie, believing to just 'go with the flow', then this movie is not for you. It requires utmost attention, grasping every dialogue.
It's like solving a math problem. You cannot reach the next step unless you understand the current one.Having said that, I would say I immensely enjoyed the movie, and it was a truly unique story-line unlike any other movie I have ever seen. As a sci-fi fan, I liked this movie a lot, and it ranks right up with the greatest movies of all time.",1
"I had to watch the Joker two times to feel i have given the movie what it deserves. I might do a third one. This is how much i liked it. When I saw people started to compare the two Jokers performances, i decided to watch the 3 batman movies. Man, heather was out of this world, and his performance is a masterpiece. He deserved every award he received. However, it is not a fair comparison between the two jokers. Each gave the role what it takes to make it a masterpiece. Seeing how crazy the joker in batman movies, then understanding how and why he got crazy from the Joker movie, they all fit together. Great job by all.",1
"Wow, when I went to see this movie I didn't know what to expect. I'd been following it since the day it was announced and was incredibly hyped up for it. Batman Begins is one of my most favourite movies of all time and I knew it'd be a huge effort to top it.Then I saw it, and this movie blew me away! It was outstanding in every aspect with no flaws. Even though it was lengthy, I was entertained every second (but personally I enjoy long movies, as long as their not boring crap. To put it bluntly? anyway). I still think Batman Begins had a slightly better storyline, this one was still amazing. Batman Begins had the upper edge, as beginning stories are easier to write. Sequels are always hard to write and normally don't surpass the original. This one did. As they focus on the building of other characters, not just rebuilding the Batman.Some might say what makes this movie is Heath Ledger's amazing performance of the Joker, which is legendary, is what makes this movie, but if you took it out ever other part is amazing.This is the kind of movie that makes you think you can have your pie and eat it as well. In fact I'm going to try that now.10/10 and rightly deserved.",1

"I'm not an English major so take this as it goes - I'm gonna try and make this quick. My favorite movie of all time is T2 and Jaws...but this film...man if I had to pick one...JUST ONE...this would be it. Sure its based off a book but goddamn is it amazing. The acting, the set design, the cinematography...EVERYTHING...literally...NOTHING is wrong with this film. The Score, the story, the pace...EVERYTHING. After my house fire I had two years ago I felt like Andy...everything taken away from him...nothing but himself and what was inside (a reference to him and Mozart remember?) ....as time went on I learned that its not the physical items in your life but what you have inside. Even though I had seen the film more times than most...a few days after the fire...and a few days of drinking and self pity(rightfully so) I was inside my hotel room and said screw it and watched the flick. Get busy livin...or get busy dying......THATS GOD DAMN RIGHT! I owe a lot to this film both before and especially after the fire. If you don't think of it as AT LEAST one of the top 5 movies of all time...you better have one good damn reason. R Smith Cape Cod, MA wink emoticon",1
"Palahniuk talks about the modern man who enslaves himself for all the wrong reasons. The story is a criticism on the consumer-driven world we are living in, about the ties in our lives which are mostly material, society, and about our dreams to one day say and do what we mean and want - it's about freedom and a way to achieve it, or at least rebel against the status quo. The movie is an introspection, and a close and cynical observation of the exterior world, where we stand in it, It's a glimpse into the reality of things. It's smart, and an eye opener.The movie itself is perhaps Fincher's best, dark, stylish and brutal. It made me want to punch certain aspects of my life in the face and in many ways changed the way I react to things. And by the way, has anyone else seen the multiple subliminal frames in which Tyler appears before he actually appears? - have you never almost seen him in your everyday life? Cause I have!",1
Great movie thats pne of my favorites and would reccommend to all,1
"A Master Piece! Nothing can be better than that. Story, Drama, Emotions, Suspense everything was there and perfectly decorated! A must watch at least Twice! The cast has been picked very carefully and the roles assigned to them have been perfectly played. The End, its incredible and pretty unpredictable. Hats off to the writer, director, actors and the entire team.",1
"I remember back in 1999, I saw a commercial for this movie on TV. Like many others, I blindly watched the commercial and somehow assumed that it was some stupid action flick that somehow got popular actors in it. "" Fight Club? What kind of stupid movie title is that?? Why would you want to hurt yourself like that"". While it did only okay in the box office, eventually it became a cult classic. I saw part of it on a Movie Channel a few years after it was released, and really liked it but I hadn't seen the whole thing. A message board I went to ranked it as the best movie of all time. I had seen it on many top 100 movies list and I hadn't realized until then how loved it was. So then I saw it again, and I was blown away.  This is now my favorite movie ever.The movie mixes genres....it's like a crazy mix of a Drama, Black Comedy, and a Thriller. And that's one of the many reasons why it's so great. The beginning of the movie shows the Unnamed Narrator ( Edward Norton) struggling through life. He is wealthy, but seems to think his life has no puprose. He works in the day, goes home, and spends all of his money on possessions and expensive things that he does not need. He is a slave. He is also cursed with insomina. Eventually, he finds freedom and hope by going to support group meetings for people with diseases. This helps him sleep and makes him go on with life like a normal person. Until Marla Singer ( Helena Bonham Carter) starts attending support group meetings, and like the Narrator, she is a faker. With another faker, the Narrator can't cry at the meetings to be happy or sleep at night. So they agree to split up there meetings. One day, he meets an odd but flamboyant fellow named Tyler Durden ( Brad Pitt) on an airplane. Tyler is everything he isn't, but in many ways is everything that he wants to be. The Narrator's condo blows up, and has no where to go, until Tyler lets him live at his delapitated house where he makes soap ( He is a soap salesmen and other jobs include a projector who splices porn into children movies and a waiter at a hotel). On one night, Tyler asks the Narrator to him..."" as hard as you can"". The Narrator finds this dumb, but they enjoy themselves and find out that fighting is the cure from society and coporate consumurism. They eventually start "" Fight Club"" together..and meet in basements of bars to free themselves.
Things are perfect for a while, until Tyler loses control and what was once a Fight Club turns into what could be compared to a terrorist organization , and it's up to the Narrator to stop it all...you will find this out when the shocking twist is revealed, as it changes the movie forever and turns it into one of the most re watchable movies ever. The second time you watch it, hidden messages and subtle references are made vivid to the viewer , and therefore, to me it's one of the best movies ever. It's brutal , funny, and touching at the same time. Fight Club is also one of the most quotable movies ever.."" Things you own...end up owning you"""" This is your life..and it's ending one minute at a time"""" Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains"""" On a long enough time scale, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero"""" Without pain, without sacrafice, we'd have nothing"""" You are the all singing, all dancing crap of the world"""" It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything""",1

"This is a movie that goes beyond a lone superhero fighting comic book villains in a fictional city. Its a brilliantly directed masterpiece that will leave you gasping and starring at the screen when the credits roll. Like the first movie Christian Bale brings his strong persona to the billionaire Bruce Wayne who uses Batman as a symbol to bring justice in Gautham.However this movie isn't just about Batman, its also centered around someone else, someone far more complicated and dark. The Joker.Nolan and the late Heath Ledger give the Joker a dimension I have never seen before in a villain. Ledger's performance is nothing short of brilliant, breathtaking and aw-inspiring; almost as if he is drawing upon the demons within himself to portray the Joker. He is the most believable villain I have ever seen on the Big Screen and he will scare you from the first time he appears in the movie. As brilliant as Christian Bale is in the movie he is over-shadowed by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Every time the Joker is on screen the movie has a feeling of its own. It moves away from being an action flick based on a comic and becomes something much more dramatic and complex. Like Batman you get lost trying to figure out the joker and reason behind his demented personality and his haunting crimes. If Heath Ledger doesn't get an Oscar for this role I don't know who will.Other supporting actors also provide strong performances. Aaron Eckhart is very good as Harvey Dent/Two face and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman as always do a great job as well. The only week link in this movie for me was Maggie Gyllenhaal, like Katey Holmes in Batman Begins she doesn't quite hit the nail on the head.Nothing I can say in this short review will give you the true idea of how good this movie is or what its is really about. Its so much more that any of the previous Batman movies. Its a perfect balance of action, drama, suspense and quite brilliant acting and direction. This movie is a must see whether you are a Batman fan or not because the chances are that by the end of it, you will be standing and applauding.",1
One of the best films of all time. No doubt. 10/10,1
"I went to see Inception in the theater, and for the second time in my life experienced the feeling of desperately wanting to get up and walk out so as to salvage at least part of the evening. Had I been sitting on the aisle I certainly would have. As it was, there was no choice but to sit through the whole excruciating thing, hoping beyond hope that it would end and put me out of my misery. I know others have rated the movie highly, and I respect their opinions. At the end of the screening I went to, many of the folks leaving seemed to have really enjoyed it. Personally, though, I think it was just awful, for three reasons: the stakes, the villains, and the writing. Comparison with The Matrix series is inevitable, because here - like in The Matrix- we have action taking place in the ""real"" world and a ""dream"" world. Inception takes the Matrix-like concept and adds to it with multiple dream worlds, and dream worlds within dream worlds. That idea has the potential to be interesting, so due credit there. The first problem, though, is that the stakes in Inception are too low. In The Matrix, success in the dream world means saving all of humanity from enslavement. OK, that's a goal I can get invested in. Here, success in the dream world means two things: a) the Leo DiCaprio character gets to see his kids, and b) one big energy corporation gets an advantage in the market over another big energy corporation. Ho hum. (Now, don't get me wrong - it's possible to make a movie where the audience gets invested in a father-child relationship, and an emotional journey comes to have high stakes. To do that, though, the movie has to work to develop the emotional elements of the characters and the story, which Inception doesn't do. There's so much sci-fi gimmickry, action, and special effects that there's no room left to develop a human story worth caring about.) Well, if it's not a success as a deep character study, at least it can be a good sci-fi action thriller, right? Well, there's more hope here, but still it didn't work for me. Here the problem is the villains. There aren't any. Yes, Our Heroes do a lot of fighting, but it's against random faceless gunmen who pop up and get shot down like in a video game. Again, compare to The Matrix: the scenes with Agent Smith talking to Morpheus, and later to Neo, give us a bad guy we can really root against, which makes the good guy more fun to root for. Or in Die Hard, when Hans Gruber kills the smarmy guy without qualm, it makes Hans more evil and makes it more cathartic when he loses at the end. There isn't even a betrayal twist where one of our favorite characters turns out to be the bad guy. Of course, the conflict here is not man-vs-man or man- vs-nature, it is man-vs-himself; but as already noted above, that takes attention to character that wasn't paid here.",1
"Its always a prodigious experience to witness a new level being set for the international cinema and Inception indubitably offers you this incessant experience.Post-Avatar phenomenon,which through its visual splendor induced the third dimension into the movie industry, Inception is set to expand the boundaries of the the fourth dimension , i.e. Intelligence.Christopher Nolan has effectively created a Non linear,time parallel, real surreal multilayer-ed plot which keeps the audience involved on an intellectual platform. His previous venture ,The Dark Knight, succeeded in transforming the comic-book figures into concrete and multilayer-ed characterizations giving the darkest shade to the Gotham city ,and his new venture ,Inception ,explores the possible potential of a human brain to create and manipulate a world within .Nolan has handled this transformation with an exceptional ease and astounding improvement proving his stance as one of the best directors international cinema has ever seen.Special credit has to be given to the editor Lee Smith who along with Nolan have brilliantly converged multiple plots running through different time slots and dimensions into a 148 minutes visual treat.The plot revolves around the character of Cobb played by Leonardo DiCaprio,who specializes in a new security which deals with the concept of stealing vital information hidden in one's subconscious memory called Extraction. Throughout his tasks he is constantly troubled by his guilt which takes the form of his dead wife Mal.The film gains momentum as Cobb who is an extractor by profession is assigned with a new task by a businessman named Saito played by Ken Watanabe to implant an idea in certain Robert Fischer, Jr. played by Cillian Murphy to create a corporate breakdown . Cobb in his pursuit gathers a team along with his point man Arthur played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He assembles a six man team comprising of an architect Ariadne played by Ellen Page,a sedating expert Yusuf played by Dileep Rao , a forger Eames played by Tom Hardy along with Cobb, Saito and Arthur themselves being present.The first half of the movie explains the concepts of creating a world in dreams and the rules by which it runs. Nolan uses astounding logic to describe this process of creating an ever expanding world by infusing paradoxes at specific points such that the projections of subconscious do not understand that they are actually set in an never ending loop. Singular ideas such as creating a passageway through nested dreams of different characters layered in an order or a totem which enables the dreamer to distinguish reality from dreams polishes the plot to shine incessantly.The second half deals with how the team executes the idea. The tempo of the movie gets an acceleration soon as the team discovers that the brain of the mark,i.e. Fisher Jr is actually trained to counter extraction. Cobb's troubled subconscious makes the situation more complicated as Ariadne discovers that Cobb is reliving his memories ( shown beautifully by Nolan through an elevator sequence) which could sabotage their entire mission. The twists in the plot thereafter and the concluding sequence will leave audience gasping for more. Special mention to Leonardo DiCaprio who portrayed the character of a troubled extractor with elegance. Following Shutter Island , Leonardo DiCaprio completes a pair of the the most intellectually challenging movies of this decade with Inception. He is complemented by good performances from the incredible cast.Hans Zimmer works his magic again with the background score for the movie and encompasses brilliant visuals through his trademark music.The movie does require utmost attention of the audience which it deserves as the movie weaves intricate subject with a good pace.The plot does contain few weak connections such as the reason for selecting Ariadne as an architect, or the reason for entering the fourth level of dream sequence.But Nolan overshadows these weak spots by illuminating them with his gift of creating master pieces . A Must Watch.",1
"The advantage that this movie has compared to the first Batman movie is that this has been made in 2008. Therefore, you can clearly use of better technology, advanced camera and special effects and terrific action sequences. But the thing that you can also see is wonderful acting, intense sequences and a good script.The movie has perfect length that a Superhero movie should be having. There is no excess of drama, not much love angle or triangle or love is any other complex shape and yeah, no gay sequences ( Remember Jim Carrey in Batman Forever?) The movie is just about perfect and does not exceed its limits by adding extra silly stuffs like Batgirl or whatsoever.Its a shame and very sad that Heath died at an early age. His scenes were the most intense and he completely stole the show. Christian Bale also delivers a good, if not excellent, performance. Just a bit of a problem with his voice as Batman. I laughed at some of his Batman scenes due to the sudden heaviness in his voice.The other actors, especially Aaron Eckhart too give memorable performances. There is sufficient amount of action and action which is unlike the one seen in Batman and Robin which was cartoonish and silly.The movie deserves all the nominations that it has received. The sound, lights etc too succeed in creating an intense chilling and atmosphere. 9 out of 10.",1
"I think the whole trilogy was perfect, the Chris Nolan's work is impeccable, if you like Batman, you will love the three movies. The storyline, the acting, the sound, the script, everything is excellent. Christian Bale did a well done as a Batman. These are the best Batman movies so far.",1
"Well, a great movie if you think that DC comics are great literature. A plot with more holes than swiss cheese, with a level of intelligence and sophistication one might expect of a junior high school student (now exactly why were the Joker's handcuffs removed?). And let's not forget the de rigeur finale in an abandoned building and the laughable pseudoscience of the cell phone triangulation nonsense. Why were most of the ""action scenes"" filmed at such close distance that there is no sense of the entire scene, just close ups of cartoon characters getting struck, maimed, killed. (Apparently depictions of sadism are now a high art form.) And what a clever ploy to replace wit and intelligence in screenplay with interspersed explosions. After all, the louder the better, right? Please, give us back Michael Keaton. What made filmmakers like Hitchcock great was not their ""boom boom"" graphic depiction of violence but rather an ability to use film to engender tension and suggest violence by subtlety and anticipation in the minds of the viewer. Judging from the general acclaim to which this film has been received here and elsewhere, apparently today's moviegoers prefer to be literally hit on the head than be fed images and ideas that might grow in the head.",1
The Dark Knight Is My Favorite Batman Movie Ever Made And By Far The Best Batman Movie Rest In Peace Heath Ledger,1
"The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.""",1
"The best movie ever made. A totally different concept which hasn't been tried till now (dream stealing) which is shown as an entertaining heist film. Brilliant performances by an excellent cast which includes Leonardo Di Caprio, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Tom Hardy, Michael Caine,Ellen Page etc. It also has an brilliant visual effects and editing. Above all this complex story is made into a interesting Sci first thriller by the masterful direction of Christopher Nolan. It is both confusing and entertaining at the same time and one need to really use his/her brains to fully understand it and might take more than one viewing. It is must watch fir every movie fan.",1
"This immediately became my favorite movie of all time the first time I watched it (before interstellar). i even remember watching the trailers (back when i used to watch trailers) and openly stating that it looks like it could be my favorite movie ever. i stupidly went into the movie with the highest expectations i've ever had. and it still completely blew me away.the experience was phenomenal, fascinating, nerve-racking, and awe-inspiring from beginning to end. elite directing, elite acting, elite cast, elite concept, elite story, elite cinematography, elite music HANS! elite everything. this movie can be analyzed for hours. it has so many layers (figuratively and literally). this movie blew my mind. it explored something fascinating in all the right ways, taken it in all the right directions (7 viewings, 5/15/2020)",1
"I have one problem with this movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She has no conviction, she is annoying, and I felt no sorrow when she died. Her failure to portray Rachel the way Katie Holmes made her in Batman Begins as wholesome and dedicated makes it hard to relate to Harvey Dent's grief. In this movie she is entirely different, seemingly only there because the plot requires it, she brings nothing to the movie. With that being said, that is one very little flaw in a fantastic movie. The sonar cell phone was a little strange, but I'll take it. I mean, Batman always has cool toys.What really makes this movie great is the way it can make you feel twisted. Ledger as the Joker is marvelous. He says that he has no plans, money is meaningless, it's all about the message. He's trying to send the message that we are all a little corrupt, we're all a little off, and we just need to be pushed. The human mind is a fragile thing. As dark as this movie is you are frequently laughing. The Joker takes a man's life with a joke, the disappearing pencil, sick and disgusting, yet everyone is laughing. Every scene with Ledger leaves you laughing and feeling as if you are the most terribly gruesome person. Why are you laughing, he's murdering people. We are corrupt. That is what he believes, and that's what he shows you. It's sick.Aside from the violence and mind twist you have the struggling hero. Or heroes. Batman fighting crime along side Harvey Dent. In the end Dent is corrupted, Batman is not. Batman is the hero that Gotham needs him to be. The greatness of this movie has little to do with Batman, but what he stands for against a world of corruption. He stands as the man who is willing to be loved or hated to see his city fight back. I will say no more, you must see this movie.It is likely that I will never love another movie more.",1

"A person as enthralled with Fight Club as myself could write several pages on how terrific this film was.  The ideas presented in this work are not just some testosterone induced fantasy - they are very real prospects presented via rather radical means.  Our world is in trouble today, and Fight Club does an astounding job of shedding light on these issues.  The acting, the dialogue, the direction, they were all fantastic.  The action was good, but it is not what made this movie what it was - the brains behind the story are what bring it up into the shining light that is good film production.  If any of you reading this are all happy about the BMW you drive, the Armani you wear, or the four story mansion you live in, see Fight Club and learn a lesson.  This movie was made for you whether you enjoy it or not.",1

"Just so you know, I do tend to like most sequels except ones like The Butterfly Effect 2 and Phenomenon 2 which was just a retelling of the first movie usually with no characters from the first one in it. Also a sequel like Blues Brothers 2000 was crap. Magic? Honostly. Wow, I'm nearly a full paragraph into my review and I haven't said anything about the Dark Knight except that it's a sequel. Well there is one thing you should know about this movie. It Freaking Rocks I'm a huge fan of comics but I mostly stay in the Marvel category because DC always seemed to outdated. Superman and Batman (the original movies) came out some 20-30 years ago and never seemed quite realistic. Studios have tried to bring these famous superheroes into the 21st century with Superman return, which was supposed to be the third in the Christopher Reeves series even thought their was little or no continuity and I had thought that Batman Begins was supposed to have been a prequel to the old Timothy Burton series (though now I've read the IMDb FAQ I now know that it wasn't which was good because I could've told you that if it was then it failed considering the original movie had it that the Joker killed Bruce's parents... I think... my memory's getting away from me... It might've been Two-Face...) And speaking of the Joker and Two-Face, that brings me to the two main villains of this film. Heath Ledger and Whatshisname (Aaron Eckhart? I'd check but that would take precious seconds away from me ranting about my new favourite movie) were ABSOLUTELY FATASTIC. I'll explain by starting with the Joker. First of all, I was a huge fan of Jack Nicklson's (I spelt that wrong) performance of the Joker in Tim Burton's classic. He was absolutely perfect choice for the Joker. But I'm going to have to say that Heath Ledger's performance completely surpasses Nicklson's. Wow. The voice that Ledger has created for his villain made my skin crawl. The way that he could make every lip smack so perfectly audible was creepy. Also, the voice was obviously the voice of a lunatic and when he was angry and shouted it made me jump ie. the video when he shouted ""LOOK AT ME!"" and also when he said ""Why... so... Serious?"". But we must remember that Ledger didn't actually come up with the dialog himself and a round of applause should go to Christopher Nolan and his brother for writing the part so well. Don't get me wrong, the first time that he explained how he got his scars my heart sank as I felt they had destroyed the mystery that had made the Joker so creepy. But when he explained how he got his scars the second and the story was completely different I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie hoping to hear a brand new story about his scars (sadly though it never came). Now comes the second villain. I'm glad the the Nolan brothers knew that people would already know that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face and gave us little nods with things like the coin flipping and the line ""You live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". The only thing that upset me is that he had to die, because he had obviously become a madman. I can't say that the performance was as legendary as the Ledger's back was fantastic nonetheless. The funny thing is that the performances of the two bad guys completely overshadow the main character Bruce Wayne/Batman. That isn't to say that Chritain Bale's performance was bad it's just that we sometimes forget that the movie is about Batman and not Commissioner Gordon, who seems to be the main good guy considering that at the end of the movie... wait, you know what. Even though I've said that there are spoilers in this review, I'm not going to give away the ending that makes this movie so much better than all other superhero movies. Watch it again if you've already seen it. Best Movie Ever. 10/10",1
"This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.",1
"This movie is simply amazing. The acting was great, the plot was outstanding, and Ledger's performance was well do I even need to say how creepy but cool it was? Batman Begins was a great movie but like what Gears of War 2 does to Gears of War 1 it makes every good thing about it even better. I loved how the Joker turns a noble man like Harvey Dent into one of Batmans toughest foes. I love how the Joker turns Batmans world upside down. How he makes Batman have to pick between being the Dark Knight and his love Rachel. I don't think this movie would be half as good without the Joker. I don't know if there will be another Batman but should they make one? I'm not sure.",1
This movie is the best Batman film yet! Heath Ledgers Joker is perfect and Christian Bale portrayed Bruce Wayne very well. The action sequences were very well done and the story was very well written. This is by far the best of the Dark Knight trilogy. I though that the Joker was a great villain and Harvey Dent was a good supporting villain. Overall an amazing blockbuster. Great follow up to Batman Begins,1
"The greatest superhero movie, and one of the greatest movies of all time.",1
"First of all, this movie is insanely brilliant, it totally lived up to the hype. ""What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea!"" I couldn't agree more! Chris Nolan once again shared his wonderful and brilliant imagination and gave something much more than a summer blockbuster, this is truly an instant classic and deserves the highest respect. First of all, I couldn't believe that thus was a ""one man project"", the man wrote, directed and shot and post produced the damn thing, all by his self...and on such a high level....simply mind blowing! The script is so well written, so original, so amusing, doesn't have any holes into it...the direction is perfect, the cast, on top with Leo Di Caprio, who is, let's face it, a ""hall of fame actor"", it totally delivers! There is never a dull moment, the 2:30 hours pass like minutes, your jaw never has the time to picks itself up, you're constantly exploited to the pure genius of film-making, scenes that will never leave your head, and keep you replaying them in your mind on the way home...There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real blast. The action scenes are well presented and done to perfection, and the music by Hans Zimmer is totally haunting. In the whole movie there's never a chance to move your eyes from the screen, cause it has so much layers, so much going on.. Do yourself a favor, don't wait to watch Nolan's perfect movie, pay the ticket and see it in the theater and have your mind blown away in style....",1
"The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times. In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something. I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.",1
Some movies can travel through time. They simply don't die. This masterpiece is for sure one of them. It's just a perfect movie. I don't know how the academy was thinking back there in 1994. The story is touching and meaningful and the acting is terrific by Robins and Freeman. I can't stop re-watching this piece of art.,1
"When you get two life sentences, maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had a hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the prison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out, he decided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart person. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So Red too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees, it got nothing in the end. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so popular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance. Without hope, without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another impressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award. If that happened, he did not have to wait 11 years to get the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10",1
"'The more I know, the more I come to know, how less I know'. After watching thousands of movies and having some hundreds with me currently. I found 'The Shawshank Redemption' now. I have been avoiding this for some time, thinking that it would be another usual prison drama stuff. But since, IMDb had top rating, nominated for 7 Oscars, and some good reviews.OMG what a movie- Amazing, how you get entangled in a web of deceit, and proving yourself innocent among those master treacherous is nothing less than impossible. Here how Hope takes charge and this proves when Morgan Freeman says at last ""Some birds are not to be caged as their feathers are just too bright"". Tim Robbins in role of Andy Dufresne is excellent in 'silent intellect on work' profile. Morgan freeman is not a surprise in ""Red"" as I have always liked his acting and not to forget his convincing voice.On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.The only other movie which I liked that far is ""Forest Gump"" and incidentally this was also released in 1994. If this doesn't say enough, set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my tie with Forest Gump.",1
"for sure this is my favourite more than 'in bruges' though the movie is not technically when you watch it now,it doesn't matter because you wont feel that you are watching a old movie .the emotion played such a big role,also 'the characters did good justice for it.i was almost in tears when that fat ass was screwed by the cop.the character brookes is stills in my eyes (the way he walked in the road when He was out of prison ,the innocence in his face when he tried to kill his friend,that made me fall in love with this movie.not even in my dreams i expected the he#ll go out of jail.and the friendship between red and him after he faces people who were gay.... ithink this movie should have been given all the seven Oscars.",1
I don't why this move top the 250 movie list .it's a good movie to watch but not that good there are better movies that truly worthy to top that list.,1
"No words would do this movie justice...And I thought Batman Begins was great! It was-don't get me wrong...but when this one came to life, I think it put all other movies-including great Batman Begins-in its small pocket...Definitely the best movie of 2008 (so far;no one knows what the future holds), and definitely among the best movies of all time...Acting was superb..Christian Bale did an amazing job as the 'dark night'...the late Heath Ledger, the Joker, simply redefined the standards by which such roles would be judged...his performance was impeccable...Its among the very few movies that will make you root for the bad gay (to a certain extent). Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were excellent, as usual, in role and character...Gary Oldman was great too as Gordon...So was Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, respectively...As I said, no words will do this movie justice...great acting aside, the plot was amazingly smart, interesting, thought-provoking, and most definitely, entertaining...A MUST WATCH to all...will keep you in awe and amazement for the entire 2 hours and 20 minutes..guaranteed! And the one request you might have after those 2 hours 20 minutes is for the dude inside the booth to rewind the tape and play the movie again! Watch it...you won't be disappointed...11/10 had that been an option :)",1
"An absolutely amazing performance by Heath Ledger, acting at its finest, has become a timeless classic.",1
"this is the great and powerful movie , but doesn't mean is #1 for me , each one have #1 movie so don't judge me . for me Godfather 1 is #1 This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.But this is a great movie , over what i said , still The Shawshank Redemption deserves 10 of 10 .",1

"I'm sure you've all seen this by now, so I'll just tell you about my favorite theme in the movie. For the astute, you will have ascertained that the alluded-to theme is pain. We've been taught that pain and fighting is just in certain cases: fighting for self-defense, for love, for ones country. So why the controversy over 'Fight Club'? Because they fight for no apparent reason. Perhaps because of boredom with life. I wonder if there is ever a situation in which pain in and of itself could be a good thing. How much can you know about yourself, how truly free are you if pain is always secretly influencing your opinions? Remember the incident with the lye? Powerful, beautiful. I wrote a piece about a similar experience of mine entitled,""The Cross.""",1
"Perfect is a word I never use when talking about films but this breaks the rule. Here are my top reasons for giving this a solid 10/10.1.) Acting. All the acting in the film is great, Aaron Eckharts troubled Harvey Dent really allows us to see how easy it is to fall into evil. Christian Bale not only gives us a good Batman but a good Bruce Wayne as well, Michael Caine is forever excellent as Alfred and Gary Oldman does really well portraying the tough Jim Gordon. However Heath Ledger is the star of the show as the Joker. He gives us an insane, disturbing character who seems very real and very, very evil. His performance is in my mind the best portrayal of character in film EVER! 2.) Story. The story is full of exciting twists and links to the comic books. There are no plot holes and the story rockets from action scene to action scene however the bits in between are still interesting and develop the characters really well.3.) Effects/Props. The effects on this film are great from the chase through Gotham to the machines and make up. The new Bat Suit is better than the already good one in Batman Begins and the final battle scene is very very well done.So overall this film although being almost 3 hours is engrossing the the last minute. Everything from the dialogue to the prosthetics to score seems to hit the target.",1
"One of the classic movie ever made. Lots of enthusiasm is shown in the movie, apart from all the suffering prisoners have to face. Must watch movie. Still capturing the box office. Shawshank is a true story and a must watch for any new member. Tim Robbins has done a fantastic job including Morgan Freeman. The Story line of the movie is really more biased then any other top bench marking movie. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",1
This movie i don't know how did i miss it. heard from no one at all.

"Well, the trailers, the reviews had my anticipation going before I watched the movie. However, the expectations were tower high as Chris Nolan is one of my favorite directors and Leo is my favorite star. I prefer never to miss his movies.Merits First : Story , Screenplay and Direction : 10/10 ,Direction was consistent in all the places, didn't feel continuity errors, Story and Screenplay were so engaging that involved the viewers at every point in the movie, challenges them and leaves them enthralled, confused , wanting for more.CGI / Special Effects : 8/10 , Got patchy in a couple of places,specially the Paris Cafe Scene.Acting : 10/10 Totally Blown away by the performances of Leo, Ellen Page , Joseph Gorden Lewitt , Tom Hardy are exceptionally good .Technicals , Cinematography , Casting : 10/10 Nolan just paints the canvas with beautiful dreams and subconsciousness of people.Background Score needs a special mention as it adds to the mood of the film.Inception is the story of Dom Cobb(Leo) and his team of ""Extractors"" , who deal with a special kind of security called subconscious security. They enter the dreams of subjects, extract their secrets from the dreams. Cobb is a fugitive of American government and corporates. He stays in Japan and want to get back to his family. A Powerful Japanese client offers him a deal to give his life back in return for his life and lift all the bans on him in return for planting an idea in his competitor's mind. Cobb decides to take a ""Leap of Faith"" and starts collecting his team for this. He meets Ariadne, a young and bright architect from his father's university , and Eames who leads him to Yusuf, a chemist with deep sleep sedatives. Together, they start working on the mission to plant the dream in Fischer Jrs Idea.No spoiler's here I will not reveal anything from suspense but on a whole the movie deserves a standing ovation as execution of such a script is a very difficult task, Nolan has handled it quite efficiently. The anti-gravity scenes were too good. The cinematography , the creation of dream worlds , the concept of architects were so good that you can believe that the time required to build the script and its depth took 10 years and the movie was pitched to the producers just after memento.",1
"When everybody said this was going to be the best movie ever made...they meant what they said. I don't think that I have EVER watched a movie that can live up to what this Batman movie has given us. Christian Bale gives another fantastic performance as Batman, Gary Oldman was spot-on as Gordon and Aaron Eckhart gave a surprisingly good performance as Harvey Dent. But I must say that in my honest opinion....Heath Ledger as The Joker STOLE every scene that he was in. I must say that he was absolutely brilliant. In the first scene where he has a major role, everybody in the theater erupted into applause when it was over..and every other time after that. The guy gave us an automatic Oscar-worthy performance. I was so pleased to see that his work turned out the way it did because of how everybody had pre-hyped it up just because of the fact that he is dead and this is his last complete performance...but it wouldn't have mattered if he was alive today, everybody that leaves there theater will be impressed with how good of a job he did. But when you take all of the amazing work The Joker did, the action was great, pacing was good, cinematography was awesome, and the actors just fit their parts really well and gave us a superb performance. Just a little warning that the movie is VERY close to 3 hours so make sure you have some free time when you go to see it!",1
In the movie The Dark Knight Harvey Dent becomes two face by getting one side of his face burnt with fire. Well the director and writer need to brush up on their details. The reason I state this is because in the movie Batman Forever when Val Kilmer was batman there was a video shown of the news coverage on a case of Harvey Dents. Well in that video it shows the criminal throwing some acid in Harveys face. That is how he became two face and how he developed his hatred for batman because he was not there in time to save him. Get the story straight. Other then this small detail I commend the director on the special effects and the storyline of the movie.,1
"This movie is simply astonishing. Must watch movie in a lifetime. The work of Morgan Freeman is the most brilliant from my views. But all The credit and magic is goes to the Amazing Director of the Movie, I also Watched his movie 'The Green Mile' Which is simply amazing like this one but still it is not interesting or emotional like the Shawshank.In the end Shawshank movie i was simply full of emotions in my life for the first time by watching a movie . Otherwise i did int think so that some Movie or Actor or Director can make me so soft hear-ted. Well For the movie, just amazing . You will not regret after watching this movie.Oh my Advice, Watch it in on the Big screen with headphones on and no disturbance at all , then you will realize how good is the Shawshank Redemption.",1
"Well where do i begin! I've been excited about seeing this film since seeing the trailer back towards the start of the year and being a big fan of the batman movies my expectations were extremely high. I went to see the film the weekend it came to cinemas and was worried it wouldn't live up to my expectations nor the hype surrounding it. But wow! i never expected it to ever be as good as it was. The story was outstanding and for a batman film actually quite complicated there were a lot of twists and turns and you never knew what was coming next. As with the acting it was phenomenal best performances being from Micheal Caine , Aaron Eckart , Garry Oldman and of course Heath Ledger who played what in my opinion was not only the best on screen villain of all time but quite possibly the best role in a film ever. This combined with some amazing memorable scenes and in parts this film is hilarious mostly delivered from Bale and Ledger and the occasional tip of the hat from freeman!. Although there was a tremendous amount of big names in here it was done brilliantly giving them all decent time in the film. And although the film ran at roughly 2 and a half hours you never wanted it to end for one second. Action fans need not worry as there are some out of this world action scenes and although this film isn't a full on action movie when the ball starts rolling it really makes up for it. I feel like no matter how much i write i could never sum up this film in full i had to see it twice! and it only got better with time. Heath has to win an Oscar for this and to be honest this film deserves a few in other areas. And watch out for the ending! wow even had people in tears throughout the cinema has got to be one of the most powerful endings ever. For me the best thing about the film was the story itself pure genius the concepts and ideas and some of the most memorable and well thought out lines and scenes ever. This film appeals in my opinion to anyone and everyone from young children all the way upto older folks and you don't necessarily have to be a big batman fan to enjoy this gem. Watch out with the kids though as this a very dark film and has scenes and ideas which may frighten younger children *****",1
"Never was a fan of superhero movies and such, I wouldn't even consider this a superhero movie. Just a masterpiece. Plainly put.Everything blends perfectly almost no flaws within the movie, Ledger and Bale do a great job at their roles and give you a taste of the true nature of their character.The epitome of all films and shall forever be used as a guideline for films to come.",1
The best movie i have ever watched. Never forget that the first kicks are important in real life as well,1
"The Dark Knight is probably one of the greatest films of all time, and is undoubtedly the greatest superhero of all time WITHOUT A DOUBT. It blows any MARVEL or other DC film miles out of the water. This is mainly due to Heath Ledger's (RIP) stellar performance as The Joker, DC's most iconic villain.Christian Bale's Batman is good, possibly a little comically voiced, and is a great counterpart to Ledger's Joker, as he embodies everything the Joker is against.Truly an exceptional achievement by both Christopher Nolan, Hans Zimmer (music) and of course Heath Ledger. This film will go down in history.",1
"I must be, like, getting old and jaded or something. I found the movie predictable and more straightforward than I hoped it would be.A good alternative name for the film would have been ""Wait, what?"" as if there was any less action you'd be constantly asking yourself why the eff they didn't do X, or why Y didn't happen etc. The word ""contrived"" will keep nudging at your brain if you're not doing an exceptional job of suspending all disbelief along with all common sense.The final scene of the film was rather obvious from early on I thought.I found it relatively easy to follow, exactly what I was expecting, and totally lacking in interesting ""Sixth Sense"" plot twists. Everything pretty much was as it was presented to be.Not sure how this makes it to #3 on the all-time best list.The Matrix was way more entertaining...G.",1
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!",1
Great story great acting The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made.,1
"Inception is an infinitely creative, original, and fascinating movie. Once again Christopher Nolan refuses to give in to usual Hollywood cliques and creates a brilliant screenplay as well as capturing it with his skilled directing. From the moment I first saw the teaser trailer for the film, I was both confused on what it was about, and excited to find out. As well as being smart, the movie is also entertaining and visually stunning in an equally brilliant way. The movie's plot is very complex from the very beginning of the film. For me, it was a bit hard to follow, the only minor complaint I have, but I payed attention because I actually wanted to know what was going on. The movie's well paced and interesting throughout. The movie is well acted, especially Leonardo Dicaprio, and Hans Zimmer's score is one of the best Iv'e heard in years. Inception is another reason Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite writers in the movie industry. It's great to see him working in the realm of science fiction.",1
"The best film I've ever watched, if you haven't watched this film, not only do I pity you, I also resent you. This movie is a masterpiece. this movie is the best. This is one of the very few films that I will call perfect,The greatest and best end of a movie in history,I consider it the best movie ever",1
"David Fincher continues his streak of great movies with Fight Club.This is perhaps his greatest cinematic achievement.A movie simply unique and unlike anything done before.Eddy Norton and Brat Pitt shine here and give amazing performances.The plot is rather strange. The narrator (Edward Norton) is an automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform product recall cost appraisals. His doctor refuses to write a prescription for his insomnia and instead suggests that he visit a support group for testicular cancer victims in order to appreciate real suffering. By attending the group, the narrator feels important and cared for and then is able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups. The narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), at the groups he goes to and his insomnia returns.During a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who is a soap salesman. The narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler and meets him at a bar. Tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. The narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar. The narrator moves in with Tyler and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the parking lot. After attracting a crowd, they establish a 'fight club' in the bar's basement. Soon, other fight clubs are established around the country, with Tyler's help. Get the picture?You have to see this masterpiece to appreciate it.A terrific movie on all levels.Fincher gives his best and gets the best from his actors.Highest admirations for creating one of the best movies ever with one of the best twists ever.",1
"For me, this movie is the best! I love the direction",1
This film looked and sounded amazing with some well brilliantly shot scenes and amazing actors. It does make you question dreams in a different way. What if you could live in a dream world or if you couldn't wake up. You have to forgive the film for alot of things ( like the fact he wasn't able to go home because they thought he killed his wife even though someone surely would have seen her in the other building. And how do you throw someone across a street when pushing them out a building?) But overall great film.,1
10/10 best movie one of the best movie i seen in my life,1
"One of the most difficult problems to solve in movie making is how to end. And I judge movies according to how the maker deals with that task, no matter how affecting the beginning and middle may be. This is where the 'Matrix' movies fell flat, for instance.Stanley Kubrick was rightly praised for many things he accomplished, and beyond the visuals, he knew how to do 'inceptions' in our minds. Could Nolan also accomplish leaving an idea or image or feeling in our (sub)consciousnesses that we can believe is ours? That lingers and builds imagination, and yes, dreams?I give this 10/10 for doing that, the same way ""2001"", or the conclusion of Nolan's Batman trilogy in ""Dark Knight Rises"" (to name but a few) did.Ask yourself, were -you- 'kicked' at the end? Did -your- totem keep spinning, or did it stop? I was on the edge of my seat waiting to face that question.",1
Mr. Louis lehot says that inception movie is one of the greatest and most watched action movie of all time,1
"Bruce Wayne has his ideals and ambitions. His primary goal was to avoid a repeat of his parents' tragedy in the people; and his ultimate goal was to bring long-term peace to Gotham and no longer need bat chivalry. The story of BB basically tells the achievement of the primary goal: the police and bandits no longer collude with each other, and people have hope in their lives. Seeing here, BB laid a solid foundation for the new Batman film series, let us relax, feel that such a happy ending, I am afraid there is nothing new to discuss in the sequel. Of course I was wrong: BB is quite realistic compared to the four older romantic Batmen, but for director Christopher Nolan, BB is still a long way from what he thinks of as Batman. Maybe he thinks Batman does exist in reality. This will be shown later.In detail, BB only discussed Batman's problem in half. It only explains the motive, but it doesn't say the cost.-of course, if you insist that previous spiritual practice and dual life are the price, then go to the Spider-Man stream of children's movies. Batman's bright attribute lies in motivation, while the dark attribute lies in cost, so Nolan hands over the responsibility of exploring costs to TDK. The proper meaning of ""Dark Knight"" is ""dark price"".Obviously, if Batman's story is put in the real world, it's far from as simple as BB. ""one hundred thousand. Once bats are hit on the ground, there is no way to fly again. Nolan would be happy to do this experiment. In order to achieve a strong sense of reality, Nolan took pictures of Gotham in TDK in the real city, and even put a branch line in Hong Kong by name. Gotam has faded its goth light, even the light rail line in BB has disappeared. In this completely realistic urban environment, if you look at it from a fully realistic point of view, Batman's existence is particularly ridiculous. We laugh at him all day long about putting his underwear on his head, so it makes more sense for him to pay the price. In this pseudo-realistic film, citizens are no longer a simple group, everyone has their own circle of interests and positions. Some people agree with Batman, some COSPL AY Batman, some curse Batman as a lynchman in defiance of the law, leaving only human flesh search for Batman. When the clown claims that Batman does not surrender and kills an innocent citizen every day, every citizen freaks out, does not curse the clown, but points the finger at Batman. When incompetent individuals encounter helpless fate, they often pass on anger to innocent third parties. Clowns are really everyone in social psychology!",1
"I remember when I first saw this when it came out. I had never heard of it, and my parents decided to drag me to it. History had shown that whenever that happened, I would not like the movie. However, when it was over, I was speechless. The story, the characters, the action, everything about it was so engaging. It really makes you feel for Leonardo DiCaprio's character, and the things has had to do just to get back home. All the supporting characters are terrific in their roles, they did a great job casting. The story itself was very hard to follow the first time around, but after watching it again, I understood almost everything. I've seen it many times since, and I continue to find things that I missed previously. If you have not seen this movie, you are really missing out. I recommend that you watch it as soon as possible.",1
"The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at entering people's minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn't care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the midway point), things fall apart.",1
"Fight Club's the most fun I've had in years. Through David Fincher's almost perfect adaption of the novel to Brad Pitt and Edward Norton's performances, Fight Club is top notch at whatever it tries to achieve. The film has those moments of mystery and sense of curiosity that will keep you at the edge of your seats until the mind blowing finale. And even after that , you might wanna watch the movie again or even thrice , because of the numerous clues hidden by Fincher in the movie. The movie is filled with thought provoking quotes and the score also does a fine job to give an overall chilled vibe. Lastly , there are some funny references to movies you've watched and let's just keep quite on that for the sake of not spoiling the fun.This could well be , the decades most wanted and most talked about film.Fight Club gets a 9/10",1
"The only serious comic movies unfortunately are 2/3 decades away (blade, spawn, etc) and nowadays most cinema movies consist of extremely overhyped superhero movies
But this one
You cannot catagorise this this movie is perfect the trilogy is perfect it's respectable
Enjoyable gripping fun this is a movie that meets realism with a genre that has no realism and NAILS it
You haven't lived if you haven't seen this movie",1
"I first saw Fight Club in a (college) freshman comp. class, while I thought it was a decent movie, my perceptions of the film was tarnished by a rather haughty (not to mention full of himself) professor. I caught it again a few months later on t.v. of course like all movies it was (butchered) so it would be ""clean"" enough for the general viewing audience. However, this time I was much more into the movie than before. I thought Marla was too out there for my taste (and she is still a bit ""out there"") I was much more engaged this time around and decided that I would rent the movie when I had time. I was able to see the unedited version a few weeks later and I loved it. Many people just see the title and dismiss it as some dumb fighting movie, but it is a statement of the feminization of the male gender. While most woman (myself included) like the idea of the ""sensitive guy"" men aren't programed that way and this film expounds on that. Some of the best parts are when stuff starts to blow up (and who doesn't like stuff blowing up? ;) ) the anger at the world is truly (and quite justly) felt. It is not just blowing up stuff, but it is a political statement of a generation's repression.",1
"Good film. I will try view this. It's retro film, which i fill good.",1
"It's been 15 years since when this film was launched. I've learned nothing but a simple lesson, ""You get busy living, or get busy dying"". We all can be busy, but which one are we? Hope is the only weapon for us to reach the state of ""get busy living"". Very great movie, and d most inspiring after all. I pray that all people who are facing the most toughest moments will have hope that God will guide to lift their state of busy dying (living in that moment) to...the wonderful Get busy Living!!It is about the lesson. Now talking about the film making; Mr. Robbins was cool, very well act his role. I don't want to discuss why he didn't get Oscar, because his partner Mr. Freeman (who got the Oscar) was doing very well too. My dad does't like drama actually, but when he saw this movie, he was moved and stand still on his chair to watch this incredible movie. If you don't believe that this movie is awesome and can inspire you to change your life, why don't you just give it a shot by borrowing or buying that movie?great thanks i deliver to Stephen King and all people who are making the story possible for me to watch. i have been changed so much.Last, just recommended for all people who are holding hope!",1
"I am new to commenting on movies, so maybe I shouldn't have started with trying to put the Shawshank Redemption into words. The themes of hope, depression, friendship, greed, and triumph connect with the best acting I have ever seen in a movie. The actors are so good, you begin to look at Morgan Freeman in real life as ""Red"" and Tim Robbins as ""Andy"". The humor is ever present, such as conversations held by the inmates. But perhaps the very best thing for an average viewer is the constant surprises. I'm not talking about monsters jumping from trees, I'm talking about how every time the movie starts to seem to get slow BAM! something happens that represents one of the themes. If you have not seen this movie, maybe because the fact that it is a ""prison movie,"" or maybe because it is now eleven years old, you have missed out on a life experience. It is my favorite movie of all time and always will be. The 9.1 rating on IMDb is so well earned and underrated.",1
"I know this is going to start some trouble,but i gotta write it.There is a tactic used in movies that does get on my nerves,but i don't get bent over it because i know that's how society can be.(Not how it always is.)What movie makers do in order to keep the audience with the story and not become upset with the death of a character,is make said character a black person.The fact of the matter is that most of the viewing public is white,and nothing is more upsetting than a white person biting it.This is not always the case,many,many movies off plenty of white people,i know.Most of the time it is within the context of the story-horror,serial killer,etc.-but during some movies it is used,and it does work.Before you fly off the handle and post some juvenile hate-filled rant my way,do some research for yourself.That being said,i loved this movie-see it in Imax please-but i was disappointed to see this tactic used so often in it.The joker killed about four black people,which didn't bother me too much,but i don't see why they couldn't have mixed it up a little.",1
"In this new film directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Dark Knight), Leonardo Di Caprio stars as Dom Cobb, a skilled thief in a world where people can steal secrets from other people's subconscious by entering their dreams by using a machine_this process is called ""extraction."" Cobb, an international fugitive for being a master of ""extraction,"" is offered a chance to get his life back if he does one last job for a company, where instead of stealing ideas, he is sent to plant an idea_this process is called ""inception."" Working with a team of extractors to infiltrate a corporate boss's heir, Dom finds this process difficult, as he has to deal with own personal dark memories as well.When I first heard Christopher Nolan was directing a new, original movie, I was very excited. He directed Memento, starring Guy Pierce, one of my favorite and the most mind-boggling cerebral thrillers ever made. He also made that good ol' film called Dark Knight, which broke box office records. His films, often written with his brother, Jonathon Nolan, tend to be multi-layered, challenging, and many times, thought-provoking. He is also a great, visual stylist, as can be seen in the movie. Having seen the movie, and given that this is one of the films where Christopher Nolan wrote without his brother, I think it could've helped with an extra edit to clear up and tighten things up.This film is a visual spectacle, and the special effects are nothing short of breathtaking. Buildings fold on each other like Dark City, characters are tumbling and jumping off walls, and stairs sometimes go on forever not unlike something from M.C. Escher. Many things go on in this film. The fuzziness of reality and memory recalls writings of Phillip K. Dick. There are lots of action scenes. The plot gets convoluted. I felt a slight numbness in my brain keeping track of everything in this movie, as many things are happening simultaneously.One of my favorite parts in the film, and an important subplot, was when Cobb's memory of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), interferes with his job during a dream sequence, where we get to know more about Cobb's psychology and his darker secrets. Leonardo Di Caprio gives his usual best as the mentally complex Cobb. Marion Corillard is memorable as the figment of his memory of his wife. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is in physical good form as Arthur, who has the world turned upside down on him (literally). The rest of the cast is competent, but we don't really get to know them in a deep level.The problem with the plot for me was the fuzzy nature of the dream-world itself_one can ask many questions that could go on forever. Having been familiar with films like Dreamscape and Nightmare on Elm Street, I have always assumed pretty much everything was possible in a dream world. The dream world in this film is much closer to reality, but I couldn't exactly understand the established limits of possibility within that reality. For example, why can't someone be bulletproof if you know it's a dream? Things get stranger when people enter a dream within that dream using the device--this was the part where the plot got a bit too convoluted for me. In my logic, if a dream is an illusion, an illusion within an illusion is basically the same illusion except it's only making us think it's a different kind of illusion_but, I won't expand on that. Simply put, I think the script should've cleared up better on how dreams operated in this particular world.I might have appreciated this film more on a smaller budget. It could've been a more cerebral film that explored the concepts more deeply than have it covered with action scenes with everything happening in elaborate ways. Similar to how I felt about Steven Spielberg's A.I., the budget appeared to exceed the need of the film's concept, even if the effects were cool. It also reminded me of Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York, a similarly cerebral, yet equally plot-heavy film, about a theater director who creates a life-size replica of New York inside a big warehouse and within that warehouse is another smaller warehouse with a smaller replica, and on, and so forth. Like that film, this film seems to get lost in its excess of plot ideas it wants to explore. Perhaps it might've worked better as a mini-series.Overall, I felt the film could've been tighter and trimmed. There are many action scenes that didn't really contribute to the plot and occasionally seemed to slow down the film, such as the James Bond-influenced gunfight in the mountains. One of the problems about films about dreams is that one assumes a character is never in any real trouble and no action seems extraordinary (while it may be surprising in real life), thrilling, or risky, because it's all ""illusion,"" if you will. When the plot had the character go within a dream within a dream within a dream, it was just a bit too much for me. The concept is interesting, and there are certainly no movies like it, but there appears to be an overload of too many things going on.For more of my reviews, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",1

"Inception an event that is a beginning; a first part or stage of subsequent events.I put this definition up as a compliment to this excellent film. Christopher Nolan wrote & directed this film & I have no doubt it is his best effort yet. While his films like Batman Begins & The Prestige are good films, this one goes beyond to where excellent is the only word which applies.Michael Caine seems to be in Nolan films a lot, but in this one Caine has his smallest role of any Nolan film. Taken in context, that fact and a still excellent film means high compliments. This is without a doubt Leonardo DiCaprio's best role on film. It is the best script by far that he has been involved with, even better than Titanic.Cobb (DiCaprio) is the center piece character that holds this whole film together. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is strong in support & this film actually has 2 women in strong support as Mal (Marion Cotillard) is Cobb's deceased wife & almost as much a part of the story as Ariadne. 7 other male actors are heavily involved too. This is Sci-Fi Suspense at it's finest. It is a mixture of the action of James Bond, the suspense of Hitchcock, & a stronger multi layered story so well written & constructed that the film flows by pulling in the viewer so completely that your surprised how late it is by the time you leave the theater.Two viewings could help though I believe on my first one I grasped pretty well what is going on. The second viewing could give me more insight into the story, & would still be just as entertaining I am sure. The ending will leave you breathless, satisfied, & mystified all in one package. That means it is a classic ending.The film does employ a couple of other bits of classic film making I recognized. That is not bad as this film is a breath of fresh air. Granted, the main actors all do well in their role, but the great story, strong script, & a film that is not overloaded with special effects but uses its effects to advance the story line in the right proportion, I rate it just about perfect.",1
"I couldn't agree with Kimba more. There is nothing to this film other than the special effects and crappy action sequences. The obvious story line is just as simple as the story in the Matrix and was hijacked form the same philosophy books that have been around for thousands of years.What They Wanted You To See: The special effects are very well done but reminded me of when I was thirteen and learned how to bend corners in photo-shop, for the next three month any picture I created in photo-shop had all the corners bent, I was so excited to show off my newly acquired skill. Same thing with the special effects in this film. How many times do I need to see Gordon- Levitt running, fighting and falling against the walls and ceilings in the hotel room scene? How many times do I have to see the buildings crumble and the van falling in slow motion. I get it, I get it, they figured out how to do this and they are excited to show it off. Great special effects, I would have been in awe regardless of what the plot line was...Just for me the quality of a good movie is one which you enjoyed and would love to see again. Although this movie does inspire some non-independent thinking and conversation; what I am hearing about this film is that many walked out without understanding it, by their own admission, and have no intention of seeing it again. If I saw this movie being played on cable I would flip the channel so fast it would make my TV smoke. But with that said, this will be another cult movie with the same old cult following, bah bah...You Do Not See This Because You Are Not Aware That You Are Dreaming A Dream Within A Dream: Here is the great part. The movie has a secondary plot line. Forget the whole dream idea and whether he is or he is not in a dream and who's dream he is in and why the kids are in the precisely same position, age and outfits in the last scene as they are in DiCaprio's previous recollections. Apparently the character of Leonardo DiCaprio is based on Nolan; the director. The film is about making a movie. DiCaprio is the director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the producer, Ellen Page is the screenwriter, Tom Hardy is the actor, Dileep Rao is the technical guy, Ken Watanabe is the money man behind the movie and Cillian Murphy is the audience.Do You Hear The Music?: The whole movie is explaining to the audience and the staff that you must create a semi believable world for the victim, the mark, the audience to be drawn in to. Its about scouting a location, creating a world and getting the audience lost in it, giving the director enough time to plant a non-original idea, such as, ""What a great movie this was!"" Anyone feel sorry for Cillian Murphy / Robert Fisher, Jr. because he was getting screwed with? well thats not Murphy that was getting screwed with, its all of us!Is Your Inner Ear Intact After All That Imax Noise, Because Here Comes Your Kick: According to DiCaprio's character or Nolan, If you alter the dream world too much, like Ellen Page did in DiCaprio's dream, the victim's/audience's subconscious will turn on you, realizing its fake/ a dream, and will turn on the manipulator of the dream, thus the screenwriter, director, etc. and become disengaged from the film/dream and wake-up, ""good afternoon, I am glad to see that you are awake.""Do You Remember Any Of It?: Do you remember when the original ""Architect"" gets killed off in the beginning? Well apparently it is very common in the movie industry to replace/remove the first screen writer. If you watch some of the interviews with DeCaprio he says that he is studying Noal for his character in the film, now you know why.Now, wipe off the morning-glory from your eyes and go outside and play.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is amazing movie.
This movie is brilliant,excellent,amazing and 100 other great things.",1
"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.",1
"***SPOILERS***""You are not the car you drive. You are not the contents of your wallet.""I agree. But I also think a movie is not its special effects, its flashy violence or its tacked-on incoherent twist ending. Let's be fair, this movie was probably THE thrill ride of 1999. But after repeated viewings, its flaws become painfully apparent.A lot of users on this board talk about the movie's message. What exactly is the message? That materialism is bad? This movie is as materialistic as they come. This movie is all about looking good, talking cool and dressing sharp. It's a quote mine, it tries to be a Tarantino movie minus the actual storytelling. The visuals are astounding and the acting is compelling, but the plot is totally incoherent. For example: if Tyler and the Narrator are the same person, what exactly happens right before the car accident? Is Tyler talking to himself? He has to be talking out loud since the two ""soldiers"" on the back seat answer his questions. That scene simply doesn't work. There is also the problem of the Narrator's name. Is he Tyler Durden? No one calls him by his name until the last minutes of the movie. Even the cop calling about the explosion in the condo doesn't call him by his name. On top of that, Tyler's decrepit house was bought ""under (the Narrator's) name"". I get the feeling that's an area the film-makers intentionally left grey so they wouldn't have to worry about it spoiling their ""great twist ending"".The movie would have been better if Tyler and the Narrator had not been the same person. But if they hadn't been, young male viewers wouldn't have left the theaters whispering ""Woah, that movie was f**ked up!"". I'm guessing that's the market and the reaction they were going for. (F.Y.I., I'm a 27 year old white male)To its credit, Fight Club makes you think. Unfortunately, if you think about it long enough, the movie caves in and falls apart. This movie is anger dressed up in cool clothes. It is to cinema what a Limp Bizkit album is to music.",1
"If Batman Begins was excellent, then Dark Knight is Superb. It was ambitious in its scope and depth, but it never fell short, and surpassed every expectation - not just as a comic book film either, but as an intricately plotted crime film, a hard hitting gangster film, and an edge of your seat thriller. It just hit the mark in every aspect.The acting is superb across the board, but with special mention for an utterly breath taking performance by Heath Ledger. He didn't just disappear into the role of the joker, he BECAME the Joker, chillingly so. Christian Bale once again brought integrity and subtlety to the role of Bruce Wayne, not to mention powerful menace and kick ass moves as Batman. I don't think anyone else who has played the role is even in his league. Its like all the others were impostors, and now the real Batman has stood up.The script is not only intelligent, well plotted and so insightful at times its almost profound (especially in the psychology of the Joker) it is completely gripping for the entire 2 and a half hours. I don't remember the last film I saw I could say that about. And although with some action films you get the feeling that the set pieces are just slotted in to look good for the trailers, in this film every action sequence is not only awesome to watch, its essential to the plot.But the thing I love most about this film (although its hard to pinpoint exactly) is the fact that it makes Gotham come alive as a real city. Its no longer the Gothic fantasy land of the Burton films (which then descended into burlesque farce in the next two unmentionable sequels). In Dark Knight Gotham is portrayed as a city you could believe exists, and that invests everything with a greater sense of credibility, realism, and consequently danger. Every punch, impact and explosion makes you wince, because it doesn't feel like staged fantasy violence anymore. People really can (and do) die, actions have serious consequences, and Batman is not an invulnerable superhero.Unlike with the pre-Nolan films, you never once question the plausibility of a man in a rubber bat suit fighting bad guys with advanced gadgets financed by his billion dollar empire. There is no self-consciousness, no tongue-in-cheek references to Batman's comic book origins to apologise for anything that seems far fetched. Because nothing in this movie seems far fetched at all. Thats what lifts Dark Knight above just a 'great comic book film' and makes it a true masterpiece of cinema.",1
"With an unbelievable shaking and monumental performance by Heath Ledger at the mere core of this sequel, it tremors an invigorating pulse throughout the rest of the extraordinarily well-crafted and strongly-conceived superhero tale that becomes more than just that, brushing necks with the cinematic heights of best picture contenders, and marking it's almost unduplicable bar as the easy pinnacle masterpiece of the superhero genre. (8.9/10)",1
"From the opening credits I was enraptured with this movie. The throwaway cleverness of the visuals, seen in the time-honored tradition of flashback, lends further cynicism to a film saturated with the nihilistic posturings and ideas from a very twisted and brilliant mind. I loved it - even though I sort of knew what the film was about I was surprised by how sophisticated it was. This is not a Brad Pitt film in the way that I imagine Meet Joe Black to be (never saw it, the trailer was enough). He acts much the same as he always did.Edward Norton is absolutely superb and the ultimate deadpan foil to the fantastic sequences that occur in the film. He rightly takes the lead for most of the movie and his sly, subversive comments are dropped with a poet's precision into each circumstance that our erstwhile anti-hero finds himself in.This is film belongs to the ""coming of age"" genre in that it is a voyage into self-discovery and coming to terms with the world that we live in. It'll change your outlook if nothing else.Must see.",1
"It's no surprise as to why this film tops the list. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of a lifetime and everyone will agree that he was robbed of a lot of awards that he deserved. Frank Darabont took a huge risk in putting a well used and clichéd idea to the screen and did what no director could ever do. He made the movie better than the book.I first watched the shawshank redemption in 2004 (10 years after it first came out) and remember myself being so intrigued and moved by a movie. I have never felt this much enthusiasm about a film before. It is without a doubt, the best motion picture of all time and if had been released now instead of 1994 I reckon it could have beaten Avatar and The hurt locker at the Oscars.10 out of 10 for the movie, the director and the actors who gave heartbreaking and moving performances, my hat goes off to them.",1
"""The Dark Knight"" clearly changed the way we look the blockbuster movies. This movie changed the superhero genre forever. So the rest of the genres. We can find influences in the most recent (and best) James Bond by Daniel Craig and an increasing number of outings from several franchises that include grounded themes, complex plots and a progressive retrospection about the world we live in these days, how we arrived here and where could we go.Right now it's very strange to see a fantasy movie or an action movie full of auto-parody which tries to take things hard without considering itself a parody (for example, a movie like ""True Lies"", ""Air Force One"" or the latest Brosnan Bond's: ""Die Another Day"" could be so embarrassing after 9-11 and even more in these problematic times). Even when we are looking for escapism and top notch entertainment (like Mission: Impossible franchise), that movies must include elements from the real world, dangerous connections rather than a crazy man who wants to rule the world or destroy it (look at ""Rogue Nation"" or both ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"", an example of a fine action movie done with the right characters and clear & present menaces that you could actually believe). Times have changed. And for better. Now we can look at a movie or a TV show and believe their stories, feel worried about the characters at the same time we love to be thrilled by the twisty or engaging plot.And for me, without ""The Dark Knight"", that couldn't be possible. Not at least in the way every big movie is presented right now. That grittiness, that darkness, that fear and reality mixed with action, comic book suspense and surprises every-wear. This movie changed the cinema. This movie had it all and stills having it all. It's a eternal classic. A modern masterpiece that sets the bar at the highest and beyond.I could talk about the direction, music, performances, the unstoppable Heath Ledger, that insane script... But nearly 5,000 people wrote about that before me. And that's a proof of something big, unique and timeless. I don't care if it didn't won the Best Picture Oscar. I don't care if it's not the number 3, 2 or 1 in the spot. It's a great movie by a great legacy of itself. A legacy that was so eventful, so impactive and came so surprising like the shocking and unforgettable Joker at every attack of his. For me, a cinema lover from Spain, ""The Dark Knight"" is the perfect movie. My perfect movie, my favorite one. Period.",1
"Okay, I came out the cinema literally ten minutes ago. Yes the movie was tremendous, yes Heath Ledger gave a fine performance; but it is far from a work of originality in the art of film-making.The Story... Put very briefly: Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) has hopes of becoming obsolete; not least to reunite with darling Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). A man named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) takes charge of bringing justice to the streets, eager to prove to society that they don't need the help of Batman. Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger), an unrelenting villain who just ""wants to watch the world burn""; a man who wallows in anarchy. Batman reluctantly assumes personal responsibility for his elimination. The snag is that the Joker generates a conflict between our repentant desire for his disposal and our abhorrence in his retention. Conversely, said friction is nevertheless ambiguous as this is principally a product of Ledger's well-integrated alluring, dark humour.The Review... Nothing about Christopher Nolan's film is candidly provocative: it is doubtless far in merit from the present cinematic cultural phenomenon it seems to be stirring; the death of its star has unquestionably fuelled the effect it is having on audiences. When Ledger's face first appears on screen, it is impossible to distract oneself from his recent passing; so this morally justified praise is surely transient.The biggest displeasure was that the emotional impact lasted only for the film's duration: as I left the theatre, the automatic doors opened for me onto a busy street and everything that had just affected me on the other side of them, dissipated into the noise of the traffic. I wasn't disturbed or introspective; I wasn't concerned or upset: in fact, I felt pretty good. But I don't think I should have. Films should induce a lasting response. So whilst making an attempt to inject a syringe-full of emotive contemporary issues and examining the current state of this planet, the liquid sentiment that fell from the needle was only enough to drug me for the two-and-a-half-hours that is lasted: in consequence, feelings are left sullied and detached. And movie nostalgia should incontestably recall more than just the action ? which, on the other hand was positively impressive.Arguably, reality through fantasy only truly works when one can fully connect with the vision's subject. Nolan has done great wonders with the comic book adaptations and to criticize his creativity would be unjust and excessive. Batman appears real enough but the inflexible artificiality of his being is sufficient for our imagination to keep him from fruition, and is instead rather a constant reminder that Gotham really is another world: Batman is the Verfremdungseffekt. Some films bring you inside the world they encompass, whereas to its own disappointment, The Dark Knight predominantly holds you afar: a bystander's view of a distressed planet; I didn't have an intimate enough connection to believe that this could be our own. I was indeed so close, but that is always just too far. Nonetheless, there were moments when its scrutiny of human relationships and societal conduct did besiege me ? and well at that. Thankfully too, the CGI and stunts were primarily kept to an appropriate, watchable, sensible level; consequently they were more intense and convincing.Along with the fantastic pulsating score, the acting is what keeps the film alive. Ledger is especially brilliant and he markedly surpasses the other cast members, who in contrast give engaging yet run of the mill performances. Is Heath's performance Oscar-worthy? Debatably so but I remain hesitant.To conclude, I certainly give out a recommendation to see this movie but, like most others, it is rich with content appealing purely to a mindset that whilst common, is still particular and genre-associated.",1
"Without a doubt I would consider this movie one of the best that I have seen and I watch it every so often and no matter how many times I watch it I get the same experience, I cant really say that about really any other movie, this movie is well worth the watch, in my opinion. It has one of the most satisfying climaxes in cinema history as well which is a great plus.",1
"The wonderful subject
Good visual effects
Nice making and the sound quality of movie
Is awesome all the best for the entire team and
Movie make a defanitly success",1
"The Dark Knight is a superhero movie directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Late Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman in the leads.The movie is the second part of the Batman Trilogy.This movie was and will always be remembered for one of the most iconic portrayal of a villain 'Joker' which is perfectly played by late Ledger, although Christian Bale is an outstanding actor but is outshone in few scenes by him.Screenplay is gripping and I haven't seen such an evenly paced screenplay. Casting director should also deserves a credit for the best selection of the characters although strictly in my opinion to some extent the only misfit character was Maggie Gyllenhaal as she wasn't able to continue the charm and charisma created by the beautiful Katie Holmes.The cinematography is another strong talking point of movie and the mesmerising music by the great Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is treat for your ears.This is one of the most finest superhero movies I've ever seen with a strong climax with intelligent screenplay and yes the iconic Heath'Joker'Ledger. Heath is no more with us but will always be immortal in his iconic portrayal.",1
"This film is complete in all sense. The dialogues were breathtaking, action sequences(shot using IMAX cameras) were marvellous, good humor, great acting & everything you want to see in a movie. The Dark Knight Redefines the superhero movie genre and sets the bar to an almost unachievable height. Heath Ledger(Joker) was mind blowing & totally insane{The Academy did justice by handing over him the Oscar}. You have to admire & love him. This is definitely going down as one of my all-time favourite movie. JUST WATCH IT At least ONCE & JUDGE YOURSELF. I may not be the first to recommend this but i wont be the last... 9.7/10",1
"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",1

This movie would not be as good if it weren't for Heath Ledger's performance. The movie would still be good but not a 10/10. Christian Bale does his normal Batman routine however he seems more intrigued this time around. Overall amazing film.,1
"The movie really seems to have moved me. Its a Story that arouses hope within an individual. it reminds me of the famous lines from the a great poem that ""when winter comes spring cant be far behind"".The movie revolves around the two character Andrew Dufresne and Red. Andy Dufresne, is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realizes there is something deep inside your body, that people can't touch and get to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red (Morgan Freeman), and Andy epitomizes why it is crucial to have dreams. His spirit and determination, leads us into a world full of imagination, filled with courage and desire. This is about how he spreads his message of hope through the Shashank Redemption!!!A must watch!! although it may don't seem so great at the beginning but the ending is marvelous which makes it a masterpiece!!!

So good. Love the plot. And the music. And the cinematography. And everything. So yea.,1
"As I said a lot of times: the best thing in a movie is the story. You don't have a good story, you can have the best actors and the best crew creating full worlds and CGI... it's worthless.Excellent idea! I loved to concept of the film. It was brilliant to see the story unfolding in front of your eyes like an onion, layer by layer, forcing your brain to make fast connections following the story thread that was suspended in time. Superb.The acting was beautiful and everything else in the movies. It's one of my favourites for sure! And I know that idea wasn't an inception... Maybe I should watching again soon... Hope that one wasn't an inception. No... It wasn't. I really like this movie.",1
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have seen. The movie encompasses friendship and hope in though circumstances. The movie is simple and hasn't a lot of technical merits but that isn't needed. The message of the producer is beautiful and the movie is an all time favorite.,1
When I signed up for the IMDB they ask you what your favourite movie is? Shawshank rose to the top of my mind immediately.  This film brought hope and inspiration to most hopeless and soul robbing of environments.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic! Does Steven King have more stories like this one?,1

With the help of a new crew, Cobb must overcome his fears and delve deeper than anyone has done before.Don't come up to me and say this film is overrated because it really isn't. I don't believe it deserves a spot as one of the Greatest Movies of all Time, that is fair. But this movie is a masterpiece on every level. I have but ONE, minor flaw with this movie. Aside from that, it is one of the closest things to perfect in recent memory. I HIGHLY recommend you see this movie if you have not.The concept for this movie is amazing. It hurts my head to think about the logic of it but I'll be dammed if it isn't awesome. The story surrounding this concept is so well thought out and intricately designed that it is hard to dislike it. The ending for this movie is one of my personal favourite movie endings of all time. It is pure genius. If you dislike the movie, fine, I disagree with you heavily but fine. But if you think that ending is stupid, I actually hate you.My one and really only flaw with this film is with some of the dialogue. As much as I love Christopher Nolan, his dialogue can occasionally be too exposition heavy. I 100% understand it was a necessary evil for this film but I still think it was overused. There are a LOT of characters/actors in this movie so I will be brief on the subject. Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent in this movie as Cobb. Ellen Page was great as Ariande. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was excellent as Arthur. 'You mustn't be afraid to Dream a little bigger, darling!' basically sums up the greatness of Tom Hardy's performance as Eames. Marion Cotillard was great as Mal. Cillian Murphy was great as Fischer, as was Ken Wantanabe as rival Saito. Dileep Rao was good as Yusuf but his role was so minute for me to genuinely pay attention. Every character in this movie served a key role to the story and all of them felt important. Even if people like Yusuf were sidelined for the leads, they still felt like they had a purpose.The cinematography for this movie is amazing and there are countless shots in this film that took my breath away. The editing is also exceptional. The visual and practical effects are literally mind. Hans Zimmer's score in this movie is phenomenal. This movie IS, a technical marvel.It is a complex, riveting journey from minute one and I cannot stress enough how amazing this movie is and how much I recommend it. Please, if you have not, see this movie... but be prepared to pay attention. It is 2 1/2 Hours long but it felt like 90 minutes. It is a technical marvel and I'll rate Inception a flawless rating of 10 Totems out of 10.",1
Everything about this movie is amazing. MUST WATCH!,1
"What can be said that hasn't already been recorded by now?  You either love this film, or you don't understand it.  And it seems that the latter is more common than the former.  It is often described as disturbing, violent, and confusing.  Typical comments from spoon fed movie goers that would rather see Lucas destroy a legacy by Disney perportions.  Fight Club makes you think.  If you don't walk away questioning, yourself, and s**t you've accumulated to make you feel better about the state your life is in, then you're beyond convention help and need to have your ass kick.  Fight Club is disturbing.  It's one of it's stronger attributes.  Sometimes it takes something that makes us uncomfortable before we can see things for how they really are.  The words of Tyler Durdan are only now coming true; Martha Stuart, f**k Martha Stuart.  Martha Stuart is shining doorknobs on the Titanic.  Only now do we see how true that is.",1
"Cons : This movie is kinda very slow-paced, but it might fit its nature and its plot.However, this should not be the first movie of all time, because it , as a matter of fact, isn't. The Godfather, for instance, deserves the title.From an other perspective, it's kinda unfortunate to not see Red playing the Harmonica, that would have been a good part too...I can see the whole ""Brooks"" arc a waste of time, that could've been shrunk within very few minutes.Halas ! Few more cons would be stated , but I'd go with the pros : A movie that beats all expectations, so is the plot, and so does it, because whenever you see a scene , you expect something, but it goes otherwise.The ending is really good, few movies manage to strike the bullseye when it comes to endings. The Shawshank redemption did the job fortunately, and it delivered.The plot's exciting-radiation was on its climax with the last quarter of the movie.Worth 8 and not 9.3.",1
"This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.",1
"Went to the first day first show at a local multiplex and have come back completely awestruck !! I had been wondering if the film would be able to live up to all the hype....more so post Heath Ledger's untimely demise and after watching let me tell you this : The Dark Knight far surpasses the hype around it !!!!! Christopher Nolan's latest take on Batman is better in almost every way than it's predecessor, ""Batman Begins"" which was an excellent film in it's own right. The sequel is darker,grittier and even more intense while at the same time possessing enough surprises to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat. While previous movies of the batman genre tended to be over-cartoonish in my opinion, Nolan has brought about a refreshing change of direction, which, coupled to a strong and sharp script makes this 2:45 thrill ride exhilarating. The first thing that struck me after seeing the movie was that how the film managed to keep it's intensity intact for every second of it's run time despite being nearly three hours long, astonishing to say the least. further the action was always short and sweet, no long drawn fighting sequences which begin to drag on after a while. CGI effects were kept to a minimum and the action sequences, while being as awesome as they can be, never looked surreal. And then there was Heath Ledger.........Warner Brothers has promised to launch an Oscar campaign if Heath Ledger's role was appreciated enough, and I see that coming inevitably. Heath Ledger steals the show from a cast filled with great actors and solid performers with his sheer madness and vision for the character of joker. His portrayal of the smiling assassin is unmatched amidst villains of any class that i have seen. The unpredictability, the instability, the genius, the cunning, the evil inside the character are so beautifully , frighteningly but realistically portrayed by Ledger that it makes one think whether it affected his own mind as well. He'll keep you gaping through most of the movie with this superlative performance, sadly his last completed appearance in films. One wonders what he might have achieved had he still been here........The rest of the cast is super solid. Christian Bale is as good as ever,Morgan Freeman is his usual classy self, Michael Caine fits Alfred like a glove and Aaron Eckhert as District Attorney Harvey Dent is extra special. Only Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes didn't make much of an impact on me, she didn't even look good on screen in my opinion. The music score is just right and the cinematography is breathtaking.The script writing by Jonathan Nolan is exemplary in terms of wit,grit and pacing. Gotham looks as Dark and foreboding as it should, but never unrealistically so.It looks big and brooding, the perfect hunting ground for the caped crusader !! And ,of course, the Batpod, i.e the motorcycle makes a smashing entry in his movie and looks a cut above everything we've seen in past Batman movies.....""Batman Begins"" in 2005 took my vote for the best superhero movie of all times. It is rare to see sequels surpass the original but "" The Dark Knight"" has stolen my vote from it's predecessor in fantastic style. At the end of the day when you come out of the theater you are sure to feel that you've got your money's worth. In our case it got a standing ovation from the audience !!! RATING : 9.9/10 (0.1 left out for Maggie Gyllenhaal)+1(coz i am a Batman fan)= 10.9/10 (to the uninitiated, that means don't even dream of missing it !!!!!)",1
"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.",1
"If you like ""Flatliners,"" ""What Dreams May Come"" and ""Ocean's 12"" then this movie is ""Citizen Kane.""
Incredible cinematography and fine acting.
Worth it.",1
This is one movie I never tire of watching. 27 times and going strong!!!,1
"Lets get straight to the point. The plot is set out to perfection. it doesn't rush itself and tells the story brilliantly. The way it elegantly portrays the jokers sick humour when threatening the 2 boats containing prisoners and citizens. not to mention the tension when one boat has to blow up the other leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. The film also shows that batman is shown not be a unbeatable hero and has a side of realism that christopher nolan directs really well. But my favourite thing about the dark knight is the excellent acting of the late heath ledger and his role of the joker is quirky, sinister and what makes the dark knight one of my favourite films of all time.",1
"Just the best movie I ever seen!
I think if it will be possible to have a second part.
equaly crazy and awesome.",1
"One of my all time favourite movies. The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. Definitely worth the watch, if you haven't seen it. You are missing out. It is well written, scripted and well acted by Freeman and Robbins. This classic will be one that can be watched over and over. Frank Darabont made this the classic it is.",1
For a movie to be considered the best ever made i feel the all aspect of the movie should be amazing and rase no question as to why it is simply the best. Do not mis understand me here i think the store is great. Its just was everything else about the film amazing.,1
Heath ledger's acting alone almost makes this the perfect film it's full of action of much better then the average superhero movie.,1
"Piece of art indeed, love it so much
the cast is so great",1
"I dunno, I'm a 90's baby (born in 1990) and I loved this movie. It just has so much going for it. Great and well fleshed out characters, the soundtrack, the story telling itself, just everything to me is fantastic. I guess it's just one of those things that just feels organic for some and not so much for others. Don't delve too much into WHY you didn't like the movie as much as others did, just accept that the movie just didn't have the same impact to you as it did to others, because I don't think this is one of those movies you can really explain.I feel the same way about The Big Lebowski. So many people name it as one of the greatest comedies of all time, and I just think it's meh...*puts up flame retardant shield*",1
"Visual effects, stage design, the actors were all amazing. The story is certainly one of the most original we've seen for some time. Most critical comments said that some parts are too unbelievable, but I disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were certainly in the 'fiction' of sci-fi. This film deals more with concepts that we, the common people do not know them too well. We have no idea what size the 4th or 5th, and no one yet knows what it's like traveling through a ""black hole"" or ""wormhole"" or to explore away from our planet other planets and galaxies. I do not think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when you have absolutely no idea what would be credible in those conditions. Anyway, great story written by Nolan, who will certainly be nominated for the Oscar. Hans Zimmer's music was again very good and was perfectly integrated into the film. Intestellar is a film not to be missed, even by those not interested in science fiction movies. A production that I personally consider the best achievement of Christopher Nolan so far.",1
Really good film but i think it's time to make a second !,1
"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!",1
"Confession Bear: This is the first Brad Pitt movie I ever watched. Someone once told me Brad Pitt is just an OK actor, but boy were they wrong. Brad Pitt made the movie!The plot ~ Fight Club really keeps you entertained. The story and characters are really interesting and mysterious. One thing I really liked about it was that it wasn't cliché and it didn't take too long to build up the plot. Whenever a movie is cliché or takes to long to get the story going BAM it's suddenly a bad movie. But not this one. This was amazing.Casting ~ Casting was perfect.",1
"This is a movie to be watched over and over.  Each time I get a little bit more out of it.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together.  Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King (one of my favorite authors) novel, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", especially since it is not of the horror/sci-fi genre. I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list.",1
There is a lot of Hidden intellect that make you think about it,1
My favourite move of all time! This film has inspired me to not only act but write and direct films of my own. Thank you Christopher Nolan and please keep the masterpieces coming.,1
"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",1
"For the sake of reading a huge review, I'll keep this one short and directly to the point. First of all, you can't ask for a much better cast than this one. Usually any movie including Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing. Then you also have Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy which makes for an even better cast. Besides the cast, the plot is also fantastic. The idea of having this inception of dreams, or dreams within dreams makes for a very interesting and intriguing movie. With that being said, this movie will be sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. There are a bunch of little twist and turns you might not expect and results in unexpected and interesting times. Overall, it's a fantastic movie and I would highly recommend watching it if one has not done so yet.",1
"The hype-machine has done it again! Convinced everyone that if you don't find this movie outstanding then you are just not that smart.The plot is really not that hard to understand. Cobb job is to steal ideas from people's minds, which is done in their dreams during dream-sharing. Cobb wants to go home to his children, but cannot because he has been accused of murdering his wife. By planting a dream in a persons mind, some powerful people will clear his name, so he can see his children again. Pretty simple.The main problem with this movie is the plot holes and irregularities in the rules set up during the movie. Eg. what is the point to the architect? How can the dream devices be in the dreams whit-in a dream (did the architect put them there, and how?)? You can hear through many levels of dreaming, but not feel twisted gravity? Can people just fall a sleep on demand? etc. etc. etc.Even if one did not care about plot holes, there is an even bigger problem with the movie! There are plots going on at the same time on four levels of dreaming. Because we have to jump back and forth all the time the plot loses its intensity and depth.On the positive side, the movie has excellent acting and visuals. The idea is relatively original (cough the matrix, cough Tron, cough any worlds-within-another-word movies). Its good to see some new-thinking in Hollywood instead of crap like Transformers, sequels and remakes.All together the movie is nothing but mediocre. Lets hope that The Expendables will live up to the hype, else this will have been a pretty bad action movie season!",1
"In my opinion, this film is brilliant. Acting game, plot-- everything in this film are beautiful, especially Tayler Durden who was played by Brad Pitt. And at the same time, this movie makes you to think about your vital values. But i noticed one disadvantage in this film- acting game of Helena Bonem Carter. Her character was badly described, in my opinion. And while watching for her actions, she seems very excess. But generally, thi film is awesome",1
"when i saw top movie ranking i found this one but my point of view is this this movie is good but also made a hope for jail broken theme ..this is also not a good over all good example for best hope .... :). OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.""",1
"the dark knight was an outstanding action film that proved to be a lot stronger and more darker then the original batman films. but heath ledgers performance was amazing! the joker scenes were all wonderful, and it was really entertaining to watch. however, i was expecting a little more after all this hype on the film. still, it is a very good movie. it was also cool how there wasn't a lot of CGI in the movie. they got to actually blow things up in Chicago, which i must say, is pretty cool. i recognized a lot of places. however i am confused how the third sequel will be now. but anyway, the dark knight is dark and explosive, and i LOVE IT!",1
Absolute masterpiece i missed great flim while i grow up!,1
Search anywhere else i bet u won't find this kind of content or anything near to this...what an incredibly Genius Movie this deserves an applaud for the kind of Cinematography and Story..even the characters who played were so genuine of course including Caprio ?,1
"One of the best movies I've ever seen! I recommend it to everyone who hasn't watch this, there's no word to explain this beauty of a movie! Just perfection!",1
"INTRODUCTION: ""The Dark Knight"" is the second installment in the Batman trilogy by writer/director Christopher Nolan. The film is written by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan and the films story would be conceived by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer. The film is ranked as the 4th best movie of all time (according to IMDb) and won 2 Oscars. I'm here to talk of why it's just a okay movie and not a masterpiece as some people believe.GOOD: - The Writing - The Acting - The last 45 minutesOKAY: - The directing - Some of the action - There are some questionable things in this movie such as: Why did no kids or bus drivers notice the bus that rolls out of the bank? How did Batman and Rachel not die when hitting the car? Why didn't Batman quickly take out Joker at the party? If Batman doesn't kill... Then why does he kill?! - Health Ledger's Joker (I'll explain later) - An OKAY Crime FilmBAD: - Cristinan Bale' Batman (I'll explain later) - The film's time length - NOT THE BEST BATMAN MOVIE!!!CONCLUSION: Some people may be questioning my choice of why I think the Joker's portrayal is okay and why Batman's portrayal is bad. Here's why... The Joker is okay because he's not the Joker! He's a up and coming crime man who tries to prove his craziness... And this may sound stupid but... He's to quotable. I say this because... Whenever someone talks about the Joker they say the same dang line ""Why so serious?! Do you wanna know how I got these scars?!"" I've heard it so much that I want to turn off whatever I'm watching. And every time someone portrays the Joker the first things critics will say is: ""He's not as good at Heath Ledger"". How people should think of it is ""Heath was great form Nolan's universe... Jared's Joker is interesting for the new universe... Jack's portrayal is a good Tim Burton villain"" etc. Every superhero movie in general HAS TO LIVE UP TO ""The Dark Knight"". Cristian Bale's Batman is bad because: A. I can barely stand his voice B. I don't understand what he says all the time... Both as Batman (gargle) and Bruce Wayne (scratchy whisper) C. Bale's Batman can't fight (considering he was trained by Ninga's) D. Batman is not the world greatest detective because he only relies on gadgets and not brains E. Bruce Wayne is a selfish butthole and F. Barman has a chance of dying with everything he does but somehow manages not to die... Like I said when falling hundreds of stories and landing on a car. The time length is also way, WAY to long. I put it on one time at 7:00 and fell asleep at 8:00. They could've cut it down by like half an hour. Overall, it's not a amazing movie and should be held as a must need to be a good superhero rather than standing alone as it's own. The only movie to match the film so far is ""Logan"" (which I still need to see). ""Logan"" supposedly might be the first superhero film to win Best Picture. SCORES: 3 / 11 good things. 5 / 11 okay things. 3 / 11 bad things. Mark Hamill is (and always will be) my favorite Joker of all time... Just saying.",1
"The problem with a lot of superhero films is that they are almost all glorified kid-movies are. That's not the case with TDK who is a sequel to the 2005 smash-hit Batman Begins where Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) revived Batman, who was thanks to Joel Schumacher turned into a childish stupid Batman. Nolan cutted the crap, introduced Christian Bale, a serious tormented superhero, and now takes it one step further, that's why TDK is not just a superhero movie but also a serious action-thriller is. The show is stolen by of course Heath Ledger (RIP), who as the insane chaotic Joker, the best performance in his life, definitely a posthumous Oscar deserves. The Joker is an insane psychopath who terrorizes Gotham, steals Money from mob bosses, and treats us with excellent one liner ""To them you're just a freak, like me!"" with that creepy voice and a snake likely tongue he says that to Batman, to who Gotham is completely turned. The movie is about the battle between good and evil, but also over mass hysteria and the fact that the public is easy to manipulate. Maybe does Nolan to much stories put in the film, that's the reason for the long length and that the horrible head of two-face looks a bit too much CGI. On the other hand, every character in the film is played by a top class actor who makes it 100 percent quality. TDK is not only the best superhero film i saw in years, it's a good solid thriller. with an Unforgettable Heath Ledger. Too bad he couldn't see that he was so good in it Jens Naeyaert",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",1

"It was after I heard a lot of friends tell me what a great movie this is, that I decided to finally watch it. I must say it is not a movie but an experience. Really like the way how the story progresses and concludes. Excellent performances that result in characters leaving a mark in memory. A movie that I watch once in every 6 months.",1
"To think that this movie belongs in the top 100 movies of all time let alone the top five is ludicrous. You bet, it' quite a spectacle. But spectacle doesn't make a great movie. There's one truly great character and everyone knows it's Heath Ledger's Joker. That was a magical paring of great writing and great acting.But what happened to the rest of the movie? Besides The Joker the film is merely almost good. That is if you like exceedingly dark and depressing movies that have little if anything to feel good about. It's mildly suspenseful at times but much of the action is telegraphed. Let's see some more stupid police who can't see another Joker getaway coming from a mile away.I'm no wimp -- I can be engrossed by and accept wholesale carnage when it's in something like ""Saving Private Ryan"" -- but this is yet another movie in which it doesn't matter how many faceless civilians and police die just as long as there can be lots of shooting and car crashes and the stars are OK.And what of poor Batman? Christian Bale does a creditable job in the role, yet this is really a movie about The Joker. The hero and who he is isn't nearly as well explored as the villain.Besides Ledger the two old pros, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman, play the most interesting characters. Gary Oldman does a decent job as James Gordon. The problem is we're never given any reason to doubt him yet there is this undercurrent to the character that maybe he's not really working for the good guys.The scene where Batman hunts The Joker as SWAT teams come crashing into the building is one of the most confusing messes I've seen. There's no clear idea what's happening and why and The Joker's final capture is anticlimactic. The turn to the dark side by character Harvey Dent is poorly developed and in the final scenes, lacking much logic. And the suspension of logic -- especially when it comes to the evil doing of The Joker -- just goes too far.In the end, despite Batman's expected saving of the child, the movie simply peters out with a muddled message and Batman zooming off on his motorcycle in the direction of -- we can only presume -- another sequel.If you want a dark, action-packed film then see ""Quantum of Solace."" It's not a great film -- not nearly as good as ""Casino Royal"" -- but it's a fair shot better than ""The Black Knight.""",1
"What many have written as criticism for Nolan's latest cinematic endeavors, I applaud: Christopher Nolan takes himself seriously. For me, personally, films that attempt to draw me into a story without requiring me to think or even to draw upon more profound emotions and/or intelligence don't remain with me for very long. I want to enjoy a movie in the theater or at home and then keep enjoying it because it's content or portrayal is so compelling that I find mind migrating back to scenes or experiences in the film. I do enjoy sitting down to a fun, exciting movie solely for the purpose of entertainment. Inception, however, is not one of those movies. Everyone has dreams. After watching Inception, I found myself musing on the impossibilities and possibilities of dreams. I found myself wanting write down my dreams more often. That's the kind of movie Inception is: the kind that becomes a part, even if it's a small part, of my life. It becomes a place my mind can roam to for engaging thought and feeling. If Christopher Nolan did not take himself or his films so seriously, I'm not sure this level of personal influence could be achievable.",1
"One of the best movies I have ever seen. I love Stephen King, and I am always excited to see one of his books turned into a movie. Shawshank Redemption is an classic, a movie that everyone should watch. I loved the chemistry between the two main actors. For people who have not read the book (but also for the book lovers) the movie will be an exciting experience till the last scene.Even now, after more than 20 years, modern movies cannot be compared to this one. Morgan Freeman is as always excellent. U get an mix of emotions watching Shawshank redemption. You feel sad, happy, compassionate, all at the same time for prisoners... Brooks as a character and his story-line broke my heart and i still feel the sadness for this character.",1
"This film is hard, exciting, realistic, beautiful and surprising. The Shawshank Redemption completely absorbs you and constantly throws you back and forth between joy and sadness. It simply blew me away, and if it was possible, I would give it 11 without thinking twice.",1
"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested. A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it. Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequence-less violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.Watch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends. 10 out of 10.",1
"""You do not talk about fight club!"". I walked out of the movie theater a different man with a new view on how to make a good film that can really capture your mind. This film is absolutely brilliant! Edward Norris is one of the best young actors in America right now, and he will improve. I don´t want to write about the plot of the movie Fight Club, because I would probably spoil it for the others who haven´t seen it. So I recommend everyone who have not seen it to take a couple of hours of their IKEA life and see it!!! It´s worth it. My little white-collar-boring-to-death-perspective on life has changed a little since I saw it. Even if you are a Brad Pitt-hater, go and see it. I was before I saw Fight Club, but today I am reborn Brad Pitt-lover.",1
The acting in this film was outstanding. I was hooked from beginning to end.,1
"This is a very novel subject, we will think about it, for the dream we should choose to distinguish. It's an extension of the unknown, and it's the mystery we'll ultimately solve in the future. The film gave me a new idea for thinking about dreams. Does thinking necessarily react according to matter? Could it be a parallel space-time, a response from other dimensions? The other dimensions react and then think through the material.",1
"What is ""The Fight Club""? Maybe the strongest and most daring movie of the year. David Fincher is brilliant. He has this amazing capacity to make movies electrical, powerful and disturbing. The smallest details of this movie are so well-done that the final result was perfect. The movie is about a man. A man lost in a pathetic life where collecting furniture was his major excitement. A man who couldn't sleep. A man looking for salvation. After meeting Tyler Durden, his life changes in many ways. He discovers his violent side, his willing to be free. Both create the ultimate therapy for people who can't find a meaning to their lives: The Fight Club.There men beat each other only to feel alive. Is this impossible? How many people enjoy boxing anyway? After the club becomes famous, though, Tyler starts to create something that will go out of control soon, and that will change that man's life forever. Fantastic dialogues. Amazing character development. A much better twist then 6th sense's. A flawless complex script. Very funny moments. Very tense moments. Nonsense. Insanity. Mischief. Mayhem. Soap.This movie really can rock your world. It made me feel much different about life itself, and is one of the best movies EVER. Highly recommended to anyone who likes to think. Edward Norton is amazing. Brad Pitt does his job well and David Fincher shows us once again that he has a great potential and must keep us addicted to his movies. A high praise to the guy who wrote the book as well. There is a guy who knows lots about humanity. 10/10",1
"A true cinematic experience rarely give you is to live a life. A masterpiece that takes you through all possible feelings and makes you want to never end. But, alas, all good things end too quickly is found, as in this case. Frank Darabont certainly has its place set for. eternity with cinema heavyweights, as Stephen King can be considered one of the best contemporary writers; Tim Robbins made the role his career and Morgan Freeman Morgan Freeman's, that is simply good. A must-see film at least once !!!One of the best movies ever made and one of my all time favorites. He manages to capture your attention from the very first frame and keep you connected almost 2 and a half hours. Best part made by Robbins and Morgan Freeman a sensational that the voice and his way of being shown a steady state of maturity and peace of mind. Frank Darabont filmed exceptional novel as a great writer Stephen King and deserves its place among the great values of cinema. A movie not to be missed for any art lover and one of the film that deserves at least two viewings.",1
"I have now seen Inception three times. That's right, three times. The only other film that I have seen three times in theaters was M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water. Why I saw that film three times in the theater is a question that I will never know the answer to. At least with Inception, I had a good reason for seeing it three times in theaters. Inception is no doubt the best film of the year and possibly the best film of the twenty-first century. Yeah, it's that good. Inception is smart, entertaining, thrilling, and just plain brilliant.The director of the film, Christopher Nolan, has not made a bad film to date. His most notable films would be the infamous The Dark Knight, the challenging Memento, and the fun The Prestige. With his new film Inception, he has made his best work to date.If you haven't seen the film yet you are probably confused as to what the film is about being that the various trailers and movie posters give no clues as to what the plot of the film is. Since I have seen the film three times I am pretty clear on the plot of the film so I will give you a spoiler-free description.The film stars Leo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cobb and Arthur, two men who are hired by people to steal secrets from people's dreams, which is called extraction. When their mission to steal the secrets from a man named Saito (played by Ken Watanabe) fails, Cobb is afraid that he will never get to see his children again and that his charges will never be cleared. Fortunately Saito decides that instead of killing Arthur and Cobb, he offers them a job but instead of extraction, he wants inception. Inception is essentially the exact of opposite extraction: instead of stealing an idea from someone's dream, you plant and idea in someone's dream. Cillian Murphy plays the guy who is the target for inception, named Robert Fischer. His dad is the head of a major corporation and is on his death bed so that when he dies, Robert Fischer will be the head honcho. Saito wants Cobb to the plant the idea that Fischer should split up his father's company so that Saito's empire will rise to power. Cobb and Arthur decide to accept the mission and begin to assemble their team. Their new team members are Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao). It seems like everything is going to go according to plan if it were not for Cobb's dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard) who keeps appearing in his dreams. The rest of the film is their attempt at accomplishing their mission.Everything about this film is perfect. I will start with the acting. Every performance in this film is very good but there are three that stand out. The first is Ellen Page's performance as Ariadne. She plays someone who is new to the idea of dreaming and creation and it is because of that that the audience can relate to her. Like her the audience is new to this idea of going inside dreams in this sort of way and Page's performance exemplifies the idea of bewilderment. Marion Cotillard is also extremely good as Cobb's wife. Her character is very haunting and beautiful at the same time and it was just a very enchanting performance. The third performance that stood out for me was Cillian Murphy's performance as Fischer. His character is basically being manipulated into creating an emotional catharsis with his dad but his performance is very real and very strong.The other things that make this film great are the special effects and the action sequences. The effects in this movie are really great because they look so real. My favorite effects sequences would have to be when the city of Paris folds on top of itself. The action sequences in the movie are just incredible. There is one scene in particular that involves a rotating hallway that is definitely one of the best fight scenes of all time.If you have not gotten the chance to see Inception you need to get off you computer or whatever device you are using to read this and go see it now! It's an amazing, intelligent, brilliant masterpiece.",1
"Absolute best movie I have ever saw. Hands down the acting is out of this world and the story is amazing. I felt that Tim Robbins performance was perfection. I thought all of the other characters were very believable in their respective roles, from Red being the guy who can get things to Brooks, who played the best character as the man afraid to reneter civilization after a lifetime behind bars.",1
"Pure genius, apocalyptic, and brilliant.  David Fincher succeeds yet again with another amazing movie, and better than his previous two, and combining both is some aspects.  He takes the darkness of The Game, and the erie feeling of Seven, and puts them both into Fight Club, and of course, comes out with yet another vibrant film. Fight Club shows the world what we all want to be.  It shows the sides that we don't want to see, that society cannot grasp in public, but dreams about when they are alone.  It depicts the life we wish we had.  Simple, violent, and anarchistict(heh).   This movie repels the people who criticize it.  All the ones who look at it as just violence, and only that.  Chuck Palahinuk has written one of the best novels(which is also exceptionally good).  Pitt puts on the best performance of his career since 12 Monkeys.  Norton shows us that he is made out for people like ""Jack"" and ""Derek Vinyard""(American History X) and not people like ""father Brian Finn""(Keeping the Faith).It was a shame that this movie was so underrated, because it really shows great movie making, and it shows us reality(in a sense).  All put aside, this filming in this movie is beautiful, dark and suspenseful.  David Fincher has put out one of the best, a real movie that shows what everyone wants to be.  Fight Club IS what it is, it is not the Academy Awards, it isn't what you want it to be, it is what we are afraid to be.  Go see this movie.  ***** out of *****",1
"So simple, don't do like me and waste 2 years saying ""meh I'll watch it anothertime"" just watch it when you find it! You will enjoy it",1
"A quiet good movie and deserves to be in top.
I love this movie and all characters.",1
"Fantastic! Excelent! Great! Wotta movie! One of the best ever. It's absolutely unbelieveble, from the begining until the end. David Fincher proves again his extraordinary abbilities as a director (after he amazed the world with ""The game"" and ""Seven"") and realizes a real work of art. A perfect combination of thriller, dark comedy and psichological. David Fincher+Brad Pitt+Edward Norton--super! Brad Pitt shows everyone that he's not only appreciated because of his looks, but because he has a certain ammount of talent.And Edward Norton... what can I say? ""I am Jack's mountain of rage and anger"". If that wasn't an Oscar performance, then which is? He plaied fabulous, and if those people from the American Film Academy weren't that one-sided, taking in consideration only dramas or love-stories, and would take a short glance at another type of movies, like ""Fight Club"", Norton would have been admiring right this very moment a well deserved gold statue. The movie is too violent to have any other effect on critics but repulsion, but its real value cannot be judged. At least in my mind, the Oscar for a leading role sounds like this: ""The winner is... Edward Norton."" About the movie... only good things to say. It's absolutly delightful. The furniture needed by Edward's appartement, the explosion, the reason for people to fight, the horrible, unconscient laughter of Pitt, when he's beaten by the owner of the bar, the scenes between Edward and his boss, everything is made to perfection. I can't end this without saying something about Helena Carter, who completes the greatness of the movie, playing very good a tough and interesting role. And the ending... great!So, all of' ya, who wanna see this movie, GO SEE IT! All of' ya who don't wanna see this movie, GO SEE IT! All of' ya who saw this movie before, GO SEE IT!It would be the wisest choice ever.Grading: 11 (out of 10).Chris, Brasov, Romania.",1
Morgan Freeman great leading actor. Stephen King short story novella such a great non fiction.,1
This film was such an intriguing film. I think it was a 2 time watch for me to fully appreciate the whole film. On a first watch the excitement was high but a lot of question were required. Upon second watch i watch able to talk it trough with a brother making it easier to understand the full complexity of it all. Amazing Film and a great watch. Not a film to stick on to have a nap. i rated it nine out of ten as a ten must be a film that hits all element and i could have done with a bit more comedy. Nine is still a high standing rating. Brilliant acting and actors throughout. Love the action parts in the hallway bet it was fun to film.,1
"And so I returned to my fear of watching IMDb Top 10 films for the first time with ""Fight Club"", worried what I was going to think of it and afraid that I seemingly be the only person that didn't like it. By the end of the film, my fears were mostly quelled, but there was still a niggling feeling that something wasn't quite right. I couldn't immediately see what point ""Fight Club"" was trying to make, and for me it felt like it had mixed morals, but those are merely an afterthought in what is a stylish, humorous and very well acted movie.The unnamed narrator of the film is played by Edward Norton, and provides witty and nihilistic commentary throughout the film. His life is boring, he is an insomniac with mental health issues that go even deeper than that, and he needs to find some excitement. He starts going to support groups for the terminally ill just so that he can feel emotional outlet, a method that's also carried out by Helena Bonham Carter's character. It's a foul idea, but the film very nearly makes you able to see where they're coming from. On a flight one day, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and sees a man that is everything that he's ever wanted to be _ successful, exciting, daring, attractive, not stuck in a boring day-to-day job. The Narrator and Durden start spending more time together, and that's when things get crazy.Through the pair's setting up of a Fight Club, initially as a substitute for the support groups, but eventually as a training ground for their minions, we are subjected to a horrific amount of violence and animalism. The Narrator gets carried away, spurred on by Durden, and they embark on ""Project Mayhem"", an operation whose sole intention is to mess stuff up and 'destroy capitalism'. It is only after a sudden blackout from Norton's character that we are provided with our twist, a discovery that changes the entire meaning of the film, and the final half hour does an extremely good job of working out and justifying that.It's a film that is held up by its performances and styling. Norton and Pitt work off each other extremely well, with Norton's narration providing an interesting and witty commentary over the bleak events of the movie. In a film as dark as this, finding yourself laughing really does make you look at yourself. Bonham Carter is brilliant, yet severely underused, and her character could have been made so much more prominent to provide a bit more of the ""twisted moral compass"" that she seems to have. The film is shot through a darkened lens, which superbly captures the rainy, dingy and crumbling world that the characters inhabit.""Fight Club"" is a film with a message, shown by The Narrator's eventual rejection of Durden's ways and philosophy, but only just. He doesn't want to become like him, ruining everything and destroying things for the sake of it. The problem I have with the film is the way that it gets there _ in displaying the violent and anarchistic build up to its lead character's rejection of those ways, it glamourises it. The whole point of the film is that we too are taken in as followers of Tyler Durden and his ways, and I worry that, even though the actual Fight Club scenes are only a small part of the film, their extreme nature does more harm than good. It may not be advocating violence, but to people who don't quite absorb its message, it may seem like it does.Despite the hype and huge cult following of the film, it's not Fincher's best work. It has great set-pieces, performances and visuals, but the plot occasionally jumps around confusingly and the message has a tendency to feel muddled. It is worth watching and for the vast majority of the runtime really enjoyable, but perhaps my best advice would be not to read too deeply into it.",1
"An excellent Movie One of the best I've ever watched about two men who seek redemption from the institutionalization of the prison. They seek freedom yet like the place..It is about friendship,happiness,tears,.The Movie is about a banker on how he is sent to prison for his wife's murder and makes friends there He turns out to be very popular among the inmates. The film brilliantly narrates the life of prisoners who spend their lives decently. As it turns out that he is innocent He finally Plans and breaks out of the prison.The movie is beautifully written, directed,and the cherry on the top is Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.... The dialogue delivery..the expression .. the acting holds you during the entire movie...A must watch movie...",1
"OK so its good, but its not THAT good!!! OK so its over long, the hand to hand combat scenes are boring, the sonar scenario at the end is just plain ridiculous, and they completely wasted the character of Harvey Dent/Two Face. Why they insisted on squeezing the entire birth and death of Two Face into the final 45 minutes of the film ill never know, but it was definitely a waste. Heath's performance as the joker was simply amazing thats a fact, the car chase and interrogation scenes were very interesting and visually pleasing. Maggie gylenhahl is pretty lame as Rachel Dawes if u ask me and i wasn't sorry to see her get blown to kingdom come!!! So yer on the whole a good movie, but not deserving of the ""masterpeice"" label that is getting thrown at it by so many!!!",1
"Hope, endurance, and unconditional friendship are core themes of the film. Corruption, manipulation, and betrayal are also present, but they're shown to fail in the end. The problem of ""institutionalization"" is shown and discussed -- a prison inmate has spent so much time in prison, he has forgotten how to live outside the prison walls. Integrity and perseverance are major themes.",1
"I avoided this movie for a long time, assuming it to be just another Patrick Swayze-'Roadhouse'-type ""chick-flick"": you know, where a bunch of pretty boys with greased chests preen and posture, until the prettiest of them all finally wins the heart of the poor, threatened damsel.Could I possibly have been any more wrong?This is one of the finest examples of intelligent film-making I have ever seen, as well as the most compelling piece of storytelling I can think of.The cast shine brightly, especially Edward Norton, who turns in a near-flawless performance; and what a shock to discover that Brad Pitt *can* act, after-all!Visually beautiful, expertly crafted sound, with a splendid overall ambiance as a result.From a narrative perspective, the plot 'twist' is interesting, but I feel it is of lesser importance than the message which, paradoxically, should repel me the most - that the current generation of western men have been socially and emotionally emasculated by a cartel of too-powerful and domineering women, and unjust laws and privileges bestowed upon females by a society petrified of being branded Politically Incorrect.As a woman, I naturally and instinctively object to such ideas, but as an honest and intelligent person, not yet fully blinded by propaganda and femmo-Nazi mind-control methods, I have to regretfully concede some truth to it. Men ain't what they used to be.And whilst I don't miss the ""women as chattels"" mentality of days of yore, nor the old tendency of authority to turn a blind-eye to the likes of domestic abuse, I can't help but think of the words to a particularly apt song: ""Where Have All The Cowboys Gone""?'Fight Club' gives me some hope that perhaps, somewhere out there, men are thinking about being men again. As a woman, I welcome the concept.'Fight Club' should be viewed, not just as a superlative piece of film-making, nor as a brutal and bloody piece of entertainment, but as a clarion call to all people to discard the fear of the accountants and managers, and learn to be independent individuals once more.10 out of 10. Period.",1
"This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.",1
"http://mayurica.blogspot.com/2011/05/inception.htmlNolan likes to tempt & tease. He wants you to come back for more, again and again, until you've cracked it. And then, you can anoint him as the God of mind-f@#$ed stories. Just that, this time even though I'm tempted to re-enter his carefully constructed world of the layered dreams, I don't think I'm going to be wow-ed.No doubt, the concept intrigues. And engages. Makes you think. And before you know it, you're struggling between what's real and what's not. But it's not exactly a brand new idea. Matrix is probably the godfather of the real Vs virtual paradox. There have been other films too that have explored the idea of living in the mind, or in an alternate virtual environment. Tarsem's 'The Cell' & the obscure Jude Law/Jennifer Jason Leigh's 'eXistenZ come close. One of the scenes towards the end of the film made me wonder if this was Shutter Island all over again. Eternal sunshine is a genre apart, but somehow creeps in as well. But don't get me wrong - all these references take nothing away. On the contrary, they help you place Nolan's new world in context. And he tweaks it quite a bit. So, it's not set in the conscious mind, but in a maze of carefully-crafted dreams. Fueled by imagination, constructed by architects and controlled by a set of logic and laws that are as malleable & transient as the dreams themselves! Inception therefore lends itself to an extraordinary scale. And forges some unique action sequences that are here to stay! I loved the zero-G stunts, and almost every other thing with twisted physics. The scene where Page experiments with city architecture is absolutely fascinating. As the story progresses, you keep wanting to pick the director's brain. How on earth did he manage to construct such a coherent labyrinth of ideas and then weave them into intricate plots, without seeming contrived or predictable? all the while deftly leading his characters deeper and deeper through a vortex? And you can't help being sucked in. It's giddy. It's exhilarating. It screws your mind.So, what's my grouse? Nothing that's terribly important! Just that, somehow I feel Nolan didn't need a visual spectacle to keep me hooked to this story. Maybe, he wanted to scale up post the Batman movies. Maybe he felt that its the least his audiences expect of him. But for me, I would have been just as happy without the mega-military intrusions, and the spectacular avalanches. I would have been just as happy to skip the very Bourne-like Mombasa sojourn. Just as happy without the mega-adventure & action tag. Because if it's about the mind and the ideas, I'm happy being served word-play! The mission and its improbability intrigue me anyway. I don't need guns to steal or plant ideas, I'd rather watch thoughts steal thoughts, or thoughts plant thoughts. At the most, throw in some chases in mazes, and confound me with the surreal. Fox me with deep thought and the vivid imagination and the crazy physics. Like Di Caprio's mind that lives in a multi-storied apartment, set in the most splendid & decaying mega city by the sea. And honestly, that was more interesting. (Spoilers Ahead) Which perhaps explains why, the innermost dream and finale was reserved for Di Caprio quietly battling his demons. Or Fischer's final chat with his dad. The final scene was pure wicked! What I didn't get is a basic question - How is everyone in the same dream? And even, how did Di Caprio know that the Jap guy was in limbo? Though, I did like the idea of using Ellen Page's character for the audience's standpoint. If you're not sure what's happening, just wait for her to ask around! But the answers aren't that important. Chances are when I see it again, I'll probably find it. Because Nolan is one of the finest story-tellers of our time. Just that, he might have done a bit too much with this film.",1

Repetition in min 42 and 25 when Andy wants to ask red for a special delivery.Basically he uses the same line, and in real life, especially in a prison situation, that wouldn't have happened. ""I understand you're a man who can get things"" basically the same line Andy uses in both scenes and red responds also in the same way ...

"As far as action movies go, Dark Knight was as intense and good as action movies can get. The acting was superb- Ledger became the standard by which future movie villains will be judged. He was not the ""cartoon"" Joker, but a very creepy, almost Hannibal Lector-like character. My wife actually had a nightmare about him the night after we saw the movie. It was Ledger's performance that really cemented this as a great film, but also the reason for caution. Batman is based off a comic book and so Hollywood, though giving it a PG-13 rating should expect that kids will go because it is based on a comic book/cartoon character. I cannot emphasize strongly enough- DO NOT TAKE A CHILD TO THIS MOVIE!!! Ledger's brilliant intensity and profound evil made for a good villain...a very ADULT villain wholly unsuitable for kids. That coupled with the amount and intensity of brutal violence in this film...it shocks me that it only earned a PG-13. I cannot comprehend how it did not get an R rating. I do not say that as an insult to the film, just stating a fact. Truth is, it was a brilliantly done action film....FOR ADULTS. Batman was high octane and fast paced....quickest 2.5 hours I ever spent. Thoroughly enjoyed it, just keep the kiddies away from this one.",1
"Solid, enjoyable, kinetic...Thumbs up to all involved...Won't give anything away...Just sat in a preview screening, and walked on the streets of Gotham.Obviously much debate now will be about whether all the buzz about Heath Ledger's performance, is due to sympathy, or a truly demented performance. I strongly believe, and argue for, the latter...In two words, ""Heath Legend"". The Joker was already an iconic role, so there was always going to be attention and close scrutiny (never mind having to step out of, or rather further into, Jack Nicholson's shadow), the man from Down Under doesn't disappoint.Though the stage does not belong to one man alone; let's not forget Batman (Bale, solid work Jedi). Gary Oldman's Gary GOLDman as usual. I believe in Harvey Dent.Thumbs up to everyone. From Nolan right down to the P.A.'s sweeping the floors, I stayed right through the credits out of respect, and pure cinematic marination...",1
I just cannot get over the amazing sound in this film. I like to watch this and analyze every little detail and how the music actually helps the story along. Music is powerful and this movie really uses music to its fullest potential. To work through every scene and enhance each scene with sound and music is key I think to this movie. Watching in silence it still is great. With the sound muted you get a different sense to the movie. I tried it both ways and each way the movie is still fun to watch. If you like a movie that makes you think and question everything then this is a great one to watch. Watch and discuss this movie with friends! It is a blast!!!,1
"One of the finest movies you will ever see!GodfatherII was my previous best but now i have to acknowledge that shawshank was unique and prolific in its own way.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver an outstanding performance and one has to say did a real justice to their roles.This movie is about hope, and time.Time you need to do things you wanna do,and time you need you to plan those things you wanna do.You will find an immensely deep character of Andy dufresne and you will have to wait till end to find out the height of his intellect,his vision and above all his hope.Really a must see movie for those who think hope is a dangerous thing!!",1

I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.",1
"I think the reason this film stands out a classic is because it has so much heart. I've always thought the story is what makes a great movie, and this one had a brilliant one, based on the short ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. The screenplay adaptation of this short novel elevates the dialog and the moving performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman into a masterpiece. The plot twists and turns in directions that defy the best of imaginations...ones that only Stephen King could write. I am truly humbled by the writing. But as a film it is more than that. It's over-riding theme of ""hope"" transcends the message over the walls of Shawshank to the green grass, and the beaches of Zihuatanejo.",1
LOVED this movie -- The Joker being my favorite villian. So ready for the 'Joker' movie about to come out!!,1
"I saw this film before ""The Sixth Sense"" and I have to say that in the spirit of ""Fight Club"" I came out of the cinema truly understanding the film's tagline of ""You do not talk about Fight Club"".  I spent the evening I came out from the cinema phoning everyone I knew cheering  that it was an excellent and truly enthralling movie - but then what?  Well, they all wanted to know what it was about; and of course I could say absolutely nothing because the more I thought about how to describe it and the plotline the less sense I could make of it and the more clearly its twists and turns became integral to any description.For anyone out there who has not yet succumbed to the delights of this movie, I'd hate to spoil their fun.  But trust me, Norton and Pitt turn in applause-worthy performances; the script is taut and funny; and Meatloaf actually makes you believe he can act.  It's a dark comment on these dark times and well worth the ride.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption - 1994""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of the things, and no good thing ever dies"", that's what The Shawshank Redemption sums up, but wait! that's, not the only theme it has, let's look over what Director-Writer Frank Darabont offered , based on a 1982 novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King.The story commences with a theme of murder mystery, which leads a banker, Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ), to go to life imprisonment against the charges of murder of his wife and her lover. And as the viewers expecting a murder mystery to be solved, there comes a new theme and a new character in the jail, Red (Freeman). The story now starts taking the picture of friendship faith and hope and shows a different life of prisoners and their emotions toward each other and towards the world, which leads to the friendship of Andy and Red. No spoilers, and after few incidents and a journey of affections and friendship amongst the prisoners, comes the moment of the uprising and, Boom! , the climax turns out to be the eye-opener and viewers for sure will think that, oh yea! That's what the name of the movie is! Correct! But after all that, we again see a little change and the conclusion of the story which is far away from hate and crime and will leave the viewers in a heart-melting situation.
We see the movie through the narration in the background by Red (Freeman), which turned out to be a path for viewers to easily go on. If we look at some technical aspects, we see a great work of lighting and camera, creating some intense scenes in jail locker and an amazing climax scene.Different journeys within a journey, unexpected twist and turns from the very beginning till the end, hats off to the performances, writing and unexpectedly brilliant Direction, making ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a trendsetter.",1
"Wow!!! Great plot. This movie won't get old for generations. It deserves No.1 every year... Lots of movies releasing all over the world based on prison break, but none of them can beat masterpieces like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Great Escape"". When ""Warden Norton""(Bob Gunton) tries to open Bible, Andy Dufresne handles the situation. This scene rolls again in all our mind, like mind blowing in the climax. Of course it's disappointing that other master-pieces like pulp_fiction and forest gump released in same year which made ""The Shawshank Redemption"" ended up with no Oscar's. What an extraordinary plot! This never gets old.",1
I like this movie. I watched it four or five times. I would recommend everyone to watch it.,1
If you're looking for hope in this world then you must watch this movie ? ?. This movie deserves to be one of the best movies of all time with no doubt and it has a very deep meaning other than the story it self is magnificent and that is obvious cause it's written by STEPHEN KING. Just enjoy,1
"""Inception"" (Legendary/ Warner, 2010) is a fictional film/psychological thriller, which also encompasses the theme of Heist, and which was nominated for several awards at the time of release, being written and directed by one of my favorite directors, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Dunkirk, Dark Knight, Interstellar, Insomnia). The story is about a mercenary (Don Cobb - who have a traumatic past) and his team who designs and extracts secrets from the subconscious of people during the team-created dreams, infiltrating themselves through a device and sedation. In a last job offered, the mission will be different - implanting an idea in the head of an heir of a gigantic company, and it will not be easy this time.The script develops within Nolan's complex style, which require a little more than just watching the film, but rather to understand it, having several background details that are revealed as the film passes, and with a plot that evolves to the end with an upward curve in the action and drama within the film. The events and mystery in the tragedy of the protagonist life has a fundamental role and even echoes in the very end of the film, in the last scene. The film was highly acclaimed and awarded at the time, including an Oscar for cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing and visual effects, and was also nominated for best picture, screenplay (both went to The King's Speech in the Oscar s edition), art direction and original musical score.The cinematography has a Noir style, performed by Wally Pfister (who has worked with Nolan on other films such as Dark Knight, Prestige, Insomnia), an ultra-talented professional, who uses perfect angles in the scenes and sequences, with a good use of shades differentials in every situation and dream sequences. Each one have it own style, and in one of the sequences that takes place within a layered dream, the environment ends up spinning within reality, and being a cinematographer adept of naturalism (i.e. what one can do without effects in CG, he tries to do, which gives an additional emphasis on the quality of the production) the team used the same technique Kubrick used to simulate the zero gravity sequences in a 2001: A Space Odyssey. The locations were filmed in various locations, such as Morocco, NY, England, France and Los Angeles and were filmed in 35mmm anamorphic format (which expands the field of view and captures things that would be outside the angle of normal view) and also in 65mm in key sequences.Lora Hirschberg's award-winning sound effects and visuals by Chris Corbould, Andrew Lockley, Pete Bebb are also perfect and impress and immerse people in the film. The music track is by Hans Zimmer (Interstellar, Lion King, Gladiator), who doesn't even need to comments on the references to his excellent work. In the cast, also outstanding, Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Looper), Ellen Page (Juno, X-Men, Umbrella Academy), Marion Cotillard and Ken Watanabe (Last Samurai, Godzilla).The movie is for me another milestone on the cinema, being smart, with top-notch photography, music, effects and sequences allied to a great background story with very good performances. It is for sure a classic to all those who like intelligent fiction movies.",1
"Times have passed. Is now eleven years ago i saw this movie for the first time. And i have to say this is still the best movie i have ever seen. The acting, the picture, the mood. It´s so dark, i love it. I have watched it over ten times and is is still as good as the first time i saw it.",1
"Maybe it's silly but sometime when I face a tough situation in my life and I feel powerless and hopeless; I remember how Andy dug a tunnel with his rock hammer for 19 years, 19 YEARS.. to gain his freedom.
For me it's simple. This movie gives me hope.",1
"I won't deny, I went to see this today with expectations of it being a great movie. The Batman series has generally been great and this one promised to be so with a fabulous cast. My expectations were blown away, this was an incredible movie. Hands down, my favorite Batman movie and within my top ten favorites of all times. Heath Ledger gave me chills as Joker, I never even thought about that I was watching him, I was merely watching Joker as never seen before. He's the ultimate in villains and will leave you thinking about the pencil trick for a while to come ;). The rest of the cast did excellent too though Joker really did steal the scenes. He's memorizing and terrifying all in one. The movie itself was unreal it was so intense. You had no idea what the next turn was and it had you on the edge of your seat in anticipation. The stunts pulled were incredible and just the whole thing had me reeling. It was far better than I had expected and not just because Heath portrayed an amazing Joker. The whole package was well worth seeing in the theater and I will be adding this to my collection as soon as it comes out. Perhaps even snagging a few as Christmas presents for the family because this movie should be seen by all.",1
"One of the best superhero movies I've ever seen and the best DC movie I've seen.Its a really good film and it gave me a couple frights the first time I watched it ,great action and Heath Ledger does an exceptionally good job at playing the Joker. Heath has done a way better job then any other portrayer.",1
I love this movie so much this movie is the best .i love the actor especially morgan freeman,1
"Unbelievable thinking of Chrishtopher Nolan. I've ever seen before. Need some reference to understand this movie fully. Still i could not understand some part of this movie. Need to watch once again. Overall very great movie. This is the very tough screen play in world cinema history. Also Excellent performance by DiCaprio. This year DiCaprio stands with his acting (Shutter Island). Movie rocks in all the area (BGM,Actor's Performance,etc) . This is very great, nowadays people understanding these type of movies really. Inception : Dream in the Dream in the Dream in the Dream in the Dream. It never ends, Because you are in endless sleep in 3rd level of dream.",1
Its amazing if u watch this u will predict this film,1
"One of the most excitng movies that have too many elements to force you watch it for X times, I personally watch this movie in a 6-10 month cycle over and over again and everytime you sit there and make your eyes focus on how brad bitt acting his role, you get disappointed how you are whimpering about your life.",1
"..voice of total respect for this movie.Everything is absolutely fantastic in this master piece. Casting, acting, photography, music, sounds, feel, atmosphere, screenplay, all that is beyond good, it is perfect. Whole movie is immersed in such a delight it really helps if you are feeling down to lift you up. And that is what movies should be all about. Not about damn effects and 3d. As many said before it really lift your spirits up. It gives such a profound feel of hope and happiness, and beyond. And there is another great value of this movie. It proves that sometimes in this lifetime Hollywood is capable to create master piece. It is one but that one speaks for thousands of those we do not get to see. No effects, no damn computer graphics, no faster then light action scenes, and yet after watching it you feel million times better than any other movie.It deserves 11 stars.",1
Wonderful cast. Impecable acting by morgan freeman c.Right from the begining movie picks its pace.There's no moment without thrill while watching this masterpiece.,1
"Ii have never truly been a fan of the batman origins or batman comics, animated movie and shows, and pretty much Batman himself. My father is a Batman fan girl and I sit in my room listening to it all the time. A few days ago I sat there and watched it with him cause I had nothing better to do. I watch three minutes of the movie and I love it, tuning out everything else. My favorite character was the Joker. Heath got so into it, that I though he was actually a psychopathic murderer. He truly conveyed the story line.",1
"""This review includes a few minor spoilers"" I have to admit that I started to loose faith in comic adaptations, recently. After Spider-Man 3 and the slightly better Superman Returns, I kinda lost interest in those two heroes and I began to focus my attention on Batman. Batman is a very interesting person, since his alter ego Bruce Wayne is pretty well known person, a billionaire, who has developed a dark side over the years, mainly due to the murder of his parents.When I saw Batman and Robin many years ago, I thought that this was the end of Batman. The whole movie was just terribly weak and even the strong cast couldn't carry the movie, making Batman and Robin a very dark spot in the Batman franchise. I suggest you watch it though, because it will make you appreciate Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.Batman Begins strongly rebooted the series. The Direction, the cast, the story; everything just fit together perfectly and it make me look forward to a sequel.Now, I read many of the reviews and they were all very enthusiastic. I was surprised, because I expected to see a great movie, but not a movie that would even make Roger Ebert give it a 4/4. But now, after having seen the movie, I'm totally speechless. This is definitely one of the best, if not THE BEST, movie of the decade.The acting really made out a huge part of this movies greatness. Christian Bale portrays Wayne in an excellent way, making you feel his pain and anger and shows more than ever that he was the best choice for the role. Aaaron Eckart was great too, playing Harvey Dent and Two-Face very convincing. I haven't seen too many of his movies yet, definitely a mistake. He can play the good, almost flawless Harvey Dent and at the same time completely get into the role of an evil person, consumed by anger and revenge. His situation is not even that different from Batman's, but he chooses the wrong way of dealing with it. In fact, all of the actors showed a great performance: Maggie Gyllenhall (who tries to forget her love for Bruce), Michael Cane (whose performances are rarely below great), Morgan Freeman (same as Michael Cane) and Gary Oldman (who seems to get better and better with the movies he makes.And then of course, Heath Ledger, whose performance redefines the term pure awesomeness. There is no one, absolutely no one (including Jack Nicholson) who could have done a better job with this role. He manages to show the Joker as a terribly evil and heartless monster but at the same time also manages to gain the most laughs of the audience, with his appearance, voice and dialogue. It shows what a great actor Heath Ledger really was and this is by far his best performance (sorry, Brokeback Mountain fans). He plays his role completely flawless and more than deserves an Oscar for his performance, a performance that will be hard to top in years to come. It's sad that he won't have a chance to continue his career, which began so promising and ended way too early.But it's not only the actors that make this movie so good. Christopher Nolan already did an excellent job with Batman Begins but The Dark Knight tops Batman Begins in every aspect, including the script. There is not a single thing that could have been solved better and there were many psychological surprises and twists, no one would have expected.It's too bad I don't have an IMAX theatre close to me, because the visual effects and action were already great in a normal Cinema. In an Imax theatre, they must be spectacular.In conclusion I have to say, that this movie regenerated my faith in comic adaptations. It was a long time ago that a movie surprised me like Dark Knight, and many years will pass until it happens again. Until then, this movie stands on top of my long list of movie favorites. Long live the Batman!!!",1
This is the best movie that i have ever look. it goes cool with a lots of story,1
This movie is so amazing to view and graphics are so nice.,1
"Fight Club is a cool movie about -as its name says- Fight Club! It has loads of nice fighting sequences and the plot is incredible! The Fight Club really ""suck you in"" and wont let you go until you´ve seen it and after you´ve seen it, you want to see it again. YEAH! Its not just a movie, its also beautiful art of fighting and secrets of human mind!",1
"2008's ""The Dark Knight"" is deserving of its praise both at the time of its release and retrospectively; there isn't much I can contribute that hasn't already been analyzed. The movie's profound modernization and brutal depiction of what a superhero movie can be is incredible. And most paramount to mind, Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker is uniquely unforgettable and will endure the passage of time to be revered as one of, if not the greatest live-action Joker performance.No movie is perfect to everyone though, and I believe in contrast to 1989's ""Batman"" for example, Gotham City of ""The Dark Knight"" lacks an attempt of imaginative aesthetic of the previous. 1989's ""Batman"" used methods such as constructed sets, miniatures, matte paintings, etc., that enhanced mystique and audience escapism to the fictional Gotham City, not limited to environments and architecture that exist in our world. ""The Dark Knight"" featuring the latter, has a diluted visual appeal in that regard. But that's just a personal preference of style; to each their own. It doesn't break the movie.One final criticism I have, and it's something that I believe really does damage the movie to a degree - Christian Bale's Batman voice sounds like every morning before shooting, he ate gravel as his breakfast cereal and it tore his throat to shreds. It's almost laughable and cringe inducing; such a bizarre choice, and no one among the crew opposed it? Wow. It nearly dissolves the emotional/dramatic impact of every scene Batman is in, and because gosh, it's the MAIN CHARACTER, it's unavoidable and it's near crippling. Bale's performance is bat guano, and Bale is definitely not my favourite Batman portrayal.Despite those two elements mentioned, don't assume my overall opinion wrong, ""The Dark Knight"" is incredible. It's still one of my favourite movies of the superhero genre typing this review in 2020. I just would never claim any movie as perfection. Do yourself a favour if you haven't watched ""The Dark Knight"" already, and to quote Joker, ""Let's put a smile on that face.""",1
"Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight. Absolutely fantastic movies (despite Memento's overlook in many cases). Christopher Nolan manages to deliver the same twisting adventure present in his previous movies in Inception. This movie, however, takes things to a whole new level. Inception is monumental. It is the epitome of cinematic creativity and revels in epic storytelling.Be warned: this movie is not for the middle school (or in most cases even high school) movie goer looking for cheap laughs, low budget blow up scenes, corny nudity or a dark theater to make out in.This movie REQUIRES thinking; it REQUIRES attention.When you dedicate yourself to its mastery, it can change your perceptions about life in a very big way.I would liken this movie to a sort of combination between Shutter Island, Memento and the Matrix. The cinematic elements are excellent, the music is inspiring and beautiful, the scenes are flawlessly directed, the actors are phenomenal, the writing is on point without unnecessary fluff, the plot is complicated but inspired, the movie flows with grace, and while some moments can be a bit slow, it's for a reason.The plot is very much about layers of action and detail. I would recommend getting your treats and bathroom breaks done ahead of time- if you miss a few minutes, trust me, those minutes are important, and you'll miss something.I don't want to give anything away, because the movie should really unfold before you (that's what creates it's power). Besides, you can read the synopsis up top by the title information.But I will say this:This movie could win an Oscar and change Hollywood. Period.",1
"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.",1
"The next time Hollywood powers that be want to dumb down a movie, I hope they take a look at INCEPTION first.At the end of the screening I attended, with a packed theater, on a Monday night no less, there was not only applause, but shouting of yahoos! The audience was a cross section from a few kids, to 20 somethings to 60 somethings! This is absolute proof that audiences are capable of keeping track of a fast paced, complicated story with subplots. Of course some of the time, you just had to just had to give yourself over to the experience. Probably Leonardo DiCaprio's best work since Titanic and that includes Shutter Island.Outstanding production values, including cinematography.Great casting and good career move for Ellen Page. She's definitely raised her status another several notches. I just have to say hot d**n Chris Nolan. Hope you're working on the next one already I'll be seeing this one again in the theater.",1
"As long as a movie has good acting, writing, and direction it has the potential to be great. Dark Knight has all three, in spades. In acting we've got a fair line up of leading men and a dream supporting group. Gary Oldman the most consistent of fine actors among the group, reprises his role admirably. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine has shown us nearly all of their tricks (granted they had quite a few throughout their ridiculously long careers) so there performances were merely comfort zone for the audience to recognizable and accept what they have to say as important. They did absolutely nothing special. Maggie Gyllenhaal equally did nothing special. She held her own put out a completely expected performance. Its nice to see Eric Roberts again, and he truly tried to add dimensions to a dimensionless character, he actually would have made a very fine Joker (granted nothing compared to Heath) during the eighties/early nineties when he was in his prime and hadn't been stained by so many B-movie disasters. Ritchie Coaster's macho dog loving mobster was fun. All the other minor characters excelled under Chris Nolan's direction, who instantaneously introduced us to seemingly three-dimensional human beings.As far as our leading three. Christian Bale had a lot more range to play in Batman Begins. In this movie it seemed very old hat already. Bale works best the more estranged his character is to both the other characters in the story and the audience. And we all accept him as Batman and Bruce Wayne, so there was no surprise in Bale method magic. Aaron Eckhart was as bland as usual. He played all the beats needed for the character and hit all the high points but was completely uninteresting. He looked perfect as Harvey Dent though. The fact of everyone else being so mundane actually improved the movie however, because it allowed Heath Ledger's performance become all the more striking. Ledger never over shadowed his other actors, he just dominated them and the scenes, as the character should have. He took one important line and transfixed it through his entire performance. He mentioned being a dog chasing cars, and the dog aspect is rooted through the entire performance. In any other context or character Ledger's performance would be considered inconsistent, although playing a primarily inconsistent character, makes his portrayal of the Joker, flawless. The Writing... truly strong. Situationally very Nolan esc. with is common twists and turns. And the dialogue for the Joker was intensely strong... everyone else above average. The writing translated very well into Nolan direction. He kept a two and half hour movie moving. Almost to the point of annoyance on a repeat viewing. I wanted time to relish in a scene, which was never delivered. That's merely taste however, it makes for iconic moments instead of iconic scenes.Other then that minor difference of opinion, my only true complaint. Is the terrible... terrible... terrible action choreography. Ever fight was Batman punching, elbowing, or forearming someone. Bad. Epic failure on the part of the action. Chase scenes? Great. However because I consider this movie a drama as apposed to a ""Super Hero"" movie. It still holds and A rating and a 10/10 (in percents... more like a 95)If you liked Dark Knight watch:Batman Batman Begins Fight Club Seven Heat (Nolan's sighting not mine)BRANDON C. LAY",1
Awesome character backgrounds. Each character has it's own story and we are able to identify each one of them and what happen around them easily. They live their lives separtly but,1
"I loved this movie!!! It succeeded in mushing up the difference between imaginary and truth. The characters have unreal connections and interactions which cause you to go ""huh!?!"" before the movie is over. The fantastical backdrops, out-there characters, and hard-edged music make it impossible to take your eyes off the screen. And I promise, you will be repeating the dialogue for days. Watch this film, you won't be disappointed. I give it a 9/10! Remember, don't become a slave to the Ikea catalogue.",1
"Surely this is the best part from the batman triology . Script , story , cast and crew everything is near to perfection, hats of to nolan to pull off such a great piece of art may be this would be the first movie to get oscar after the death of an actor.

"Writer-director Christopher Nolan explores the realm of dreams in Inception, his first film since his acclaimed box office juggernaut The Dark Knight. The sci-fi thriller's premise sounds simple enough, but its execution by Nolan is anything but. Ostensibly an international heist caper, Inception follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), an ""extractor"" whose form of corporate espionage is to invade the dreams of the rich and powerful and pluck their most tightly guarded secrets from the depths of their subconscious. ""A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules,"" Cobb says at one point.Cobb is an international fugitive due to a dark deed from his past that prevents him from being able to return state side to see his children. A shady corporate titan, Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe), offers Cobb a chance to wipe his past clean and go home. The job? Inception -- planting an idea into a mark's subconscious rather than stealing one. Saito wants Cobb and his longtime point man, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to invade the dreams of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the heir to an energy conglomerate who is also riddled with daddy issues. Saito wants to take out the competition so to speak.",1
"The Plot: Bruce Wayne Batman (Christian Bale) is defending Gotham as it's defender of the night. Now he is dealing with a truly insane enemy ""The Joker"" (Heath Ledger). Now Bruce finally seeking a new hero to take over his job, someone that Gotham can look up to instead of ""Batman"" a man in a mask, this person is Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). But the Joker has other means in mind his master plan of insanity pursues.My Spiel: I can't say enough good things about this movie from a 2 hours and 30 minute movie. The Dark Knight was so great because it was basically watching 2 movies. Which is exactly what you hope to see to get your full entertainment purposes and money's worth. Like I heard from someone this movie isn't a superhero movie, but It's just a tremendously excellent top notch movie which happens to have superheroes in it. But let me frown on that for a second, because none of the villains in this nor the main hero have any super powers, they just have the access to be truly sinister and be beneficial to whatever it is that they do in this movie. That being said Bruce Wayne is a Billionaire and can pretty much buy any thing known to man to help him defend the streets of the corrupt Gotham underground. I am a truly big fan of the first ""Batman Begins"" and was so shocked when I first saw it. I said to myself when I was going to see it, ""No way they will get that tank to work well"" but I was absolutely wrong, and it really made Batman truly a bad ass to be reckoned with, because how many times would you like an all terrain fast tank to be your personal vehicle. That being said This movie is a must see for anyone granted it is #1 on IMDb.com (one of the biggest movie sites to date). Which I am truly happy to see it there because this movie had it all, with it's spectacular fighting scenes, and its new concepts and story line putting light years ahead of other movies. Granted the movie was long and I made a quote to myself as I'm watching it, ""Man I could watch this movie again"" and then a hour later the movie is still going and I then finished my quote ""Man I could watch this movie again....Tomorrow!"" But not that it bothered me that it was long it was truly a masterpiece and deserves all the hype because this is the best comic movie to date obviously! I was so thrilled with ""Batman Begins"" I thought that was the best comic movie I would see, but what you need to know The Dark Knight is so good because of the ground work that was put in from the first movie ""Batman Begins"". Granted this movie will break so many money records it will be phenomenal, then again this movie got some help from the crazy/accidental death of its master villain Heath Ledger as ""the Joker."" Which is a huge knock out blow to any hopes of duplicating a masterful sinister villain for another Batman installment. But not once did I shake my head and go that is completely ridicules, well that's not completely true the part with Wayne putting those emitters in all the phones in all of Gotham! From that aside is amazing work for the Director Christopher Nolan to accomplish in my eyes. I am so stoked and can't wait to get this on DVD to watch it again and again. If this movie doesn't get nominated for any awards it will just answer the questions we already knew, that the Oscars are a complete joke and all politics. If you don't ever see The Dark Knight you are missing a epic depiction of sacrifice for the greatest good.The Dark Knight (2008) Review: 9/10",1
The best villain ever in the cinema history. Exciting,1
"There are good books and good movies and does not depend of the source material In the eternal struggle between which is better if the book or the movie?, this is a point for films. The interpretation of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins manages to be more endearing than the novel, based on the short story "" Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" of Stephen King, all that adds the film improvement history in every sense and pulls out completely unnecessary sexual details that are common in King's stories(Apt Pupil, It and more) This is a movie that portrays freedom as any ever and definitively one of the best films of all time Is't a pity that came out the same year as Braveheart and some of the Oscars",1
A pretty good film this is exactly wat I've been looking for in a movie.,1
"Truly a masterpiece of cinema.  I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by.  Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film.  How did it not win oscars galore.  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story.  A love of hope, a love of friendship and a love of life, no matter the constraints.  I LOVE THIS FILM!",1
"This summer I was disappointed seeing the Indiana Jones sequel (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) - to me just recycled bits and pieces from Raiders.The Dark Knight is one of the best I have seen this year - and Sir Michael Caine was spot-on saying that Heath Ledger's final performance as the Joker - one really saw a psychopath and not a mischievous clown in this character.I thought Christian Bale's performance was spectacular - and although Michael Caine - one of my favorite actors - had but a few lines they were great. Which goes to the saying that ""There are no small parts; only small actors"".""Blockbusters"" usually have tons of hype with mediocre execution; this was an exception. I'll bet since Jaws maybe 10 -less than 10 - in 30+ years have kept the audience riveted with the plot and acting - this is one addition.",1
"It's been 15 years since I watched this movie for the first time. Back then, in my youth, several aspects of this movie made me think a lot: the value of true friendship, the injustices in life, the importance of not giving up on your dreams and, the most powerful of all, always have hope and make your thoughts and actions rely on that hope. I also remember thinking that, while some characters got what they deserved, others were wronged in a way that annoyed me too much. That was the reason that I liked but not loved this movie in the first time.After that first time, I watched this movie at least another five times. Today, 15 years later, I can say that the injustices in the movie are not only bearable but also completely necessary. This is the real magic about this movie: you can find good in murderers, evil in wardens, friendship in a deceitful place, justice in injustices and hope in despair. Those ingredients are responsible for making this story so believable. This movie is capable of captivating the viewer through the natural bond created with the protagonist, in such way that, in the end, when everything went to despair, the viewer learns that hope is the only thing that anyone should not abandon. Yes, this movie is a true masterpiece.",1
"Great movie for family watching or watching with friends.
One of my favorite movies. 10/10",1
It is a genius dramatic action work ..i have enjoyed it to high level degree . it is one of the best movies in the history .,1
"Ever since he spun the ""Batman"" franchise on its head half a decade ago, there's been an increasingly significant level of quality expected from writer/director Christopher Nolan. If his latest creation is any indication, Nolan sure knows how to execute a brilliant idea even when under the most intense of pressure. His latest affair, the mind-bending ""Inception,"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who extracts thoughts and ideas from people by entering their dreams. When a job goes wrong, he is offered a chance at redemption. This time he has to introduce an idea into the mind of a subject rather than steal it away. It's an easy enough task, right? Wrong. As he soon finds out, plunging into the depths of uncharted waters is especially tricky when carrying your own personal baggage. To quote Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Total Recall"": ""It's the best mind**** yet!"" ""Inception"" boasts an impressive cast. DiCaprio aside, we are treated to some of the finest young talent Hollywood has to offer by way of Ellen Page, Cilian Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The actors _ while excellent in their roles _ are but a pawn in Nolan's game. Fact of the matter is he could have cast a group of no-names and the film would still be as great as it is. The true star of the film is not only the insanely well-crafted script which will have you second-guessing yourself at every turn, but the stunning visuals that accompany it. Watching this movie is like stepping into an alternate universe where anything you could imagine is possible. Nolan asks us to suspend disbelief as we follow the film's characters through layers of dreams. Because the script is water-tight and the visuals so flawless, we are fooled easily enough. Like children, we believe whole-heartedly in what we see unfold before us even if we aren't quite sure of how it all works.While Nolan has had a pretty consistent track-record thus far, it still comes as a shock that ""Inception"" is as good as it is. The term is thrown around loosely all too often, but the film is a heavy contender for best film of the year. More than that, though, this is Nolan's masterpiece. The director's perfectionist streak shows through in a film that truly has no flaws. It may take a few viewings to completely wrap your head around, but there is not an inch of celluloid wasted. There is not a line uttered without importance and not a special effect that looks artificial. To step into the world of ""Inception"" is to step into another dimension where films can still be magical and blow the minds of even the most jaded of movie-goers. A dream come true indeed.Oh, and was I the only one expecting to hear Tom Petty's ""Free Fallin'"" during the scenes where the van falls off the bridge? I hope not.",1
"!!! beautiful and excellent !!! I rated to this film 10 because this is new subject for me and eye-catching :) this is necessary to after watch the film , read the review and understand what happen in the film :) the music in the film is very good and perfectly match to movie as frozen we until finish credit :)",1
"I was recommended to watch Shawshank Redemption by my college accounts teacher. According to him this was the best movie he had seen in his lifetime. After I saw it, trust me nothing came anywhere near to the level on which Shawshank Redemption is! Once you start watching it, it takes you in so subtly that you won't even know and you're deep in the movie, and till the final curtains fall, no matter how important it is, but you just can't leave that screen! The way the story progresses on a path, you better get your popcorn ready before hitting that 'play' button. From the starting of the film it grips you, based on utter reality from the 90's, the way an innocent man gets sentenced for murder and is sent in jail with inmates as close to inhumane as they can be. In the wild world inside the jail, only Morgan Freeman is someone he can talk to and trust on. And so begins his quest to get free from this prison. From doing errands for cigarettes, to escaping inmates trying to rape you, he finally finds his way out! And the way he does that is what steals all the attention! Brilliance! You can't afford to miss out this movie, go get it today and leave a review.Shawshank Redemption is and will always be the BEST that ever came out of Hollywood!A MUST WATCH RECOMMENDATION TO EVERYONE!",1
"The Fight Club is probably one of the greatest movie ever created that combines so many Genres and made a masterpiece. This movie is about a guy that narrates his life story through out the movie. What makes it interesting is while he is narrating he doesn't realize his illusions and just narrates what he thinks is real. The movie starts out with a sad entrance and kind of dramatic about an average American person with a job that makes good money and in the process he discovers his Brutal side. Now, what made him violent is that he met a guy on a plane who he admired and happened to turn out to be his friend after he found out his apartment was on fire and he needed a place to crash. His friend made opened his eyes about how his life is boring and needs to change. They start by fighting and than starting a fight club. So far, the movie is just dramatic, sad, and brutal. Than, in the end it just becomes romantic, sad, dramatic, and breathtaking! One of the greatest and popular movies ever created.",1
"Fight club is a dark, fast-moving movie that audiences don't have much time to contemplate, but unlike other films of its kind, each of David fincher's quick cuts has a unique function, besides keeping the audience from getting bored. The most thrilling thing about the whole movie is not what the movie is about, but how David fincher pushes the audience into the mind of the narrator ""me"", forcing the audience to feel ""me"" in the scene. It also opens up another possibility for storytelling in the film industry.",1
"The film unfolds self-examination and thinking from the perspective of exploring humanity and the era of the current social material desire overflowing with a lack of spirit. Putting aside the constraints of reality, longing for an anarchic life, venting to do things that are in harmony with the flesh, does not violate your own wishes, and is no longer bound by real life. Finally found that life is a nothingness, the real world is only the imagination, death is not necessarily more painful than living, just a different way of existence. How valuable it is to return to reality, cherish the moment, because the time to live is much shorter than death after all!",1
"What is there to say about The Shawshank Redemption? Clearly there is a reason for it's widespread popularity, and thankfully that praise is warranted. While far from the best film I've ever seen (it currently holds the #1 spot on IMDb), I can't argue against it being a great film. In particular, the performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are inspiring enough to power the film through it's slower passages. The cinematography has been praised for good reason as well, a lot of thought was obviously put into every shot to convey a certain feeling or message. Although I found the story arc to be somewhat predictable, the art of storytelling is the real star here, guiding us through themes that are masterfully simple on the surface, but have a lot going on underneath for you to think about later on. Really the only thing that held this film back for me is it's reliance on some rather cliché (at least at this point in time) plot developments amidst it's middle act. Being objective though, it's hard to tell whether that is the fault of the way it was crafted, or just the result of the film being so broad in it's scope. Either way, it stands the test of time as a film very much worth viewing. Maybe we have been looking at Shawshank all wrong. Maybe it's not so amazing because of how many people think it's great, maybe it's because of how few people there are that don't. It certainly has a message that everyone can appreciate.",1
"PLOT: Picking up where 'Batman Begins' left off, Batman (Christian Bale) and James Gordon (Gary Oldman) join forces with Gotham's new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), dubbed ""The White Knight"" by the press, to dismantle the remaining mob bosses in Gotham. But there's a new player in the game, a sadistic criminal called the Joker (the late Heath Ledger), and he's hellbent on destroying everyone and everything in his path, in one way or another.To put it simply, this is a powerful, moving film far beyond any previous comic book adaptations. The film truly is nothing short of superb. The late Heath Ledger was undeniably creepy & terrifying as the hateful, heartless, lip-licking, cackling Joker (and trust me, he does a great job of making you hate the Joker), while Aaron Eckhart delivers a powerful performance as the doomed DA Harvey Dent/2-Face, so powerful it makes me wish Eckhart was the one up for an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale is of course perfect as Batman/Bruce Wayne with the always welcomed Gary Oldman, Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman reprising their roles as Gordon, Alfred & Fox. Maggie Gyllenhaal lends nice support in the Rachel Dawes role originated by Katie Holmes (who is sadly better known now as Mrs. Tom Cruise #3).Can't wait for the next one... and it had better have Catwoman/Selina Kyle in it.",1
"I have recently watched it again on Blu-ray with HDR master. It's truly breath taking, from brilliant visuals, unforgettable soundtrack to the groundbreaking set-pieces its an experience to witness.",1
"This review will be on the movie The Shawshank RedemptionBackground information:Genres: Drama, and Crime Fiction.Directed by Frank DarabontAcademy Awards: One of the Best movies of all time nominated for Oscars but never wonMain Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, James Whitmore, and Clancy BrownReleased: 1994Plot: Andy Dufresne is an innocent man sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover. While in prison he forms a friendship with Red, experiences brutality of prison life, all in 19 years.Acting 9/10: Everyone did well acting but Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman really carried the movie. I especially enjoyed the narration in this movie by Morgan Freeman. Tim Robbins probably had a better performance in this movie over any other movie he has been in. I did really enjoy the chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Especially the ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" scene.Overall Rating: 10/10Would I recommend it? It has a very well written ending if you do enjoy plot twists. Without a doubt watch it you won't regret it. It is after all in the discussion for greatest movie of all time.",1
"This film is my favourite of all time! You must watch this!!Everything about this film is phenomenal and the actors do such a wonderful job of portraying the beautiful story line. Going into this film I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it but honestly, it's so well written, acted and directed, I can't believe I didn't watch it sooner!",1
"Comic books are simplistic narratives for children and young teens who lack the sophistication and understanding of people to be able to relate easily to adult books. This is a comic book film, so perhaps I have no right to expect much from it. But the Batman franchise has had a history of attempts to transcend the limits of the comic book genre, and some of the past entries have done fairly well, including the director's previous effort. But this one falls well short of Batman Begins. Regardless of genre, all films depend on characters and acting, and there is no excuse for a large budget film like this having poor acting and a hero is just irritating, as Bale is here. The director's inability to use actors effectively has never been clearer. A hero film like this cannot succeed without characters who are easy to identify with. The shallow characters, which include crude ethnic stereotype villains, are compounded by nervous cutting and scene changes, and most annoyingly, alterations between 1.85 and 2.40 aspect ratios. This film is obsessed with gadgets and fantasy technology. If you like ""neat"" and ""cool"" things but can't understand people's behavior, this film is for you.I am a long-term fan of IMDb and have rarely experienced such a large disparity between my own ratings and the group norm. With this film's stellar ratings, I expected a lot more. I can accept that many viewers enjoyed this more than I did, but there is no way on God's green Earth that this is the fourth best film of all time. IMDb need to take a hard look at their rating system, and consider the possibility of manipulation of the rating system.",1
"An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing..Based on a short novel by Stephen King, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" the movie is as much a fantasy as any of King's horror stories, yet thanks to screenwriter and director Frank Darabont, there isn't a moment we don't want to believe in. Darabont uniquely blends humor and violence, sweetness and brutality, in what may be the best ""feel-good"" movie of the last twenty years. Ultimately, it is a story of hope and triumph, a tribute to Man's ability to overcome all odds. Andy never fails to astound us with his courage and cunning. He manages to ingratiate himself with the guards when he begins doing their tax returns and with the inmates when he helps build the finest prison library in Maine. (And managing to get them a cold beer on a hot day doesn't hurt, either.) Andy's final surprise, though, is his best, and it is enough to encourage even old Red to face the real world. .",1
"The movie Shawsshank Redemption is about Andy Dufresne who is a convicted because he supposedly kill his wife and her love, The narrator is Morgan Freeman as Red, a man that has been in the jail for a long time, Andy is a banker and has very determinant personality. Andy helps the warden with financial things, he is a librarian and he makes the prison better. I like the movie because it show difficult situations in life that you have to face. The loyalty of Red and Andy is beautiful, you can know that in life there are real friends, Andy strengths proves that always you have to stay strong and solve your problems. Shawsshank redemption have the highest score on many trustful pages, there are many beautiful teachings about life. So what are you waiting for this incredible movie?",1
"The Dark Knight was 100% astounding. The first time I think I've ever walked out of a theater and not had a least one complaint. The perfect superhero movie. I'll remember the movie for its top notch performances. Every scene Ledger is in is pure magic. He doesn't steal the scenes hes in, he takes them. Eckhart is absolutely insane as Dent. You really feel for this guy. He is completely controlled throughout the entire movie. Even as Two-Face. Nolan took the screen time to make us believe in Dent and at the end it shows. Bale is perfect as Batman again. Alfred, Fox, Gordon, etc all get there due. I will remember this film mainly for how spread out everything is. Every character is used. The story is complex, but perfect for the particular movie. Visuals are also excellent. I really can't think of one thing I disliked about the film.I'll remember this film for Ledger's and Eckhart's performances, the character development, and the overall fantastic directing on the part of Nolan. The perfect superhero movie. 10 out of a possible 10.",1

"Okay, Let me first start by saying that Christopher Nolan spent 10 years writing this film, so right from the start this film must be worth watching. This isn't your ordinary psychological thriller, it's not something where you can guess the next scene or assume how it will end. A lot of films these days often seem to be recycled, whether they are sequels, remakes, or inspirations from other films. ""Inception"" however, is pure original and it's evident almost from the beginning. The style, music, the entire concept. It is structured in such a way that it seems like it makes a lot of sense than it actually does, as always with anything that is maze-like. Let's just say that when Christopher Nolan was creating ""Memento"" he was warming up. I personally feel ""Inception"" is his best work yet.Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com",1
"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It is much more than just a summer blockbuster or another comic book movie (all though it fits as both of those as well). It's really a lesson in storytelling, sharp and crisp dialog, story arcs, camera direction... every aspect of film really.One thing that usually bothers me in movies (comic movies and otherwise) is the main characters need to have a romantic relationship just because. I even felt this way in Batman Begins. In this movie however the triangle between Wayne, Dent and Dawes serves multiple purposes and helps to drive the film.This movie grabs you from scene one, minute one and doesn't let go the entire time. It is a roller coaster ride better than any I've ridden on with huge drops and more twists and turns than you'll be able to keep track of. It's not that there's a big ""oh my god"" moment (alla sixth sense) but there's enough smaller scale twists to keep you readily engaged.Heath's performance is as good as everyone is saying and the Joker in this film is far creepier than that in the original Batman film. What I don't think is talked about enough is Eckhart's performance and Harvey Dent which is just spot on and extraordinarily powerful. It makes you hope that people like this exist in the world and you can't help but believe in him as much as Rachel, Wayne and the Citizens of Gotham do.This is a movie you most certainly will want to see on the big screen and you'll want to see it as soon as possible. There are things in the movie that people could spoil for you and I guarantee you that people won't be able to not talk about this film, it's just too good.The plot is not so much Batman vs. The Joker (all though there is plenty of that). It's really more about Batman against Batman. Does Gotham really need him? Does he make things worse? Can he ever stop? Can he have a ""real"" relationship? Can he count on his friends? Can Gotham survive without him? All of these things and more are answered in The Dark Knight.",1
"After years of hearing people praise this film, and occasionally catching snippets of it on TV, I made a point of renting the film.The Shawshank Redemption comes from a Stephen King story and has elements that might remind one of Stalag 17 or Cool Hand Luke. But this movie is an original gem. It is a tribute to man's indomitable spirit. And it shows the importance of hope--even in the lives of men who have been institutionalized by an uncaring society via the prison system.Two things that make this film greater than others in the genre are:1. A villain that personifies evil so completely. The warden is made more villainous by his avowed dedication to Christian principles.2. The excellent screenplay creates ""mini-mysteries"" throughout by allowing the viewer to consider what happens at certain times, then revealing the unexpected truths. This engages the audience, and creates twists that entertain.This film deserves the hype it gets.",1
"The movie is one of the best ever. Morgan Freeman is in one of his best roles and Tim Robbins also. When you see it for the first time you do not expect the ending. I have seen it many times and it does not disappoint me each time. This movie is in range of The Game or or Ethernal sunshine of the spotless mind and a few more, that you do not now the outcome in advance. Most of the movies - 99,5 % of them, you know at the beginning who is the ''bad guy'' who will ''win'' at the end... But you see this movies and in a couple of days you do not remember half of the movie and you forget all about it in a month or so... But there are rare movies that you see and this is one of them, that is ''with you'' for ever.",1
"I have never been a comic book fan. The last one I ever read was an ""Archie"" from the 1960s. That being said, I do like adaptations of comics and graphic novels. They make great stories and even better movies that even reach the mainstream audiences. Recent example like ""Spiderman"", ""Ironman"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" have shown that these films handle the crossover very well when in the hands of competent direction.I loved ""Batman Begins"". It seemed a much more realistic and serious attempt than the earlier ""Batman"" franchise movies. Even with Jack Nicholson as the Joker, those movies came off as more silly than fun.SPOILERS*** ""The Dark Knight"" was obviously on my short list of movies coming out this year that I really looked forward to. And overall, I wasn't disappointed. The is a really good movie. It is not, IMHO, an exceptional movie.It IS an exceptional performance by Heath Ledger. A true ""tour-de-force"", knock-you-upside-the-head, smile-till-it-hurts performance that makes the film stand out as this summer's best. Dead or alive, he deserves the Oscar and I'm betting he will get it, albeit posthumously.You can tell that he totally ""immersed"" himself in the role and that might have created the environment that led to his death, as reported. One can't easily move in and out of character when one takes it ""so seriously"", pun intended.But as I hinted in my overall enjoyment of the film, this performance alone does not make this an exceptional movie. I realize that the Fanboys are going to take exception to that comment. But if all aspects are looked at objectively, this, I believe, will be the common opinion.Christopher Nolan takes us on a great ride. He is easily placed near the top of a list of directors who can envision the transformation from comic to film with ease. He tells a great story, fills it with unique action sequences and captures the feel of the darkness that lives and breathes in Gotham City.But it is partly this ""capturing"" that keeps it from being a truly great film. The overall look of the picture is dark, very dark. Not just visually (which it is greatly) but also in a negative emotional level. Very few scenes show daylight. Very few scenes show hope. And at 152 minutes... that's a lot of ""darkness"" for a viewer to experience.Yes, I realize that the movie is called ""The Dark Knight"". And that ""darkness"" was an important factor in ""Batman Begins"" to let the audience feel what it is that drives Bruce Wayne to become this hero of the night. But in this episode, it just goes a bit too far. That coupled with Batman's gravely voice (done to extreme by Christian Bale) makes the movie hard to see and hard to hear. My ears aren't that great, but even someone with perfect hearing is going to have trouble getting all this dialogue, in one viewing, as it's often mumbled.The other performances are generally up to, or above, what you would expect from such a great line-up. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, give their usual perfect performances in roles that suit them well. And Gary Olldman is at the top of his form as Commissioner Gordan. This is one of the finer portions of the film as he gets to expand his character beyond past entries.Aaron Eckhart, I'm sure, did what it was that the director likely wanted for him but his performance is hurt by a mild flaw in the story writing. He plays the new District Attorney Harvey Dent who comes into town on a white horse, ready to take on any and all bad guys at any cost. But in the latter part of the story, he suddenly becomes unable to survive the ""any cost"" part. His love, Rachel Dawes (played sufficiently by Maggie Gyllenhaal, but not as tenderly as Katie Holmes did) dies near the end and suddenly this White Knight can't see beyond the pain to go after the true culprit in her death. He morbidly becomes ""Two Face"" (arch criminal in some Batman comics?) and blames Gordon and Batman for all his woes. This was the weakest part of the story for me, and I believe that had they left out this plot-line it would have made the movie a bit shorter (which would have helped the overall picture) and it would have kept the focus on the duel between Batman and the Joker, and that's where the focus of this film should never have strayed from. Just as in ""Spiderman 3"", this movie is hurt by 1 too many plot-lines.But these are simply minor annoyances that, although they do detract from the film, simply keep it from being the best Superhero movie of all time. That award, I think, still belongs to ""Spiderman"".In conclusion, go see ""The Dark Knight"", you will not be disappointed. And the performance by Heath Ledger is absolutely not to be missed. He makes Jack Nicholson's attempt look amateuristic, which it truly wasn't. But this one goes so close to perfection that anything pales in comparison.My rating for the movie would have been a 7+. add in Ledger's stellar performance (a perfect 10) and we get the movie close to a 9. A half point deduction for the ""Two Face"" distraction and the length and darkness of it and we end up at a very solid 8 and 1/2! I know that many fans will think this a perfect 10, and I can understand their point, but they are biased. For the overall movie lover who gets as much enjoyment out of ""WallE"" as he does ""Shawshank Redemption"", this movie will fall somewhere just below those but well above many others.",1
"The Dark Night is one of, if not the best super hero film to ever be made, it surpasses all the hype around it. It is confidently directed, dark and gritty. It doesn't feel like a superhero movie, it feels like a crime drama.",1
"This is one of the movies which is sure to get your heart going. It is very rare for a movie to be of this class. The whole film revolves around a certain plot and whoosh!! Suddenly the plot changes and thickens. This may not be a caper story but it feels like one at the end. And the credit goes to the actors too of course. Edward Norton has done a tremendous job playing the lead and so has Brad Pitt. Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club has been reproduced very well. Though this movie was released in the past millennium, the story is still fresh as of today. This is a movie to look out for and whichever corner of the world you may be on, it is a cert that you are going to enjoy this peach of a story.",1
"OK, there are many raves as to how original 'Inception' is, and it's definitely to be welcomed that a film which works with so many layers should be such a success. And it's more entertaining than 'Prince of Persia', for sure. My fun was spoiled, however, by two factors.One, DiCaprio's role is so similar to the character he played in 'Shutter Island' that, if you know the film, you may get a good idea what's going on before the main plot has even started rolling. That could have been avoided by not using the same metaphors for remembrance (the children, the wife), but I guess it's just a coincidence. My boyfriend, with whom I've seen this and who hasn't seen 'Shutter Island', took some more time to figure out the plot, so I guess it does make a difference if you know that film or not.Two, there's too much kaboom in 'Inception' for filler, as in most of Nolan's other films since 'Memento'. That may be just me getting old, but when a film at first tries to intrigue me with a multi-layered concept, and then bangs away both visually and soundtrack-wise to distort your attention from any plot holes there may be, it's a bit of a let-down. 'Matrix' (well, the first one) worked with its own incoherences, and it still stands as a standard of the genre; I doubt that 'Inception' may, as time passes, outrank it, because repeat viewings of stretched-out gunfire and bomb blasts tend to equal each other in retrospect; it's the engaging moments that create a masterpiece - like Morpheus' breaking of the chains in 'Matrix', or Rutger Hauer's comment that memories vanish 'like tears in rain' in 'Blade Runner'. All the interesting metaphysical talk in 'Inception', as intriguing as it may be, cannot take root in my mind, as there's no character, no emotion, no pain to connect it to.Still, this is an entertaining way to spend an evening to be sure. Just don't expect a life-changing epiphany of sorts, as has been suggested elsewhere.",1
"GOOD!!! Movie Morgan Freeman is a good actor, and he is still kicking it at 80 and hope for many many years to come",1
"when a movie has everything- when it is smart and mysterious, funny and serious, dramatic and moving, when it also has alot to say about the life of each viewer, when it is deep, and when it burns itself in the memory forever- only then can it be called perfect. This was the first time I have seen a movie so complete, that all I thought on the way out was ""I want to see it again and again"". But no matter how many time I'll see it, I will always rememebr the first time. This is the best movie I have ever seen, without any competition.",1
"I think all that discussion about this film's greatness or lack thereof is irrelevant. Nolan has proved that he is a true original, and the question is: has he directed a truly Nolan film? Somewhere in the middle of the film I was worried that he had failed... How could I lose my faith? Then a major plot twist occurs, then another and I realize that the Nolan team is in excellent shape. I had overlooked the clever preparation of the plot twists: once they happen, the exposition of Nolan themes soon follows, enforced by the testosterone of a very exciting action film, and his themes are identity, ethics and the actions that define us. And a great metalinguistic sub-theme, a Nolan's favorite: the philosophy of plot twist, of the tightly woven screenplay, of plots within plots within plots... plots and counter-plots that escalate in the wit matching between extraordinary adversaries, between mind titans, and eventually between good and evil themselves. If evil has no self-imposed limitations, and good by definition does... how could good prevail? You can find some answers in this film... and some of them are really dark.",1
"The Dark Knight is a complex film with a myriad of messages. But at its most basic, the question it poses is this: To what lengths do good people go in order to conquer the worst sort of evil? Must they become a little evil themselves along the way? ""You got rules!"" a broken mob boss tells Batman. ""The Joker_he's got no rules!"" It's a pesky truism our heroes struggle with from the get-go. None of them escape unsullied. ""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain,"" says Dent. But it's when they refuse to compromise that the movie soars.",1
"This is not just a great movie, is a must watch! The movie is a classic, it brings many truly dramatic moments, with some real life experiences and everything is just in the right place. As said, a must watch!",1
This is a fantastic entry into Christopher Nolan's trilogy. Have watched this probably around 10 times over the past 12 years and it never gets boring.,1
"Inception is one of those movies that have a complex plot story which requires you to focus on every little detail that happens on the screen otherwise you'll be stuck there scratching your head as you rewind back to the scenes that you supposedly missed. Because of how it deals with the interesting idea of lucid dreaming (if you don't know what that it, I suggest you check this website out: http://www.world-of-lucid- dreaming.com/what-is-lucid-dreaming.html) and how Christopher Nolan has captured the moment of the screen with his amazing cinematography and on par film score, I'll award this movie a 7/10 despite the clustered and confusing action sequences.",1
"Amazing directing, amazing performances, amazing plot. When I watched this, I had no expectations. After amazing 148 minutes my mind was blown.",1
"Listen, this movie is great, but in the future if you were to ask me what my top 5 films of all time are, we will all forget about this until someone mentions it. This is a great movie hands down, and i think what played the biggest part in this film was the music. If it wasn't for that ""THX"" sound byte continuously playing throughout the film this film wouldn't have been as intense as it was. If you played the same sound byte in No Country for Old Men, you would've been more terrified by Chigurh than the Joker's character.I personally believe, sad to say, but the death of Heath Ledger has led to many to automatically rank this as a ten. Yes, it's a great and stellar performance from the late Heath Ledger, but I think just knowing that he's dead and you watching him on the screen has led you to gather more fear for this villain cause of the nerves instilled within you of a man who just died couple of months ago. He deserves an Oscar for his performance, hands down, but I still believe Javier Bardem's character was more frightening than the Joker.In conclusion, what I think is grabbing the audience and throwing them over the hill for this movie is the fact that it's a comic, and usually comics are just a fun ride. This, on the other hand was dark and caught them all off guard. With that, it has explored the pop culture from their common joy ride of comics and has given them a ride that they can't handle. It's the same as entering City of God, Children of Men, No Country without knowing what the movie is about.Props to Nolan for making a great film. I'm a bit bitter due to the fact that this film is number 1 of all time, and it really looks like there's no turning back. It's a top 30 in my eyes, but I actually like no country more, so let's say a top 40. (and i just checked, when the hell did NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN DROP TO 70??!?!? That's close to being as ridiculous as Do the Right Thing not being on the list.)You can hate me all you want.",1
"The movie is Fantastic, cant Even imagine how Fantastic it is one of the Best and high rated movie ever!",1
"This movie is making me nostalgic and lost. Super interesting, emotional and great acting",1
"Christopher Nolan has done something incredible with this movie. As I right this several days after I saw the Dark Knight, several days after it's opening, The Dark Knight is the highest rated movie of all time on IMDb. I find this fascinating for several reasons. Is The Dark Knight the most cinematically brilliant movie ever made? No. Is The Dark Knight the most entertaining movie ever made? No. Is the Dark Knight the best written movie ever made? No. What The Dark Knight does have is an incredibly well balanced mix of all three. And, one of the greatest performances I have ever seen, certainly the best by a villain, played by an actor who, we now realize, would have probably evolved into the next great actor of our generation had he lived.Any discussion of The Dark Knight must begin, and end, with Heath Ledger. With his performance as The Joker, he is unrecognizable as the Heath Ledger as we know him from interviews. He completely transforms. Every piece of his performance is crafted perfectly, along with a brilliant technical use of camera acting skills, so that it becomes truly what modern acting on should be. An independent and artistic creation, recursive and contained within the film itself. A masterwork.That being said.The movie itself is not perfect from any stand point, but it combines all aspects very well into something that hasn't really been seen before. The script is a little long, and there is a plot development involving Aaron Eckhart's character which tries to cram too much psychology into too short a time. The cinematics and structure are excellently crafted, but nothing that hasn't been seen before. The movie doesn't have the most exciting fights ever.But, this is what it does have. Each piece of this film is carefully founded on a deep mythology, based in the comic books, but compressed onto the screen, that is able to combine equally all of those above elements so expertly, it's hard too see how anyone would be disappointed. Carefully layering one piece on top of each other, and combining it with great acting, you discover a movie that is not an Oscar movie, not a blockbuster, but something greater than the sum of all it's parts. A movie that is can discuss deep psychology and moral issues, be entertaining, and be an art film, all at the same time.This movie is brilliant.",1
"I have been into movies since, well I was 5. But after about 15 years I finally was lucky enough to come across this title. I had a huge expectation when I started watching it.Hey! it ain't number 1 for show that much i can vouch for. Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumps.The film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the faculty.The film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them . The friendship, the hardship, the simplest joy, the tragedies , the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directed.The movie makes you feel good.After watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanity.I am no critic but this movie made me happy, ecstatic and I would love to re-watch it again and again. so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not. You will love it no matter what your taste in films are. Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible. And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions. If you don't then well I will be a bit surprised.P.S 1994 was the year of Forrest Gump. It took home all the awards. Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times. Thank You...",1
"First of all, what a wonderful performance from Heath Ledger. He immersed himself totally in the role as the Joker, a much more sinister and psychotic portrayal than Jack Nicholson's 1989 performance which was also excellent. Was his performance alone good enough to propel this film to number one on the IMDb website? Absolutely not!! Do not believe the hype!! Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are veterans of the screen and are very easy to watch. Christian Bale as Batman was quite ordinary this time around and I imagine his throat was very sore by the end of production with all the growling he did. The character development of Batman as a person was well thought out in Batman Begins. We saw him face his fears and conquer them, something very much at the heart of authentic Martial Arts training and provided an insight into the character we as the audience could relate to. In the Dark Knight, he appears too one dimensional. His guilt at the death of innocent lives by the Joker is for the most part portrayed by bland expressions and plenty of growling when disguised as Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal was just plain bland as Rachel Dawes. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between herself and Christian Bale in the one romantic scene they had together. I thought there was more chemistry with Katie Holmes and Christian in Batman Begins. I found myself nodding off when she had screen time with Aaron Eckhart. Thankfully, the director must have reviewed her lack luster performance up to this point and decided the only option left was to blow her up. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent was for the most part quite bland also, but improved somewhat after becoming Two Face. His scene in the hospital with Heath Ledger was his one saving grace. The hand to hand combat was quite ordinary in TDK. With Batman being a practitioner of Ninjutsu , there was no dynamic display of technique to marvel at, or the subtleties of subterfuge (psychological) like in Batman Begins for which this art is known to employ. The film dragged at the end and needed to finish half an hour earlier. Overall, Heath carries the film with his performance, but there was a lot in the film that felt disjointed and not up to par with the original.",1

"If there were ever a film to capture the pre-millennial experience, this is it. A deeply thoughtful film that follows a depressed man (Norton) on the verge of a breakdown all the while choosing to focus on action and dialogue equally.
The performances are stunning and the film is a classic for every generation.",1
"This movie takes you through the life of some inmates of Shawshank prison. A very moving story.One of the best stories I've had the pleasure of seeing in a long time.Normally, I don't go out for these types of movies (sci-fi/classic horror fan). This one really surprised me. I actually didn't see it in the theater, but caught it on TV, then rented the movie. I've since bought it and have actually watched it a few times, which is rare for me to do. I usually watch a movie once, then not again for at least 6 months to a year.This movie will one day be a classic in my mind.Enjoy!",1
"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.",1
"The logical relationship has always been clear, and while looking at it, I'm impressed that this is not generally the ability to build. Layer upon layer, grand and complex and clear regulations. So much so that when you walk out of the theater and look around, there is a sense of film shooting in your eyes. The doubt about whether it is a dream or a real one seems to be brought to your mind along with the film. If one's ability to build can be as strong as this, really, how can one accept the bondage of reality?",1
"The most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex and most viscerally thrilling super-hero movie of all. It transcends the genre.",1
"This might be one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. This movie contains so many little details that eventually complete the whole ending, that it leaves you shocked. This movie shows you the true worth of hope and patience. I did not think that I would like this movie that much because it is not really my type of genre. But when I finally watched it, it became one of my favorite movies of all time. It makes you feel better and it actually gives you hope. The importance of friendship and to never lose hope.This film also has two wonderful actors who can really express their complex characters very well. It was a movie that is not special because of the effects in it, but the story actually makes the whole film. The story can genuinely move you. The script and the dialogue were also really good, all the words that were spoken fitted perfectly in the movie.I would recommend this movie to everyone and I hope they will appreciate this movie as much as I do.",1
"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.",1

But as I sad in this movie we don't have amazing Cinematography, Film Editing, Original Scores...",1
"Let me preface this comment by saying I'm not a huge fan of comic books or comic book movies by default, but I do enjoy the genre if it's done well. I really enjoyed Batman Begins, and the Frank Miller take on Batman in the Dark Knight Returns. As much as I liked them however, they felt like a ""comic-book"". Not to deride the genre, but if you read a lot of comic books you probably know what I mean when I say this. There's a certain level of cheese and immaturity associated with any character that straps on tights and an animal-themed costume to battle crime.However, the question that kept going through my mind when watching the Dark Knight was ""Is this really a comic-book movie?"" And I think that's no accident. Chris Nolan is certainly a master of his art and every choice that was made in this movie seemed to spring out of this idea. The sepia tone is out, replaced with a more ultra-realist look: when it's night, it's dark and when it's day it's light. The characters are somewhat over-the-top but ultimately believable: the word superhero and supervillain is never used in the movie, and even their comic-book names seem to be rarely (if ever) uttered. And the action is cool, but hardly over-the-top. The only thing that's really ""comic-book"" about the movie is Batman's costume, which is made about as practical as possible while still staying true to the character. It's all tied together with a rock-solid script that asks tough, thought-provoking questions, yet never gives way to a dull moment (in fact, it was so intense I think it gave me heart palpitations).Certainly a risky move to pull in a film that's appealing to an audience that is generally looked down upon by the mass media. But I think Nolan (and his brother) give their audience much more credit than the typical movie maker and it pays off--well, it did for me.What I'm trying to say is this movie is good. It's so good you may, like me, find yourself questioning your definition of ""comic-book"" movie.",1
"When I was at camp, we were all twisted and started our own Fight Club inspired fights after the counselors went out to party in the town nearby. We would pull down our mattresses to create a cushion near the edges of the bunk beds. No one was suppose to violate the three rules of Fight Club, but it did not work out as well in the film, as after several nights of our fights, boys from the nearby camp sneaked into our camp so they can watch our bouts. No one seriously got hurt like the fights in the movie, Fight Club, but in retrospect our fights were far sexier. Our Fight Club was brought to an end, due to the one time one of my bunkmates got injured. After being pushed and wrestled to the ground, one girl tried to kicked the other girl, but instead kicked the steel frame of one of the bunk beds. Her toe began bleeding, so we took her to the infirmary. She told the nurse she tripped on a rock, while walking to the bathhouse, but the nurse alerted the camp director. When the camp director went to investigate, she found a cabin in disarray with teenagers in underwear surrounded by mattresses and boys. The next day, parents were called, and we all blamed our behavior on Fight Club. For the rest of camp, the director made our counselors stay in our cabins at night. They were upset they couldn't go out anymore at night to party, so as punishment, they made us watch Fight Club every night for the rest of the summer.",1

"A modern masterpiece, nothing short of cinematic genius. Saw this movie first in high school and no other movie, to date, has made the impact on me that Fight Club has. It's a philosophically insightful critique of western society. Not to mention the camera work and dialog are superb. When I first saw it I didn't even have to look to find out who the director was, the lighting simply screamed Fincher. Fincher will always be one of the best modern directors but this film is undoubtedly the high point of his career. Rarely does a film come along that truly pushes the boundaries set by society in the way that this one does. Already achieving cult status this movie, I have no doubt, will go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made.",1
"From where 'superhero' moves begun this had come miles ahead, the graphics stunned me, whilst watching in the Cinema at the time of release you could have closed your eyes & imagined being on the set of filming - Awesome production, hands down one of the best & can only ever get better knowing technology is quickly advancing, im yet to watch the new batman vs superman movie but if this is anything to go by im more than looking forward to it, although, there is a lot of work to keep up with so i can only hope im not left within disappointment! I would reccomed this movie over & over again & have watched is roughly 30times myself still in attempt to get over such amazing production & work put into each scene individually!",1
Easily what you want in a good super hero/action flick.,1
"Thrilling exciting fighting, ups and downs of the tension of the plot, a link to link the potential clues, so that people like to visit its real effects, as well as a profound discussion of human nature. In 2008, no matter from which point of view to review, the dark knight is undoubtedly the most perfect legend of the year, worthy of the world's eternal memory.",1
What a great movie. It's been my fave for years but I never knew just how many other people liked it until I saw that it was ranked #1 on the top 250 list here at IMDB. It may not be the greatest movie ever made but everyone who has seen it liked it. I can't imagine anyone hating this movie. The best part of the whole movie is when Red walks down the beach in Mexico and meets his friend on the boat. You know everything's going to be okay after that.,1
"The last pet project of Nolan between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight (The Prestige) was enough of a masterpiece to show that a) Nolan is a first rate director, b) the Batmans are just a fun ride for him. This is the stuff he really is meant to do. Films like Memento and The Prestige. This is his source. The assertion is vindicated with Inception, which again is his new pet project between Batman 2 and 3. Again, it shows just how much more than The Dark Knight Nolan is capable of. Inception is essentially Memento on steroids. The same central themes and ideas are present in both films, only this time, the budget is bigger and the scale eventually reaches epic proportions, with ground-breaking visuals, globe and reality spanning action and an appropriately bold and adrenaline-rich score by Nolan favorite Hans Zimmer. But the heart and soul of both features are intimately connected, down to small details. Likewise, The Prestige shared the same core with these two, even though obscured by the different epoch it was set into. But the idea is always the same, the question of what is real and what imagined and the loss of self trying to navigate through the different layers of ""reality"". There is always some major construct which is utilized as the catalyst to spawn alternate realities. In Memento it was amnesia, in The Prestige, magic (or science), in Inception, dreams. In all cases the main character is on some kind of redemption mission for the demise of his beloved one. The similarities between Memento and Inception in particular don't stop there. Both have protagonists advancing past the point where they can tell fantasy from reality. Even the plot device used to distinguish the two (tattoos in Memento, ""totems"" in Inception) is identical. But of course, Inception isn't just a rehash of the previous two Nolan powerhouses. If it did, it would be instantly dismissed, regardless of big cast and production values. The way it handles the concept of dream manipulation and the ""dream within a dream"" layers is singularly original, both in principle and in its visual execution. The most compelling part of the concept is the dilating time, as one proceeds from one dream layer into another and it is utilized to the limit to advance major plot points. The movie also stays remarkably true to the rules it sets. There is a spectacular action sequence taking place inside a rotating corridor (don't ask), where events taking split second in one dream layer are accurately portrayed to correspond to a few seconds in the next layer due to ""dream time"".The film is also a mixture of many cinematic (and not) influences. There is a good dose of Dark City here, a dash of Existenze, a tinge of Johny Mnemonic, a little bit of Dreamscape and The Cell, traces of Matrix and even an overall fragrance of Blade Runner permeating everything (including Zimmer's score). But make no mistake, the primary blueprint for this movie is Dark City. Many of the core elements like the reconstructing cityscapes, the lack of memory of a beginning, the labyrinth structures, mental and physical, the illusion of reality, are taken straight from there. This is only yet another testament of how important and influential this movie has been over the past 12 years, despite being criminally underrated. Many of the above mentioned films borrowed or blatantly stole from it (I am looking at you Matrix!) and Inception is no exception. Thankfully Nolan knows how to put together a decent script and infuse it with originality and depth, while incorporating in an organic way existing ideas and concepts. He also avoids overindulging in points where his influences have already performed admirably. You might have seen the spectacular folding city sequence in the trailers, but believe it or not, this kind of gimmick is hardly ever used throughout the film and is tangential to the actual plot. Nolan knows better that to copy straight out of Dark city, he has other fish to fry. And the result is much more than just the sum of its parts. It isn't an adventure movie, neither a pure sci-fi nor drama. The script is clever enough to actually blend the genres together by avoiding over-exposition of any of them. We never get to know enough information about the dramatic background of the characters, or the goal (or even the outcome) of the operation, or the mechanics involved in dream-navigation and this is a good thing. We learn some stuff, but it is always sketchy enough to not draw too much attention to any particular aspect of the story.DiCaprio has been staring in 2 out of 2 best films so far this year. Not bad and not surprising either, I can't remember him playing in anything short of outstanding over the past 6 years. But Inception is primarily an ensemble piece and the extended, all-around superb cast (a Nolan trademark by now) really delivers in a major way, especially the smaller parts (Murphy and Watanabe in particular are brilliant). Like most of Nolan's signature works, this one needs repeated viewings to take it all in, there is just too many things to digest in just one pass. But above all, there is material here that will really make you think deep, because the plot device used here, dreams, is something everyone is familiar with and you will be more than eager to juxtapose your perspective with Inception's interpretations. The questions asked (and the directions suggested) are, to say the least, compelling, and this is what great science fiction is all about.",1
"Ever wonder what it would be like if you could control your dreams? Seeing your subconsciousness as a reality maybe even confusing the two, well in the film Inception we are taken on a journey of what this would be like. As viewers this film is heavily interactive As for an artistic value this film did an exceptional job at connecting the viewers to the plot with well thought out camera shots as well as lighting and sound. There are many close ups that let us in on the characters thought processes. The sound stands out and is a constant underlying reminder of what we as viewers should be feeling at any particular moment. The soundtrack is intense yet emotional, tying the simple shots together. Next we will look at Entertainment value, the film has been awarded in several different categories. It is an intricate but fast paced plot that keeps you from getting bored or distracted. You're always trying to figure what level of dream they are on and whose dream it actually is. This film's cast was well thought out and a lot of talent is displayed. By examining the educational value you will be surprised on how much you are actually earning even if some of the dream theories are far fetched. Inception plays off the real concept of lucid dreaming but takes it a step or four farther pushing past reality and seeing where the mind can take us. The last value we will look at is the Literary value, the success of the theme and the meaning behind just another exciting action movie. There could be several themes combed out of this film but a quite obvious one is that our loved ones are never truly gone. We see this when Cobb's is in the deepest layer of the movie and he explains to Mal he couldn't create her as beautiful as she was with all of her imperfections and flaws. He was hurting himself more by keeping her there and he needed to let her go. In conclusion Inception does an excellent job at presenting all four values into the film keeping it entertaining, artistic, educational but also full of meaning. It has excellent cinematography and unique shots paired with talented actors to give the audience the puzzled effect the director Nolan desired. I would give this film a 9 out of 10.",1
"This film will be a classic before it leaves the theatre. The spectacular elements, death defying sequences, visual beauty and an actual story are just wonderful. There are enough comments out there that I do not need to go on and on, but, this film deserves all accolades, end of story. The best villain in history is now the Joker, for he is portrayed as he is not as the world would perceive him. Bravo! The batman is dark at the beginning of the film but reaches a new level of Gothic thriller without becoming bogged down by morose stereotypes. This film has one flaw and that is the rating, it is too low. This film should be rated R. The graphic violence is enough that my own mother had issues finishing the film, and the appearance of Dent after his accident as well as the magic pencil were enough to vilify this film in her eyes. I grew up with Batman as my role model, and this film supersedes my expectations.",1
"After seeing this movie I was left speechless. Heath Ledger put on the single best performance I have seen from an actor. His performance was so gripping that I got chills after every word he spoke. He had me clinging to my seat just from his presence. If he is not nominated for an Oscar it is an injustice to society. Everyone from Christopher Nolan to Gary Oldman made this movie the best it could possibly be. The performances from every actor and actress was phenomenal. I felt like I was actually in Gotham City. I recommend that everyone who has a car, $8, and self dignity goes out and sees a masterpiece ""The Dark Knight"".",1
"I can think of quite a few descriptions for THE DARK KNIGHT. But truthfully, it is very difficult to describe how the film went above and beyond my expectations. Christopher Nolan's latest is a near masterpiece that is smothered in atmosphere, and delivers all the thrills you'd expect and more. First off, while BATMAN BEGINS reawakened the comic book hero, the latest chapter offers up the best Batman? ever. Nolan introduces a brand new character that he brilliantly shoots around, he surrounds the dark buildings with shades of blue and sweeps through the streets and alley ways. That character is Gotham City. Okay, this is not the first time we've seen his Gotham. But this time around it feels more alive and it seems to be closing in on the good and the bad, as criminal activity takes over what may have once been a beautiful, bustling city. It is so splendidly photographed, that every shot of this majestic land brings us closer and closer into their world. This is by far, his most daring and ambitious film. In fact, this is one of the few superhero film that is absolutely Oscar worthy. This is as good of a Best Picture as any film could be.As far as the plot is concerned, I think it would be better for you to know as little as possible. There is a very strong and effective story with a wonderfully written script by Christopher and his brother Jonathan. They give each and every character a real reason to exist. The dialogues are surprisingly smart, as are the people that live and breathe in this world of mayhem. And that mayhem, is mostly created by a nasty little character called The Joker. If you've seen the trailers for the film, it won't surprise you that Heath Ledger is great in the role. But he is more than great, he is absolutely frightening and brilliant. The character is evil incarnate, a man who feels no empathy and evokes no sympathy. He is referred to as a mad dog even by himself: ""I'm a dog chasing cars,"" he tells his do-gooding nemesis. ""I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it."" Backing up this notion with evocative cinematography, returning director and co-writer Christopher Nolan includes a near-silent shot of Ledger in pancake makeup leaning out the window of a Gotham City police car, hair streaming and the wind in his jowls, like a happy Doberman.""Madness is like gravity,"" the Joker gloats at one point. ""All it takes is a little push."" Belief works the same way.The Joker is the world's first anarcho-terrorist; interested neither in power nor money, he simply wants to see things go boom. He is a close cousin to Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men, but even that guy was taking orders from someone.Late in the game, suspended upside down from a bit of Bat rope, the Joker smiles (as he must) and tells his captor: ""I think you and I are destined to do this forever."" Alas, not.As for the rest of the cast, I would hate to see the wonderful Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent not receive the accolades he deserves. I've always thought he was a terrific actor, but he really delivers in TDK. Harvey Dent is a true hero in a mob infested world. He is a man for the people that wants to save his beloved city. Aaron approaches his character with such an honest and sincere performance. As he begins to let the violence and hate seep through him, he undergoes his transformation. In many ways, he is probably the most relatable character in the film. One of the things that makes The Dark Knight the classic it is destined to become, is the perfect casting of both Echkart and Ledger. A superhero flick can only be as good as its villain, and they don't get any better than this.Obviously, I can't go without saying how important Christian Bale is as Batman. It is such a pleasure to see an actor of his caliber playing a role like this. But Maggie Gyllenhaal is also a major improvement over Katie Holmes. I don't dislike Ms. Holmes as a actress, in fact, I find her quite charming. But Gyllenhaal comes across as a stronger, and more believable heroine.Aside from those I've mentioned, I also have to say that both Gary Oldman and Eric Roberts are a welcome addition. It was nice to see Oldman grow from the first film and it is even nicer to see the guy go against type again, as a non-quirky, oddball free character. He is one of the very best actors of any generation. How wonderful it is to see him as a regular part of the Batman mythology.Yes, I loved THE DARK KNIGHT. It is a moody tale about the struggle of good and evil, and everything in between.Yet in the end, Heath Ledger's Joker, Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent, Christian Bale as The Dark Knight and a phenomenal vision realized by Christopher Nolan makes TDK easily one of the years best.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence. It is a true testament to human will, friendship, and determination. Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling, and satisfying story it entails.",1
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.,1
The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the best movies ever made.It is a simple yet powerful story that really touches your heart. The strength of this movie lies in the fact that the director does not use anything flashy to entice the viewers in this movie. The music by Thomas Newman adds depth and character to the movie and certainly enhances the overall appeal of the movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman prove that good acting trumps over everything else. Frank Darabont also deserves a lot of credit for his direction. It does not feel that this is his first movie. The cinematography of this movie is also excellent and Roger Deakins has done a wonderful job. The biggest strength of this movie is that it tells us to be brave in adverse times and not lose hope even in bad times. We can learn a valuable lesson from this movie and also realize the value of patience. Anyone who has seen this movie will agree with me and most of the people will love to see The Shawshank Redemption again.,1
"camera moving in never seen ways, acting good enough to mention it, electronic soundtrack outstanding and flowing with the movie,meaningful, much much more than just violence, never predictable storyline, wonderful monologues, deep atmosphere, see it twice, one of the best, just my opinion.",1
"I watched this movie a few years ago and didn't like it very much. To my mind it had two major marks against it. First off, I've never liked heist movies. It's a personal quirk but I just don't like 'em. Second, I don't really find movies about dreams interesting. The thing about dream movies is that nothing really matters in them except the last 5 minutes because the question is almost always ""Are they awake or still dreaming"" and that means the rest of the movie doesn't mean ANYTHING. That is indeed how I felt about Inception when I first saw it only he got it down to the last ten seconds that really matters. I can't tell you how many times I've had to see that F*&^ing ending but it's enough that I don't CARE if he's dreaming or not.I watched it today on a whim and what I neglected is that there are two hours of rather solid science fiction writing behind that ending. Maybe I was in a better mood or something but I really enjoyed it this time.I'm also one of those people who see every movie as connected to every other movie so I immediately realized that this movie is the neurotic love child of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Dark City"" which is NOT a bad combination. The good news is that the upcoming ""Doctor Strange"" movie looks like it's borrowing from ""Inception"" a great deal. Maybe if Leonardo Di Caprio had his Wi-fi password we'd know if he was dreaming at the end.So while I still don't think it's worth ALL the hype it has gotten I now feel that this is a good Sci-Fi movie and thriller and totally worth a watch. It is also, you know.... a Christopher Nolan movie and that's always fun. As always Good Watching Everyone.",1
",,The Dark Knight'' ! Another Batman movie ! I was asking myself - is this movie going to be cool ? Is this movie going to be exciting ? And now I have the answer - YES !

Brad pitt is a terrible actor and gave a terrible performance omg this movie makes me sick its so bad i would watch game of thrones season 8 infinite times over,1
"The 30 years friendship of Andy and Red was shown with great emotion and blossomed over time into a life's eternal love.Red: ""I would like to think that Andy fought back against the mothers but he didn't.""Red constant support and gifts to Andy everytime he had sex with another inmate
was so heart warming.Finally, Red's overwhelming joy when he was freed after 30 years in prison and his only thought was seeing Andy.Red riding the bus to Mexico: ""I was like a child who couldn't hold a thought in his head. I couldn't stop thinking of seeing my friend Andy again and shaking his hand.Red traveled thousand of miles and the scene where they hug again on the beach then the movies fades to the The End.What a way to start a lifelong love affair.",1
"One of the best inspirational movies out there. It has everything: humor, action, drama. A journey of a man that makes the best of every situation. If you want to end a chill weekend have a go at it on a Sunday night. It will definitely make your Monday bearable!",1
"The Shawshank Redemption 'Get busy living, or get busy dying.' (Darabont, 1994). These insightful words changed the cinema experience forever. In 1994, Frank Darabont released his ninth film, The Shawshank Redemption, just one of his cinematic triumphs. This film tells a story of an unlikely friendship between an innocent man Andy Dufrense, sentenced for two murders and a convicted murder, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding. Together they hope to one day become free men and experience life outside the prison walls. This is a film that touches every viewer's heart, a movie that has changed many lives. The Shawshank Redemption is renowned as being a landmark movie by association of the characters, crimes and confessions that played major roles in the film's success. The actors chosen for this film are one of the main reasons as to why this movie was so successful. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play the two leading roles throughout The Shawshank Redemption. As well as a main character throughout the film, Morgan Freeman also narrates a vast quantity of the film. Morgan Freeman won several awards for best actor and best supporting actor for his part in The Shawshank Redemption. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, the innocent man wrongly jailed. The two characters become instantly believable from the first time they meet. Red bets 10 cigarettes that Andy will be the first to break, Andy however defies Reds statement. This bond becomes inseparable. The opening scene is of Andy being sentenced in a courtroom, the camera changes between Red in prison and Andy travelling to the prison until the two separate stories collide. The viewers meet Red and his mates and soon become emotionally attached. Together they grow to accept their fate and they battle the daily challenges that prison has to offer. Andy hides the secret that will change everyone's lives, until one night during a storm. Andy escapes from the Shawshank Prison through a hole, he takes the books containing the bank details from the warden. The cinematography excellence that is displayed constantly throughout this film is strongly displayed once Andy has finally escaped. The camera goes from being a low angle that follows Andy through the sludge to a high Angle allowing us to see Andy with his outstretched arms. This is quite possibly the most powerful scene in the entire film. Andy makes a new life for himself as Randall Stevenson. The Shawshank Redemption taught us all that there's more than meets the eye in everything we do. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the first movies to have an entire story line based off a successful prison escape. This film exposed what prison is actually like and how prisoners are treated. The Shawshank Redemption also debunked how you were guilty until proved innocent. Frank Darabont rids your imagination of what ifs and replaces it with when. The Shawshank Redemption uses the posters, given to Andy as presents from Red, to cover the hole that would ignite Andy Dufrense big escape. It is once that Andy has wriggled out of his prison cell one night that he finally has the chance to escape. With each clap of thunder, Andy strikes the sewage pipe with a rock until he finally breaks through, he then crawls for 500 yards through sewage. Andy Dufrense escapes the Shawshank prison to live a new life as Randall Stevenson. Although an iconic landmark movie, The Shawshank Redemption did not receive a single Oscar or Golden Globe. The film received 36 award nominations and went on to win 19 of these nominations. This stop motion picture was a box office success, making a profit of over $28 million. Having spent just $25 million of the making of this movie, the overall profit wasn't bad. The responses from this film were overwhelming positive. Many views stated the fact that this was a movie that will never be forgotten. And how although written by Stephen King, it is unlike any of his other cinematic triumphs. Frank Darabont did extraordinary job of replicating Stephen Kings Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The similarities between the book and the movie are defiantly a stand out, however there was one difference that stunned us all. Why did the movie and the book have different titles? Frank Darabont intentionally changed the name of the movie as he believed with the same name as the book, it would turn some people away. This was as a because of Rita Hayworth's name in the title, however Frank Darabont did completely rid the film of Rita. Instead he incorporated it into the film by it being the very poster that hides the hole that Andy escapes from. The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic successful that has changed the film industry. The Shawshank Redemption is an iconic landmark film that has changed cinema forever. The characters, crimes and confessions from this film have changed the way we see daily objects. The actors chosen to partake in their roles did exceptionally well, making the film so successful. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is never going to go out of style. It will forever remain in the forefront of viewers minds.",1
"And that's all you need to know. The Nolan kite mark has been well and truly stamped on this fine movie. Yep it's a mind scramble, but it's on of those very few films that has you thinking during and well after you've seen it. Bravo, Mr N!",1
"When I entered the theater to see this film, I was expecting something a little bit too hyped.Boy, was I wrong...I have never seen a superhero movie, that in such a way, managed to interpret it's material. Instead of making this another CGI struggle, they tried taking what Batman stands for, and making a masterpiece out of it. They took the two supervillains, that have the most psychological depth, and it worked perfectly.This might just be the most compelling view of the darkest reaches of the human psyche since Apocalypse Now",1
"No doubt, Fight Club is one of the best films of the decade and it deserves its overwhelming good reputation. Edward Norton plays his second-best role after his terrific performance in American History X and Brad Pitt does best in dark and bizarre films so he is absolutely right in Fincher's masterpiece. From the beginning it becomes clear that this is no film for people who just want to relax in their seat with some popcorn and a cola trying to spend a smooth evening. You really have to think and this is what makes it a good film. A man is frustrated about his life and searches for something completely different. Honestly, that's not a very new idea but Fincher is able to give it a new direction. He radicalizes his characters and shows brutality in a direct and uncovered way. The perversion of society gets a face in Tyler Durden and the ones who follow his ""new way"". The narration is what impressed me most. Who are absolutely shocked when you have to realize that Tyler is not the one he seems to be... To give a conclusion: Not my favourite, but a very, very good film!",1
"Everyone knows you always save the lady not the guy! Except whoever wrote this script I guess. This movie is way overrated by movie goers. I don't know how to explain what is happening out there in movie land but movies that at best are good are getting these rave reviews. Dirty hairy would have shot the joker in about the first 5 minutes and saved us 2 or more hours of absurd violence. Let me see if I can sum this movie up, the bad guy is killing dozens of people, while the good guys including the so called Dark Knight are wondering around doing nothing until all hell breaks lose. The basic story line of this movie has been done before and better in the Crow. At the least the Crow knew what to do with bad guys, you kill them. This Batman was the wimpiest yet and got his ass kicked several times. I think Adam West from the 60's batman farce and whoever was Robin could have done a better and quicker job of mopping up this Joker. Heath Ledger got a little to preachy for my taste, just shut up and be bad. Oh and for those who read deeper meaings into this movie, like the Joker representing world wide terrorism and Batman using unethical methods to combat him(monitoring cell phones) give me a break. This is a comic book hero, no wonder I bought Marvel comics as opposed to DC 10 to one.",1
"Edward Norton has outdone himself again! I have yet to see Norton play a poor role. Fight Club is a electrifying movie with a great storyline full of twists and turns. Brad Pitt also gives an outstanding performance. If these two guys don't get awards for these types of performances then theres gotta be something wrong. I mean it has all three of the most important components to a great movie(sex, violence, great characters).",1
"This is the best film for guys! It is my 3rd favorite movie ever, and it's definitely worth watching! This is an action-packed movie about... well... sorry I can't tell you. If I told you, I would be breaking the first 2 rules of... yeah. The description of the movie might help though! It keeps your attention the ENTIRE movie! Not many movies can successfully do that! Girls might like this movie too, but just like The Lord of the Rings movies, not as many women would enjoy it like men do! This is the best action movie I have ever seen and a lot of people will agree! This definitely deserves the spot it has in the top 250 movies. It is in the TOP 10! Now that is impressive. If you are an action movie type of guy, then you should DEFINITELY check this movie out! It is 100% amazing, it's awesome, and you will NOT regret watching it! If this is your first night at IMDb, you HAVE to watch it!",1
Probably the best movie ever made... Motivational... Quotes are simply amazing...,1
"I recall wanting to watch this movie randomly just to watch the opening bank robbery scene. By the time the credits started rolling, I forgot that I only wanted to watch the beginning, because it's that good of a movie that you are glued to your seat with your mind fully engulfed in the story.",1
"This movie was a great movie I watched it repeatedly, at first it was because I was trying to grasp information that subtly escaped my memory soon as movie was over...laughing out loud I really enjoyed the story line though I felt there were some big holes in it. I am thinking the cause though for the holes were due to editing film to ensure it didn't go past a certain length time. Inception captured my attention throughout. What I really want to know is are they going to do a part 2 or something? Also, if my review lacks the luster of most I am completing this review to also complete IMDb tasks for developing a new account so... cheers. Inception is the best also the actors in it played the rolls well I am almost convinced that this could be a real life practice one day or as a conspiracy theorist would say... Is already happening",1
"While you may not easily give into the hype of THE biggest viral marketing scheme seen in recent memory, I urge you to. For a cinematic experience like no other, The Dark Knight MUST be seen in cinemas (or IMAX if you're lucky enough) at least once before it's DVD release.First, I must mention Christopher Nolan, the genius director behind such instant-mega hits like Memento and The Prestige. He truly has reinvented the comic book genre, his pacing and authentic style can really be felt throughout the entire film. The man can construct a narrative for the big screen like no one else - I am able to confidently say that he is the Stanley Kubrick of the new generation.Heath Ledger, of course, has perfected the role of the Joker into making a truly iconic villain and his performance will be referred to as possibly the best movie villain portrayed in a film.As for Christian Bale, as Bruce Wayne he was able to convince the people of Gotham that he was a rich snob who threw party's every once in a while - the American accent, along with the personality he portrays reminds me of Patrick Bateman from ""American Psycho."" As Batman, he overdid the role just a bit. The deep voice was a bit too much - but I still believe no one has been able to pull off a better Batman than him. But, if we count Adam West, he may have some competition.For me - it was the music that sent this film from action blockbuster to an epic, though-provoking masterpiece. The crescendo score used when building up suspense was terrifying. But the best part of all was that the score was not over-used, the loud drum beat was used very rarely and when it was, the rush of excitement will plunge through you, instantly.The storyline was clearly very well though out, it asks questions about abandoning codes and ethics, subtle undertones of terrorism in modern society. At many points of the film, many different time lines are occurring at once, this adds to the excitement and suspense of the film and you'll realize only once you leave the cinema that you have been on the edge of your seat in a constant feeling of anticipation - and for a near 3 hour movie to do that, you can truly appreciate this film for what it is and has done.It has set a new standard in not just superhero movies, not just action blockbusters, but for cinema across the board - Chris Nolan has created a masterpiece and if he does decide to make a third Batman, we can only hope he makes it even better: a task that seems almost impossible.",1
"This is definitely one of my favorite movies. The story-line was captivating, and unpredictable. I watch it every time any network airs it.The best part about the film is that the actors are very believable. You feel as if you know each and every character personally. There is not a dull moment, and they get right to the plot. There is never a time where you are twirling your thumbs waiting for something interesting to happen. Two thumbs up!",1
"Every human looks for his own redemption
Thanks for all of crew team",1
"If Heath diden't play joker this movie would most likely have been a 6/10, the movie is kinda Classy overall. I don't really wanna say any reasons, this might not have helhed at all. But screen it.
And thank you for reading!",1

"This film is the most important, relevant and superbly made film since 'apocalypse now'. The subject matter and ideas are soo beautifully and painfully accurate to a generation who thinks that nobody else understands.It's one of those movies that articulates the things that everyone feels but have never talked about. It opens doors to new possibilites in life, by identifying and bringing about awareness to the roots of our desires and hence our misery.Never has there been such an amalgam of technical, aesthetic brilliance, direction, performance and subject matter. A film where finally every aspect of the film is the strong point, and is not only a brilliant film but an incredibly positive, social and ideological force that is bringing about change.",1

Redemption of freedom.I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.,1
"Wow. Where do you begin with such a brilliant film. I think this has to be one of if not the best paced movies of all time. The action scenes are so gripping and Heath ledger's performance is just amazing. Usually with rewatching a film you're waiting for that one moment to happen that gives you all that satisfaction you know and love about it. Though, with the Dark Knight, that satisfaction is maintained throughout, as every action scene is equally awesome. The Joker is such an iconic villain as well as Two Face becoming the epic side villain with such a great plot twist. Not to forget all the awesome batman scenes we get!
I don't think there's anything I can personally criticise or would change to make it better; The Dark Knight is a masterpiece.",1
"I was first drawn to the movie Inception, because of the actors that were in this film, Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page to name a few of main characters. I was also drawn in by the complex, yet interesting plot line of dreams and the ability to break in to another individual's subconscious to place a thought or an idea. Although the two and a half hour movie made me nervous whether it would be worth that much time and a red box fee of a buck, all in all I found Inception to be a good movie, not the best of 2010 but definitely on my top ten list for the year.We are brought into the idea of how these characters are able to ""corrupt"" or get inside one another's dreams within the first five minutes, which is both good and bad. Though I enjoyed the plot of this film, I feel like they jumped into the main idea of the plot too soon. Without giving us, the viewers, more of a background on who these characters were, personally and professionally, had me asking a lot of questions through out this film (as if the plot as a whole wasn't complex enough). I found the actors that played these characters to be very fitting for their roles, however, I believe there were several main characters and though they all connected well with the plot, I don't believe we knew enough about them. When looking at the special features and effects that were in this film I can honestly say I was blown away. Not because they haven't been done before, but because they intertwined so well with the idea of dreams and our subconscious. When relating this movie to another that may be similar, it was hard to pin point one that revolved around the same plot. But when it came to similar characters, I couldn't help but notice the similarity between Leonardo DiCaprio's characters in both Inception and Shutter Island. In Inception we see Dicaprio's character being fixated upon a women that we later find out to be his wife and dead. We also see how his character, Cobb can not seem to let go of his past and that causes him to question what our his memories and what is reality. In Dicaprio's film Shutter Island we also see how his character Teddy plays out his fantasies and what he deems reality when in actuality he has gone crazy trying to change his past and live in his altered memory and life he has created. Both films leave you questioning what is real and what is not, which ultimately made these films connect for me.",1
"i saw this movie weeks after its release while hearing about all the hype of how good it was but i was skeptical, now it takes a lot to make me cry in a movie and i almost cried in this not because it was sad it wasn't but because it was sooooo good. Easily the best film of the year if not the last couple years, if this doesn't win an academy award i don't know what will, the plot is stunning the action is top notch, one of if not the best movie I've ever seen and I've seen thousands im a movie buff. Worst part about this site is the ten line minimum for reviews so i will just ramble on and on and on again inception excellent movie should be viewed by everyone.",1
Is it a batman movie or a joker movie? the best so far!!,1
"Words cannot describe the awe I feel for The Dark Knight.I usually try and wind myself down before getting too hyped over movies, but The Dark Knight was different. This was a Batman movie, almost completely like no other.Somehow, despite being immensely hyped for it, The Dark Knight basically shattered all of my expectations and more.The film focuses on four different characters. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is still playing the vigilante Gotham loves and fears, but is wrestling with his commitment to the job. Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) is one of the few good cops left, and is trying to end the crime. Newly elected District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is fighting against the scum of Gotham, and trying to make it a safe place again. And of course, there's The Joker (Heath Ledger), a psychopathic terrorist determined to ensure chaos rules Gotham City.The film handles these plot threads rather delicately. It knows that with the slightest force, it could throw the entire course of the film off. For every moment of greatness these stories development, it reverts and dodges bumpy, cliché-ridden paths. It works because it aims to be unique the whole way through. Writer/director Christopher Nolan (with the help of his brother Jonathan) bit off a lot putting this movie together, but in their dedication to detail and to an inherently complex story, it manages to feel simplistic (and somehow manages to add a bit of emphasis on smaller plot lines involving mobsters and a love triangle between Wayne, Dent and fellow D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Batman Begins' horrendously weak link Katie Holmes)).But in accomplishing the complete synthesis of the main plot lines, the Nolan brothers have also managed to make a truly one of a kind film. Yes, it does build off some ideas from Begins, but it does not depend on them. This film is one that can truly stand on its own, and is an exceptional enough sequel that you do not necessarily need to see the first film to understand what happens here (although it sure does help). It tells its own story, and relies very little on previously related materials. It is what every good sequel should set out to be like. And thankfully, it revels in all the corruption and darkness that the Batman films should have always been about. The grittiness and fearlessness of this film is unlike almost any comic book film ever made, and I doubt it will soon be replicated.But in creating such a screenplay, there is an inherent issue with length. Batman Begins felt a bit too longwinded, and could have rather easily been trimmed. The Dark Knight on the other hand, while it feels too long for true comfort, does not have any bulky areas. It is very spot-on with its scenes, and nearly every scene has a reason to be in the film. If anything was to be done away with, I think the film would have been a much less and not so fulfilling effort (not to mention would lose its thrilling edge it keeps up for the entirety of the movie). So while it does feel a bit too lengthy, it lacks the superfluous nature that films like these usually have. I could have appreciated a few changes made to a near ending action sequence (as it felt a bit too ridiculous and rushed for its own good), but it could have been a whole lot worse.Another area the film shines in is the impeccable special effects. Every last detail is perfect, and not once did I not believe what I was seeing. It amps up everything Begins had, and makes it better. Specific scenes that would have looked horrendously fake years ago look miraculous here. And the speed fighting that plagued Begins has disappeared to a certain extent, leaving the audience a much better way of seeing the action. And of course, the makeup to bring both villains to life (especially a certain 'Two-Faced' character) is beyond extraordinary. It is downright terrifying for how real it looked, at any time.Acting wise, everyone does a fairly great job.Bale, while overshadowed more so than last time, builds upon his pathos-ridden superhero and brings certain three-dimensionality to him. We can see the hurt in his eye, and can see the pain. Even when the majority of his face is covered, he brings an excellent sense of emotion to the character. Much the same goes for Eckhart's Harvey Dent, who spends most of the movie doing what he thinks is right. He is a boy scout for the ages, and delivers a richness and depth to the character I did not think possible. Oldman does another superb job playing Gordon. He was an anchor in Begins, and here he does even more work.Gyllenhaal, while a much better thespian than Holmes, is not given nearly enough to do here. She is not totally useless, but she looks and sounds held back by the confines of the role. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are used very sparingly as well, but when they appear, they do a great job.Which leaves me with Ledger's Joker.Just about everything you have heard about his portrayal is true. He is a complete psychopath, and is totally unrecognizable in the role. You may laugh at some of his shenanigans, but then will take them back when you see the horrifying things he says and does. This brilliant performance is even better than I could have hoped, and is enough to see the movie alone. He may have died, but you will wish he would come back and start acting the moment he opens his mouth.For its small amount of problems, The Dark Knight still manages to be uncompromising in its uniqueness and greatness. It will leave you breathless, and craving more.9/10.",1
"I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.",1
"Its very rare that i give a review for anything on IMDb even though i have been a member for some time now. I only make a exception and wright a review for something that i feel is a true masterpiece, the only other thing that i have reviewed is The Sopranos seeing as i feel that it is a true masterpiece of Television, and since i have written a review on what i feel is a masterpiece of Television, after watching Dark Knight i feel its time to wright a review on what i feel is a masterpiece of cinema. Now it has become a custom that superhero sequel films surpass their original (Superman 2, X-Men 2, Spiderman 2) so it was fair to say that i had high expectations going in to watch Dark Knight. When i came out two and a half hours later all i could say was WOW! The film is a true masterpiece, everything about this film is nothing short of superb.The Plot: I must say the screenplay (written by Jonathan Nolan, Christopher's brother) is excellently written. The Story, written superbly by David S. Goyer, having taken inspiration from many legendary comic books is excellent. It centers around The Dark Knight Batman and his fight against the seedy underbelly that is Gotham's underworld and taking down his nemesis The Clown Prince of Crime. Assisting him is District Attorney Harvey Dent, the so called 'White Knight of Gotham' and Lt Jim Gordon. Now i wont give too much away because the story of the film truly is superb, and revealing too much info would not do the film justice.Direction: This film is what it is purely because of the genius that is Christopher Nolan. He has cemented himself as one the greatest directors of certainly my time, with brilliant films such as Memento, The Prestige,Insomnia, it was a dead certainty that after Batman Begins, The Dark Knight would be equally superb. This Director knows how to make a film.Acting: The acting is the best i have seen from a ensemble cast in years. Christian Bale is easily the best Batman yet fighting for justice in a constant struggle with his enemies. Having to choose between Batman and Bruce Wayne, questioning his own methods. Bale has proved that not all great actors have to be American, with his excellent portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne, and the way he switches characters from Batman to Bruce is also brilliant. Aaron Eckhart portrays Harvey Dent with impeccable class. He brilliantly portrays Gotham's 'White Knight' and his fight for justice and eventual descent into madness and inevitable turn into Two Face. Now his portrayal of Two Face is exactly spot on. Tommy Lee Jones should watch the performance closely as that is how to portray Two Face, not the bumbling fool that he portrayed Two Face to be in Batman Forever. Michael Caine played Alfred Pennyworth flawlessly, as did Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, both playing their part brilliantly as Batman's loyal friends and even guiding his conscience at times. And Maggie Gyllenhaal well i felt that her acting and role as Rachel Dawes was very good and the chemistry between her Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent was excellent, far better than Katie Holmes in her role in Batman Begins.Now the last thing i will comment on is Heath Ledger. Now the day i found out that he would play The Joker in the Dark Knight, i was laughing. Thinking to myself how will the actor from the god awful 'Knights Tale' ever play one of Hollywood's greatest villains. I was certain that the film would suffer because of his acting and was sure that he would not even amount anywhere near to Jack Nicholson's fantastic portrayal as the Joker in the original Batman (1989). Well after watching the film i can gleefully say that i was proved very, very wrong. Its not very often that i watch a film and go WOW, thats great acting. I did it for Daniel Day Lewis after There Will Be Blood and Gangs OF New York and most importantly for My Left Foot, and even did it for Al Pacino after Godfather 2 and Scent of a Woman. But Heath Ledger's performance as the Clown Prince of Crime is truly legendary. He portrays Joker as the sadistic, psychotic, cold blooded killer he really is. Now its a pity that Heath Ledger died after this film was made because his acting in this would've made him a superstar among Hollywood actors.Another thing that i thought Ledger did brilliantly was the maniacal laugh that Joker has. Now that laugh is one of the Joker's key characteristics and Ledger's laugh was truly spine tingling. Now it is also due to the fact the the screenplay is so good and the script is so good that Ledger's acting shines, but at the end of the day you can have a great script but also have terrible acting, but in this case Heath Ledger has certainly proved to me that his acting capabilities are very strong. There would not be any justice in the world if Ledger does not get the Oscar for his acting, because it really needs to be seen to be believed. Now i'm not just praising his acting and saying he deserves and Oscar because he has died, no, no no. I truly believe that his acting was mind blowingly chilling and perfect, and the best acting you'll see in 2008.Overall I feel that The Dark Knight is the best comic book adaption ever and will be talked about for years to come. Its extremely hard to find a legendary film these days what with all of the terrible sequels and remakes, but here is a prime example of a truly legendary film and one of the best sequels in history. Truly a mesmerising film from start to finish, and nothing short of an Epic.",1
"I didn't know what to make of the film before I saw it. It looked cool, but Brad Pitt was in it and his acting usually is, well, wooden at best.Then I saw it.I gotta say, this is a great film. It's got everything: action, plot,crazies, bombs, acting. Even Brad Pitt puts in a good performance. Made me respect him as the pretty boy actor he is instead some guy who just looks good to all the chicks in the land. Ed Norton is the main man, though. He teams up with Pitt to form a club where beating the living (blank) out of each other is heaven. Every guy who seems run down and lost in the world and sees it wants to join. Soon they have a legion of guys at their disposal. that's when Tyler (Pitt) starts to put into action a series of terrorist actions against the city of Los Angelos. Meanwhile, Ed Norton's character is getting phased out more and more as it goes on and he starts to feel left out. From there all heck breaks loose. With many twists and turns, Fight Club keeps you on your feet and, at least for myself, Kept me wanting to know more and more what was going to happen. I've seen this film a dozen times now and it still hasn't lost anything. Go check it out NOW!!! And remember, the first rule of fight club is :WE do NOT talk about fight club!!!!ONWARD!!!!",1

"I must confess I was somewhat skeptical going into Dark Knight regarding Heath Ledger's performance. I had heard a lot of the hype prior to seeing the film and I figured much of the hype surrounding his performance was related to and out of sympathy for his tragic death. My skepticism was unwarranted as his performance was fantastic.The film was fun and suspenseful. It is a good film, but for me there were too many contrived scenes for it to be truly a great film.Great films can come in all shapes and sizes, but the ones I find profound don't hit you over the head in an effort to be profound.Yes, Dark Knight addresses some good issues, but it does so in such an unsubtle manner that it disrupted my suspension of disbelief. For example, the passengers of the two ships deciding whether or not to blow up the other ship to ensure their survival. In watching this sub-drama unfold, the first thing that came to my mind was the unbelievable incompetence of the authorities in allowing the two major ships to be filled to the brim with explosives. The next thing that came to mind was that I was watching a variation on some kind of Lifeboat exercise. I give the writers and directors credit for trying to make this more than just an action thriller, but for me it just was not credible.I also found Harvey Dent's rapid fall/transformation into Two-Face somewhat somewhat lacking in credibility as well.I would recommend this film as a must watch as it is mostly very well done and Heath Ledger steals the show as the Joker, but no way is it is a top 10 film of all time.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is truly one of the best movies ever made. With picture perfect performances all around. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies you can watch and re-watch and re-watch and love it each time. The sad part is it didn't get the fame and Oscars it deserved.7 Oscar Nominations and no wins does not do justice to the quality of this movie.The Shawshank Redemption is a must buy and keep to watch again and again. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's characters as Andy Dufresne and Red respectively, take them to a whole new level, which in-turn suck the viewer into their world of highs and lows.If this movie isn't a part of your collection already get it now.",1
"I doubt any film could have lived up to the hype surrounding this one. I thought ""The Dark Knight"" was about the best action film ever to hit the screen, and ""Memento"" a clever puzzle that engaged.""Inception"" has the look of a great film, but it's about as heavy-handed as any film I can think of. We're constantly stopping to hear a long explanation of the new rules of dream logic that got us to...something that isn't at all dream-like. And by the time we hit the slope on skis it seemed so weighted down by mundane ""action,"" I lost all interest.The first 30 minutes or so when you don't have your footing on what's going on are the most satisfying. But once the explanations start (and they never approach the cleverness of ""Memento"") tedium sets in.Logic is abandoned: Who says that if you die in a dream you never wake up? Why is one person's projection lethal and another's isn't? How can an ""architect"" of one person override another's? On and on.... And ""just because"" really isn't a satisfying answer for a film that purports to be a sensation.Visually, it can draw gasps. Intellectually, it's just plain silly. And the entire length works against any excitement. I'd have voted for one less dream within a dream.There's a 1962, 28 minute short film, ""La Jetée"" which is likely the source for Nolan's idea. It devastates the viewer with much less fuss than all this $160 million dollar rattling and rolling.",1
"... am I the only one who liked Batman Begins a lot more? Why does this one always get all the attention? I think the action sequences are not filmed very well and the movie could have a been shorter maybe? Heath is the bomb, though. Very very good movie, but top ten of all time, no way. Peace.",1
"The thing about making a movie is that it presents to the filmmaker the delicious opportunity to plant an idea in the viewer's subconscious, bypassing cognition and appealing directly to the subconscious through emotion-evoking symbolism. The idea of a subconscious was first proposed by Freud, who argued that it acted as a sort of ""referee"" or super ego between those things the reptile brain tells us to do and those things society tells us to do.Perhaps no man came to understand the implications of Freud and how his notions of the subconscious might be exploited for the purposes of creating propaganda better than Ernest Dichter, a Vienna-trained psychologist who became very famous for applying persuasive symbolism into television commercials. Among Dichter's more notable achievements was suggesting to the Betty Crocker Company that when a woman bakes a cake, she is subconsciously procreating, and that the act of pulling a cake from the oven was equivalent, on a subconscious level, to taking a baby from the womb. Dichter suggested to the executives at Betty Crocker that they should require that an egg be personally added to their cake mixes so that, when baking a cake, a woman would be offering her man a symbol of her fertility.Are you laughing? So did the executives at Betty Crocker. All the way to the bank. As did the executives at Ford, who agreed with Dichter that men treat sedans as wives and convertibles as mistresses. While much of what Freud thought about personality and motivation turned out to be bogus, the one thing that continues to stand up to the test of time is Freud's notion of dreaming and the meaning of symbols in dreams. Symbolic imagery is used so frequently today in films, television and commercials that we process the meanings routinely. We know, for example, that the fireworks exploding behind that scantily-clad Victoria's Secret Model are not really fireworks. We process their true meaning emotionally and intuitively through a process the psychologists call the ""peripheral route to persuasion."" Filmmakers are very aware of the peripheral route to persuasion and use it to feed us propaganda on a regular basis. Most of the time we don't mind because it is propaganda we agree with, such as we should treat our families better or be more concerned about the disadvantaged and poor. But what about the more controversial filmmakers? Isn't Michael Moore, for example, attempting to plant in the minds of his audience the notion that capitalism is inherently flawed because it is based on greed and heartlessness? What if the filmmaker could bypass the whole process of making a movie and just hook up some keen electronic gadget to himself and another person, crawl into his or her subconscious and plant the idea in the deepest, darkest part? That is the premise of Inception. While on the surface the movie is about crawling into dreams and planting ideas, it could easily be about movie making itself, because in the end the character Cobb and the director Christopher Nolan are in the same business. In that respect, this may well be Nolan's most personal film.While some have compared this movie to 2001: A Space Odyssey, I think Inception would make a great complement to a double feature together with The Stunt Man (1980). Inception borrows the ""film within the film"" concept, puts it on steroids and applies it to dreams. In the end, it could easily be a movie about making movies that are themselves about movies.For those of you insisting on explanations, yes, I think the whole damned thing was a dream. But, like Mulholland Drive and Lost it's a death dream in which Cobb is working out the regrets and sins of his life. What I saw was Cobb's purgatory, and by the end of the movie Cobb's subconscious was able to work out a lot of issues, and he got closer to heaven. Or maybe it was just another movie with an intentionally-ambiguous ending designed to provoke us. What worries me is what Nolan might have planted in my head while I was watching it.",1
"Totally Intense, Totally Awesome! Disempowered? Disenfranchised? Live vicariously through this film. You will think about this film for days...  Honest! This is how movies should be made.",1
"The first half of the movie is good and presents great, progressive ideas and theories but then the second half shows how dumb people are and how, in general, humans mess things up, a la (in essence) ""this is why we can't have nice things"".",1
"Batman is one of my favorite DC heroes ever. I've seen the old Batman movies such as the Batman 1989 and Batman Returns and so are the bad Batman movies that I am not going to mention. But this movie, The Dark Knight, has kicked it! From beginning to end it's awesome. There was no other superhero movie that has been as realistic as this one. Sure, I do love some Marvel movies like The Avengers and Captain America The Winter Soldier and they were actually good but those movies lacked the realism. In conclusion, The Dark Knight is a ""must watch"" movie. Especially to those DC fans out there.",1
"I have to admit that when I saw the Dark Knight I was totally blown away! The movie exhales quality in every field. It is the battle of good against evil at its best! I do not think I have ever watched a better action movie than this one...and it is not only about action. It is a deep character analysis and after watching it, you will end up wondering : Finally, who was the actual villain? Should chaos emerge some time in history, in order to reset the balance of existence? Acting is superb. Christian Bale delivers the goods as always...Michael Cane always a great figure, no matter what role he is playing, Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal are very convincing. But the whole show belongs to Heath Ledger. The man has made such an in-depth analysis of his character that you actually believe he is the personalization of evil...he is perfect! He is great...probably the best villain in a movie so far. What a loss! Even if you do not like such movies, you should go watch this guy's acting. He should be nominated for an Academy Award, no doubt about it!Direction is top notch. Christofer Nolan is great in his art. The sequels are breathtaking, the sceneries are fantastic, you feel like he gets the best from his actors and that is, in my opinion, the best skill a director should have. Thanks for this great movie Mr. Nolan! All in all it is the best action movie that has ever been materialized, IMHO. You miss the world if you don't go watch it!",1
I saw this movie when I was young and I am writing this review almost after 10 years watching that. Still I can remember the screenplay and the patience of the mastermind which succeed in the end. Very good plot and acting of the main actor as well should be praised without doubt. Though the movie is little bit lengthy comparing with the movies nowadays but I hope someone will not get bored while watching it. A 'must watch' movie.,1
"This film had a disjointed beginning, an excellent middle and a muddled ending. The fight scenes and chase sequences were choppily edited and Christian Bale lost way too much muscle for this outing - who wants a skinny Batman? The overall experience felt like watching a hastily edited version of a much longer film. It makes me think that there may very well be a longer director's cut offered when the DVD is released? I cannot go along with the majority and vote this film the number one movie of all time. It is too early to tell and this film deserves repeated viewings before making that judgment. A good film certainly, but not perfect.",1
The only superhero movie so far where I didn't hate even a little aspect of the movie.,1
"I deeply believe that this is the masterpiece of modern cinematography. I am not to say whether this is the best movie of all time because it is more fitted to these times and way of living but without a doubt the viewer is left fully satisfied by the magnificent direction, plot and acting. Nolan sets a stunning atmosphere inside carefully designed dream worlds while manages to narrate the action and family story of the protagonist as they were totally necessary, interrelated parts of the complete puzzle.The most important attribute of this film is that it is going to make you think. You are not to miss a line if you want to keep up with the plot, but I believe that the really breathtaking fact is that this film elegantly depicts the dangers of our modern society, i.e. the need of modern man to build imaginary worlds (in front of a PC or a game console screen) in order to escape from his non-satisfying life. Simply brilliant!",1
"i saw this like 3 years ago or something like that and it was the best movie i ever seen, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were great in it. I think David Fincher is a great director and Se7en was a great movie too so if your looking for something to rent, rent fight club",1
"OK , first thing , no way this movie should be averaging 9.1 , don't get me wrong its a good movie , but it sure ain't a classic. If you have seen any other Batman film , then you know exactly what you are in for , no surprises , predictable storyline. All the acting is OK , Heath Ledger is OK as the Joker , no better than Nicholson all them years ago and indeed no better than Cesar Romero in the original TV show. Christian Bale is fine , apart from the stupid voice he puts on when he is Batman , reminds me of Jim Carey's alias ""Hank"" in Me Myself and Irene. I don't want to be too negative because its a decent movie , but some folk just get carried away and it puts a skew on the whole rating for the film. Go and watch it , I guarantee you will enjoy it , then come back here and give it an honest rating , and that is what this site is all about.",1
"An ultimate master-piece. The best movie ever made. Period.There are movies, there are great movies and then at the end of the tunnel, there is SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Initially, a failure at box office but a winner of hearts and emotions forever. This movie changes life, it helps people get eternal hope. The strength of the movie is its connection with the audience. One can easily relate with a scene or a character or a moment in this gem of a movie.Shawshank Redemption is a movie which strikes a chord with all its viewers. Two words that define this movie are: Hope and Friendship. It shows the ever-lasting bonding of 2 men and their journey together in the confines of a prison. The simplicity of the movie is admirable. The scenes are believable, the struggles are realistic and one gets attached to the pain and sufferings of Andy Dufresne. All the characters have done an incredible work. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) carry the movie and are outstanding to say the least.Whenever you feel sad or upset, whenever you need hope or whenever you want some will to overcome the greatest obstacle, Shawshank Redemption will uplift you in ways that just cannot be simply described in words. It will touch your soul and leave you mesmerized, captivated and wanting for more. You will definitely identify something very personal in your own life.I personally use the quotes in this movie in my real life. They help me whenever I feel depressed. 1.Fear can keep you prisoner, Hope can set you free. 2.Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. 3.Get busy living, or get busy dying. 4.On the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.It is my all-time favorite. I have watched it more than 30 times and still the charm fails to fade away. Every time it leaves me spellbound with its sheer brilliance. It gets better with every showing. The movie connects with you, it moves you and most importantly, it gives you HOPE!!!",1
This is by far my favourite film ....I can watch it anytime and it brings out the same emotions I felt when I watched it for the first time....a film par excellence with immaculate performances....must watch !!!,1
"The movie is really well made , everyone needs to watch it .",1
"I've seen this movie once, but I've seen its make-up a hundred times elsewhere; Fox and Alfred introducing Batman to new gadgets in James Bond; 'unstoppable force meeting immovable object' (haven't heard that before); semi-trailers and high speed car chases through big city underpasses (that's creative, which 'Die Hard' or 'Terminator' did they clip that from); high-flying cable wiring and and bombs on hostages (how unique), my home town of Hong Kong in the story line (every second action film does that now); and, Joker standing down Batman in the street (seen that before in the first Batman!).And, as for the pre-Oscar chat for Heath Ledger; well, any reasonable actor can play a half-baked idiot, just ask Tom Hanks (Gump) and Russell Crowe (Beautiful Mind). Nicholson was head and shoulders a better Joker; as was Tommy Lee (Two-Face).This movie will set box office record from now until doomsday; my burning question is why? It's not that good and its all been done before.",1
"This movie can be miss construed as a perpetuator of violence, but the movie is a tough showcase of manhood, where men take it out on each other all in the name of the thrill of adrenalin. It takes a while to get into loving Fight Club, but the moment you are hooked, it will be one movie you will like to own. The movie showcased a good cinematography, as most of the events in the movie took place at night, the director and the cinematographer had to make the best of extra florescent lights, and using locations that had well lighted street lights.Fight Club is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The film was directed by David Fincher (Seven (1995) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Franklin (2008) both also stared Brad Pitt) the movie has an unnamed narrator which is played by Edward Norton. The narrator (Norton) tells us about his life, we learn about his white collar job and how he lived an everyday routine life which he got tired of, took break off the routine he started something that became so big that he himself could not control.The Unnamed narrator started a club with his new friend from a bar Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the club featured men taking it out on each other, fighting bare fist just for the thrill.The club grew and became a cross country thing, with Tyler and the unnamed narrator seen as the club presidents and they take turns going around to see that the club is well run, in the various locations.Prepping up for their roles both Pitt and Norton took lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling and soap making. Pitt further went ahead to Chip some of his tooth so as not to look too perfect. Filming lasted over 138 days with over 300 scenes, the fight scenes were heavily choreographed with the actors going all out, so as to make it look more realistic.Here is a movie that I highly recommend you get the DVD, but I do have to warn you that it does posses extreme violence, as we see men go bear fist fight with one another, but the movie twist ending is far more captivating than the violence that at the end you are more glad with the way the movie is taking form than you are worried with the intense fight scenes.www.lagsreviews.com",1
"Brilliant script and amazing film line.Along with the wonderful actors, the direction of the film is a+.",1
"Kindly watch this movie,superb storyline and content i love this movie",1
"Going in to this film I had no real idea what to expect of this movie as I purposely avoided reading all reviews of the movie where the plot was revealed or discussed. I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw.This is not a film with excessive violence without context as some critics would like to have us believe. Among other things the film makes a none too subtle comment about the fabric that make up our human existence and the fact that sometimes pain is the only aspect of life that seems real to any of us.Instead of condoning the behaviours in the film the director (in what is perhaps Fincher's best work) continually emphasizes the relationship between what the characters are feeling and what the characters are doing. We see vividly the conflict within Edward Norton's character as the film progresses and we are effectively drawn into the movie taking each turn with him.The pacing of the movie is maintained superbly throughout and together with the direction, cinematography, and dialogue serve to create a movie packed with enough surprise to entice any true movie fan.The acting throughout is excellent with excellent performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Meatloaf. All of the actors turn in performances worthy of comparison to their best work to date.I truly hope that the greatness of this movie is not sullied by over analysis of it's violent content (Natural Born Killers certainly was) as it reaches into far deeper realms than the surface would immediately suggest.Rating: A",1

AMAZING MOVIE. This is easily one of the best movies ever made. Totally awesome in every single way. Just... watch it already. You won't regret it.,1
"Putting yourself mentally where no one can get to you mentally. Now that's something to pull off for ourselves in a daily life habit. The pressures in a prison are a great deal more concerning than a day to day grunge and nose to the grind stone. Timothy Robbins does amazing in his role in this Movie and the support of friend made of Morgan Freemans character, solid. It really had me pulled in from beginning to end. getting more review lines in can give me an opportunity to be chatty, sure. But sometimes a movie is just a must see. The less you say. The simplistic thought of conveying there is always something more found the second time around. There's much to catch.

"Is this life? If everything is realistic, what is fake? Am I, in a dream? The concept of this film is excellent, take the idea of dream interpretation and turn it into a film, add some Nolan-style plot and some blockbuster visuals and Bam(!), you have this glorious film.A little complaint before beginning this review is that Zimmer's music becomes a bit too loud at certain points. However, there is rarely dialogue so it isn't a problem. * Dicaprio, Page, and Cotillard star as the main three characters of the film and all three of them give excellent performances.Page's dream sequence in the early portion of the movie is fascinating and I wish they spent more time dwelling on what can happen in a dream than go quickly into the action in the later sequences.The plot thickens, almost a bit too much and then it goes back to the guns and explosions seen in a blockbuster. It somewhat relies a bit too heavily on these guns in the next dream sequence but thankfully it goes back to the plot. I won't say much more as I don't want to spoil anything. Speaking of which **: * Also, his score is excellent, ""Time"" being one of his best pieces, which is saying a lot.** In terms of the ending, I do not think he was. See, no spoilers and I gave my opinion.",1
"It's simply one of the best movies off all time. All is perfect: Screenplay, cinematography,acting,production...The performances are of the highest quality- every character is portrayed in such a way as to enhance the authenticity of the film and give it true life. The most complete movie that I've ever seen. I really recommend this movie to anyone. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. Once again, in my opinion,this is simply the best movie ever made,with so many moments burned forever in my memory.... I'll stop it there, but that's all you need to know. An absolute masterpiece.",1
"well, sir.. this is not something to be interested in reading it, but here I am. I have to say this. frankly watching such a movie while facing insomnia is not the best thing to do but i did it anyway. don't we all have insomnia in a day or another? maybe always? don't we wait until the sun rises to ask ourselves: ""Did I sleep? have I even slept? since when?"" and now i'm fortunately sure that my perspective about every single movie would change. nothing would stay -or stayed - as it is before the fight club. that is not a simple or even a good movie, it is way much more as I know. this kind of movies is what we consider as history, present and future.",1
"What can I say, one of the best films of all time. I strongly recommend it.",1
"Wow. Thats just about all there is to say... WOW.That movie was SO INTENSE, but BRILLIANT! I absolutely loved it. Heath Ledger outdid himself. I can't say I was a fan of his before this, but his performance as the Joker had me wanting to give him a standing ovation in every scene. It was awesome. Christian Bale continued to impress me. His voice as Batman is always the perfect throwback to the older films, and his gadgets just keep getting better. Alfred, as always, is the wise old Yoda-type character. His advice seems to be what can change the course of the movie. The one thing that wasn't quite up to snuff was Rachel Dawes. Maggie Gyllenhaal just looked too dowdy in my opinion to be the love interest of Batman. Katie Holmes had this simple, down-home, quiet prettiness that was rather endearing. Maggie just didn't have it. Morgan Freeman, as usual, was amazing. You just can't top him. All in all, I loved it. The story that they elaborate on to show you more of 'how it happened' was perfect. 10 outta 10 here.",1
"If you haven't seen it, you might say, ""Why does a batman movie have such a high rating?"" Let me STOP YOU RIGHT THERE! This is NOT A BATMAN MOVIE. This is a disturbing, dark, horror-like reinterpretation of ""batman"". You could completely care less about the dark knight character, and even forget about him sometimes when Heath Ledger comes on the screen as The Joker. A crazy man who paints his face and carves smiles on his victims with a razor sharp knife. Never have I ever been more impressed by any acting performance than this. Heath Ledger is the scariest, creepiest, craziest, murderous villain in all cinematic history. No offense Christian Bale, but Heath Ledger(Joker) is the reason this is one of the greatest movies of all time. The Joker is the reason you see a 9.0 in front of you. He is scary as f***. Twisting a children's comic into a horror movie. I was never into comics, superhero's, especially not Batman. This movie blew my mind. You are seriously wasting your time on this planet not watching it. Just like you are if you've never seen It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's like trying apple pie, you HAVE to. (personally not a big fan of apple pie, just used that because it's a saying, so replace ""apple pie"" with something you think is delicious that everyone has to try.) Then add this movie to your list. If you think you don't want to watch it because you don't like super hero movies, you are misled, and sadly mistaken.",1

"Powerful movie. It's surprising that the title of this movie directs you to think that it will be kind of action with fights only, but in fact is something more complicated and with a powerful message in the end. This movie is the best movie I ever saw and I strongly recommend everyone to see it as soon as possible, I'll guarantee you won't be disappointed.",1
"Where to begin. A movie of this caliber deserves nothing less than a 10. Any movie that can make you question everything that has happened up until the final 15mins. of it is a movie of excellence. The one liners that become important to the plot anywhere from 20mins. to an hour after they've been said the multiple personality innuendo's throughout the movie that make you think 'What the hell did he just say' keeps you interested. When you hear these things it makes you want to rewind the movie but you decide not to because you hope that what he said will be explained in a few minutes. The next thing you know the movies almost over, you have all these lines and questions in your head that you want explained and answered but you so involved in the movie that by now you don't care if they are because all your really thinking about is how fast 'Project Myhem' progressed or why they had to shoot Bob in the head why not in the leg he didn't hurt anyone or do anything wrong all he did was remodel a shop a little. This movie has all the elements funny lines, questionable speeches, insightful knowledge into real life that you may have never thought of. You can never go wrong with a movie that makes you wonder.",1
"""This is a movie that a man must see."" Everyone says that. But the mere distinction between sex makes the film narrow. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" broke the limitation of man is almost full of incredible, full of warm tone, and the film's theme is ""the greatest hope"". But when we encountered that prison like Shoschenk imprisoned soul free, we are helpless old Brook, frustrated Reed, or the wisdom of Andy? To use wisdom, to trust in hope, and to face the fear of fear, to defeat it? Classic movies are classic because they are doing the same thing - let you appreciate the beauty of hope from a different angle.",1
"""Fight club"" is a dark, fast-paced movie that audiences don't have much time to think about, but unlike other films of its kind, each of David fincher's quick cuts serves a unique purpose besides keeping the audience from getting bored. The most thrilling thing about the whole movie is not what the movie is about, but how David fincher pushes the audience into the mind of the narrator ""me"", forcing the audience to feel ""me"" in the real world. It also opens up another possibility for storytelling in the film world",1
"At first i thought that hype would ruin it and make it 'Blair Witch Project: Part 2' (btw, i do know there is a 2nd BWP movie). But no, it actually turned out to be surprisingly VERY good. For me it didn't really have the feel of a Batman movie but more a film about The Joker. Which was an amazing choice because Heath Ledger is just an AMAZING actor! It's a shame he died, he should have won an Oscar! I hope something big and amazing will be devoted to his name. Christopher Nolan has made a truly amazing film and status as a legendary Director.Another film that is/was extremely hyped up, WALL.E I hope to see this soon and to come to a similar conclusion. Hype can ruin or make a film.This is definitely the best film of the year, if not the film of the century.10/10",1
"It took me a while to get around to seeing this movie, and when I started watching it I realized that I had no idea what it was about. I had never read a review of any sort. I'd just heard it was a mind trip from the guy who did Memento, and that was the reason I wanted to watch it.While this isn't a movie where not knowing what it's about would really heighten the experience the way it would with something like The Truman Show, I would say the ideal way to watch it is to stop reading reviews and just watch it. I'm also not going to say a thing about the story.That being said, this is an amazing movie. It has a fairly original premise, it is exciting and suspenseful and intricately plotted. The special effects are amazing. The characters are well thought out (except, perhaps for one characters inexplicable decision to get more immersed than necessary or advisable) and its mix of psychology and pondering on the nature of reality is fascinating.It's the sort of movie that, at the end, makes you wonder, ""did that really all make sense?"" Fortunately the website screenrant has a wonderful analysis that makes it clear that yes, this really does all hold together pretty well.A beautifully designed, extravagantly clever, wildly entertaining movie. Watch it.",1
"I feel impressed by the movie,especially the story and the acting of actors.",1
"Is a very interesting movie with a suggesting trama, I recommend it to everyone",1
"This is the most awesome movie I've ever watch in my entire life, I love Batman as a cartoon character since I was a child, but bringing this into real life movie, I was speechless.I watch this on my personal DVD about hundreds times already, I still have this on my room, the posters, etc. I love to watch this with family, friends and classmates, I even watch this with my girlfriend long time ago, then with my wife later on and in the present when my child grow up, we will watch this together with my own family. I hope they will like it too, since they are close to me, I doubt that they really love this one.Love to watch this again anytime I have time.",1
"*** This review may contain spoilers *** Heath, as The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.",1
"I would have to say that Nolan has done something that no other Batman film director could ever do - make a darker film than Tim Burton. Tim's over-the-top circus-like direction, while albeit dark, isn't anywhere near as dark and gritty as this film is.Let's start with the Joker first off. Ledger has outclassed Nicholson in this role. This isn't the prim and proper Joker that Nicholson displayed - this Joker is a force of nature that plays by absolutely no rules except his own twisted moral code. He cares more about chaos and mayhem more than he would ever care about money or fame. He lives off the fear of the populace. Nicholson's obsession with the Batman had more to do with him creating the Joker, versus a twisted and depraved fascination with Batman being the symbol of hope for a doomed city. Turning the Joker into a bona fide terrorist fits today's post-911 world like a glove in terms of creating a visceral reaction within the audience. Nicholson's Joker was more preoccupied with settling personal vendettas than being a terrorist, which means that his Joker isn't near as fascinating.Likewise, Two-Face in this film is more in line with Nicholson's Joker this time around. His existence in this film is purely about personal vendettas, but if there is one complaint I have about this film, is that he's largely overshadowed by the Joker. Again, someone who has personal vendettas unfortunately isn't near as interesting or compelling as someone who's unpredictable and destroys things just for the hell of it. While I do agree that having Harvey Dent in the film was a good idea to move Batman's story along, I would be loathe to say that Two-Face is the star attraction here.All the stars here seem to know what's at stake with this film, so they give it their all. Even with Heath Ledger out of the equation, the performances are fine. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman really do take advantage of their supporting roles in the film, and use the limited screen time they have to make an impact. Christian Bale does another fine job as the freewheeling playboy as well.Lastly, one cannot say enough about the special effects. The effects in this film rival all other superhero films. An IMAX camera was even used for certain scenes, heightening the impact even more.Even if you like the 1989 Batman film, I highly recommend you see this one. It out-Burtons Burton.",1
I think that this film has a brilliant idea throughout it and that it was executed brilliantly,1
"The first rule of Fight Club is that we don't talk about Fight Club. That's all you need to know. Honestly, your better off going into this movie not knowing what it's about, especially because there's a lot going on and saying anything about the plot means spoilers. Besides, being surprised is more fun. To start, the performances are fantastic. Brad Pitt once again proves why he's such a famous actor, and that's because he's extremely talented. His character is very likable, and yet there's still a level of depth to him and his acting that brings humanity and realism to his character. Edward Norton is fantastic, and again, his character is very real and filled with depth thanks to said performance. The writing is pretty great. The dialogue is realistic, engaging, and often funny. In fact, this movie is very funny. I found myself laughing much harder than I expected throughout the entirety of this movie. The way this story is told is very interesting. There's just enough of one idea or concept before it moves on to the next part of the story, yet every previous part is still a very evident part of the movie, and it still plays a major role. It's not just shrugged off and forgotten about until the end, it's still important. The overall presentation of this movie is fantastic. David Fincher made some very good choices throughout the entire movie, especially towards the end. This is just further proof that Fincher is one of the greatest directors we have right now. The concept is fantastic. How many movies have we actually gotten like this? Not many, if not none. And yet, it's not so out there that it doesn't make sense, it makes complete sense, yet it's unique and original. It's amazing to see the whole plot progress from beginning to end too, to see how everything changes. I went into this movie knowing almost nothing. One thing I did know was the twist ending, unfortunately. And still, it pulled it off fantastically and still managed to surprise me. Once again, Fincher does a great job with this. Even the soundtrack is great, heck, the opening credits are probably the best I've ever seen. It's got this weird animation going on in the background with fun, upbeat music playing as the names of those involved display across the screen. It kept me awake and interested, and it's rare that I get interested simply by watching the opening credits. I don't think that's ever happened, actually. Overall Fight Club is amazing. Everything about it is excellent, the acting, the characters, the writing, the presentation, the concept, the twist, the soundtrack. Everything. For a 139 minute movie it surprises me with it's severe lacking of a single dull moment. In the end I would highly recommend this movie. It's one of the best I've seen all year.",1
"Inception is an amazing film but you must be careful to understand some connections.Because it has a story about dreams that requires the audience to stay awake.I think that the fiction of the film may be the future of a technology.If it is possible, people have the opportunity to take pleasure in life.Thanks to this technological development, capacity of idea develops.But if this idea is not mounted well, the hazards can occur.I can estimate the money spent for the film because the scenes are incredibly realistic and plot of the film is very connected to reality.Some scenes affected me very much like car scenes, explosions, snow-skiing and emotional moments with a dying father and son..Director used an original idea to make an original film. He wanted us to question the reality of Cobb and wanted us to question our own realities, our own dreams. I can say that Leonardo DiCaprio captured a second peak of his career thanks to this film. Because it is possible to say that I admired the successful performance of him in this film. There is not a lot of background to the story and some viewers may be critical of this fact. I did not have a problem with it. You must take your brain into the cinema and you can not leave your sense of reality at home. It is the only way you will be able to completely understand director's world and what he is trying to achieve. When considered as a general, I admired writer's imagination and you should watch this film at the cinema to enjoy visual production.",1
"what a narration..???,One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair.",1
"What a brilliant movie! the reason it stands apart is because it has removed all the supernatural element and made the universe a more believable one. it continues to portray the struggle batman goes through while being challenged by the Joker not just physically but psychologically. Mind blowing performances by the protagonist, Christian Bale, and the antagonist, Heath Ledger. A superhero can be as good as its villain and this movie proves just that",1
"I saw this movie for the first time a year ago. In those days I was browsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked #2 in the top 250. That was very weird for me because I never heard about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before. So I decided to go and rent it immediately. After watching the movie I was positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""! Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top 250 and the wake-up call!",1
"David Fincher is one of the best directors in Hollywood today. This is his finest film.Based on the best selling book of the same name, the movie starts with the narrator,Edward Norton initially a nameless, boring drone leading a shallow, meaningless life as just another cog in the great corporate wheel. He spends his time buying sofa-sets and basically indulging in the huge facade that is today's materialistic and fake society. As he puts it: ""We used to read pornography, now it's the 'Horchow Collection'.""But he isn't satisfied with his life. There's always this nagging feeling, deep-down, a hint of discontent. This manifests into his psyche and he becomes an insomniac. Seeking medication, he discovers therapy groups, and there, on the pretext of a terminal disease or an addiction, he cries. He doesn't really know why he crying. Maybe its about the hollowness, and the utter futility of it all. This daily discharge helps him sleep. Until, that is, chain-smoking, messed-up Marla Singer starts coming to his therapy sessions for a similar purpose. Seeing another 'tourist' there bursts the happy he finds himself in and insomnia creeps back into his life. Then he meets Tyler Durdan and he's drawn, like everyone else, to his magnetic personality. One night, on a whim, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. He complies, and thus begins fight club. Fight club transformed into a nocturnal activity in a basement where men shed the inhibitions laid down by society, and release themselves. That's all that I'm going to reveal here.But let's talk about Tyler Durdan. For it's not possible to talk about fight club and not talk about Tyler Durdan, a character who was recently named the greatest movie character of all time by a magazine, beating out competition from the likes of Darth Vader, Hannibal Lecter, The Joker, John Rambo etc. Brad Pitt outdoes himself in portraying just about the best example of an alpha-male you'll ever see. Tyler epitomises the saying about Bond (""Man want to be him, Women want to sleep with him"") more than any Bond. The rugged Daniel Craig, the cool suave and sophisticated Brosnan and Connery all fall flat in front of his sheer charisma. His laid-back, casual attitude tells of a man who has not a care in his life. The conviction with which speaks tells of a man who's got it all figured out. His radical thoughts and ideas tell of a fearless man, not afraid to go against society. And the small, condescending smile he occasionally afforded the narrator tells of a man who knows just how superior he is to everyone. Tyler Durdan acts the saviour of the society's repressed men and frees them from its clutches. Edward Norton too, does a brilliant job as the narrator, and his boring drawl as a narrative paradoxically draws you further in the movie. The narrator the quintessential modern man trying to find meaning who is swayed by forceful personality. The dialogues are smart and some of the lines have now achieved cult status and are often quoted to each other by today's hippys. The cinematography is completely in sync with the somewhat non-linear storyline and is so good that it somehow distracts most watching it for the first time (including me) from a very obvious truth which makes you feel really stupid afterwards. Because of this, Fight Club, has, for most of the stupid audience (which constitutes an incredibly large number of us) and also the ones who think they're too smart (the rest of us), a huge twist that leaves you gasping, adding to its excellent plot. In addition to the twist, the plot aptly puts a mirror to society. While the anti-consumerism propagated has been aptly covered by most reviewers, something that they missed was the movie showing how fickle and susceptible to propaganda the human population is, and who easily they get swayed in search of meaning. The film does tickle the fancies of many, despite the film's anarchistic messages being tempered down with wry humour. Fight club preaches about evolving beyond the endless pursuit of perfection by today's superficial society. Fight Club is about showing on your face what other people hide in their closets. Fight Club is about exposing the dirty underbelly that every household inevitably has. But it also preaches against taking its own ideas too extremely. But above all, it entertains. It is more than two hours of intense entertainment. For all those who haven't seen Fight Club, go watch it right now! 9/10",1
"Cobb was a reflection of all family men in this world. He would do anything, even being in a risky business that would cost him his life, just to be with his children. I really hope that Cobb did go home to his family and it was the reality. Because if he didn't it would be heartbreaking and the whole story is just sad to me. I would believe that it was the reality, for the sake of Cobb's happiness",1
"This is what Nolan is known for. Not only one of a kind but also the best. This is where our thinking stops, and his starts. This movie will bend your nerve cells and make you think so deep that you wished your subconscious could do it. Can watch as many times still make you doubt the reality. Wanna know if you are still awake or not,..? u know what to do.. ;)",1
"The most astounding aspect of the Dark Knight was the amount of intricacy, depth, and thought put into each dramatic scene. Each word was packed full of meaning and executed to near perfection by the cast.I'll give the example of the scene where Rachael and Harvey are both trapped within their own warehouses, each strapped to a bomb.Harvey thinks he knows Batman. He thinks he would save the lady, the damsel in distress; any self-respecting hero would make this obvious choice.Rachael knows better. Rachael knows Batman. She knows Bruce Wayne. She knows she won't be the one whom he is saving today. Throughout the scene she speaks what she knows are her final words with grim despair for her own life yet hope for the future, as this means Harvey will live on to serve Gotham.Harvey was guessing; Rachael knew. Harvey thought Batman was Gotham's hero. Rachael knew that Bruce would be Gotham's savior. Thats what makes this scene perfect.",1
"I found Inception to be quite the intelligent execution of script and storyline. Nolan executed it quite well and has a knack for being one of the few directors who is able to direct commercial fare with notable actors. He changed the face of comic book films with his take on The Dark Knight and has solidified his presence with Inception. I say this from a point of view noting that most studio films lack any quality. So Inception is a great movie, but mostly just by comparison to the lackluster quality of pics being made these days.The acting was not exceptional. I felt that DiCaprio basically walked through his performance. He has enough credibility to fall back on. The strongest performance I felt was given by Tom Hardy. I thought he stole every scene that he was in and always was left wanting to see more of him in the film. Overall, it was a great film. It was like Memento with 25 times the budget.",1
"Expected more from ""Inception"". It's not bad, but I didn't like it that much either. Maybe it's because I'm kind of slow :) ,but I thought the movie tried to be ""complex"" and the story actually got too confusing. Also too much James Bondean type of action for my taste. The main idea behind the film is great though, I'm sure it could have been much better. Maybe too much concern for special effects and couch potato type of entertainment. OK, Leonardo Di Caprio is a good actor, the movie innovates in some aspects. And It does make you think about the nature of dreams and so on, but not much more. Most of the time you're just trying to figure out what's happening and seeing explosions.",1
"Inception with a extra-ordinary imaginations that you can't even imagine. likewise the going into a dream was brilliant thought by Nolan. DiCaprio is always a spectacular actor on his own way. The film though was unbelievable let us through a world of thriller which given a kick always. The idea of going into dream and let know about the ideas of others was which wont work out in real. Anyways the casts all spelled the way of their acts. the most thrilled time was when Ariadne went to the basement in the elevator which gives a limbo of surprise.But the suspiciousness of Fischer was toped the film. The train in the downtown Los Angeles was a brilliant move by the director. Another thing in this movie i could hardly notice was the casts never over reacted for their play. I could possibly see in all the movies at least one cast will over react, in that way movie gets a 10.Sad thing was the film didn't won any academy or the Bafta ""disappointed"". The Fischer was followed with most anticipating thriller but finally gives us a failure. Finally Cobb enters into his homeland without any charges which is again easily predicted. Ariadne was too young to enter the Inception instead she proved her maturity. More like MATRIX which doesn't uses heavy machines spaceships or anything. The film rocked with its economical way and hit the spot most high.I personally enjoyed the film which was i dreaming about.Inception ""Dreamers choice"".",1
spoiler One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. . If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once. who can ever forget the scene under rain giving freedom a big big hug :),1
"This is without a doubt, the best film of the 90's.  Morgan Freeman is brilliant as Red, his story is just as compelling as Andy Dufrense's.  Only repeated viewings made me realise this.  Another oscar tragedy that Forrest Gump won best picture over this, typical USA USA carry on.  This story also proves Stephen King as a wonderfull writer and not just a one-dimensional horror novelist.  So heartwarming, great humour particularly from the head prison guard and the best, most bitter sweet revenge in any film I can think of.  A no questions asked 10/10.",1
"Although ""Inception"" is certainly an entertaining film, I suspect that Christopher Nolan's primary purpose in creating this labyrinthine and intriguing work of cinematic art was not entertainment. I believe Nolan wants to provoke our preconceived notions of reality and self-will and tease us with the idea that we can never be certain of the nature of reality_or our ability to conceive an idea wholly independently. The plot of this film is almost beside-the-point_that's not to say, however, that it isn't clever or exciting. It is in fact a complex tapestry of narrative layers and dreams within dreams, dreams that feature characters who engage in the legendary struggle between passion and reason. But the plot and the characters are there merely as tools that allow Nolan to examine his grand themes. I've seen this film just once, but I strongly suspect that a second viewing will yield a far more satisfying experience.",1
"This movie is just awesome because of the combination of some important stuff like action, mystery and imagination. Nowadays most of the film don't have that much of imagination in film and the best thing about film is mystery in mystery. Hell of suspense. The magic of Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as always. He take the film a extra ordinary level by from his acting skills and suspense personality.If you didn't watch the movie yet then go and see this movie first. #3 Important things about movie is 1-Action, Suspense & Imagination 2-Leonardo DiCaprio 3-Climax which will blow your mind..",1
"Adapted from Chuck Paulanuik's fantastic and original novel, the film is even better. Every performance is nigh on perfect and Fincher turns in what is possibly the most expert directorial performance in the history of cinema. Seriously. Films aren't supposed to be this good. It's not healthy.",1
"An amazing story, great cast and incredible acting. I saw this film for the first time this year, and have seen it twice more since.An incredible story, told extraordinarily well. Gripping, exciting and satisfying.What more is there to add? This film isn't top of the list of the highest rated movies on IMDb for nothing!If you haven't seen this movie, make it top of your list. If you have already seen it, it's probably about time you saw it again anyway, right?10/10",1
"For those who like a non stop action roller coaster, on the whole this movie should be highly enjoyable. From beginning to end it's deliberately fast paced, even confusing at times. As with most modern movie flicks you need to forget about the laws of physics. The Bat-Mobile and Bat-Cycle, and even Batman himself are great fun, but totally impossible of course :) The Joker's character is a perfectly crafted horror. He dominates the movie, partly because the film makers have given him seemingly unlimited energy to be everywhere at once, to easily bypass security everywhere, and an unexplained ability to command total loyalty from his henchmen who he consistently betrays.The mood is deliberately grim, focusing on the seedy underbelly of the world's largest city and how it bites back when threatened with extinction.In the first movie we saw Bruce Wayne create the Batman character as a symbol of hope for the tired and beaten-down populace. In this movie we see him ultimately sacrifice that symbol for what he believes to be a greater and more important one. That's what makes it such a dark movie. Although the ending is in true Hollywood style, good does not triumph over evil.The film is long, but the time passes quickly and whether you love it or just like it it is definitely worth seeing. Hope you enjoy it :)",1
"So this movie has been mega-hyped and I did see it on opening day. I enjoyed it, though I'm not sure I'd sit through it again. First, the positive points. There is nice eye-candy for the female movie-goer in Bale and Eckhart. The performances all around are stellar. Obviously, Ledger's Joker is amazing. I personally found it to be one of the best performances I've seen in an actor (this may be ironic but I found it as chilling as Nicholson's role in The Shining). He was superb and I found myself waiting for the scenes in which he would reappear. I also though Gary Oldman did some very nice work. His performance was restrained in the right places and emotionally wrought in others. Eckhart and Caine were really terrific in their roles as well. Freeman played the same character he always does and that was fine. Maggie Gyllenhaal was unwatchable. Horrible acting on a horribly written character. And I don't mean to be rude, but she is way too homely looking for the viewer to believe uber-hotties would be lusting after her. She was terrible.The negatives: The movie is way too long. I found it uncomfortably long. Bale's Batman voice grated on my nerves. I appreciate the intensity and artistic style of this movie, but it just wasn't a whole lot of fun. It was dark, heavy, brooding, and a bit depressing. Recommended but not loved.",1
"What can I say? If you want a movie that socks you in the face, throws you around the room and still takes you out to dinner, this is it!! It is a cinema must! You could never watch it anywhere else and have the same effect. The stunts and effects were out of this world, my breath was completely taken away, given back only to be taken away again. The twists of the story only fitted together at the end and if you watch it twice it would never have the same effect. Ed Norton, Brad Pitt (Mr Psycho) and Helena Bonham-Cater (shame about the hair) what more can I say?!!",1
"This is one of those rare films that is flawless! no matter how hard i try i cant seem to find anything wrong with it. it has a great script, great acting, and a feel good tone to it. Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins are great this film is a must see! This is truly one of the greatest films ever made! i highly recommend it to everyone! It also has pretty good cinematography and it feels real. You get lost in the story and it feels like you are apart of the story! This definitely deserved all of the awards that it received. Even though it has a long running time it still manages to run smoothly without any dull moments. Bravo!",1
"When i saw this movie ,I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director.The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener.The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks.i think this film is the best story ever told on film.I love this film.I watch this film 100 times.i will watch this movie more and more until i die.i also encourage my generation to watch this movie.Sometimes i share the story of this movie with my friends.then they watch it and became the fan of this movie.I want to give some credits to the director.",1
"At first I thought I would be bored by the Shawshank Redemption but when the film was over I was the complete opposite. The story was gripping, sad, and at some points even funny. The acting was perfect. If they had picked different actors I think they wouldn't have been able to pull it ...The Shawshank Redemption has three dimensional characters, great character development, acting, script, editing, twists, camera angles, directing, music and more. As always Morgan Freeman was awesome....Must watch movie.....Hello Friends,I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch the movie online....Highly recommended",1
"In this Christopher Nolan epic we saw Leonardo brilliantly portraying Cobb, a man who creates a dream within a dream. Also starring Nolans original cast typing for The Dark Knight trilogy includes Michael Caine, Ken Wattanabe, Cillian Murphy, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy. This is a truly mind blowing film supported with full commitment by Leonardo DiCaprio. To me, this is his greatest performance yet! With a knock out cast, and amazing effects this movie is truly a masterpiece! I also am a huge fan of Hans Zimmer's emotional soundtrack to the film. In this mind bending and heart wrenching thriller, DiCaprio never fails to shine on screen as Cobb. With Christopher Nolan being my favourite ever Director, this film is indeed a big treat on screen. With amazing performances by the supporting cast as well as DiCaprio, what could go wrong?",1
"an awesome movie i have ever seen... Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption is a novella by Stephen King, from his collection Different Seasons (1982), subtitled Hope Springs Eternal. It was adapted for the screen in 1994 as The Shawshank Redemption, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994, including Best Picture.[1] In 2009, it was adapted for the stage as the play The Shawshank Redemption.[2]The novella's plot line is heavily based on God Sees the Truth, But Waits by Leo Tolstoy. This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA. A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time.The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10",1
"The Shawshank Redemption {1994)Tag Line: Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You FreeDirector : Frank Darabont. Cast : Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman.This movie is considered to be one of the best movies ever made. Unfortunately, this movie was released in 1994, a year dominated by1. Forrest Gump ""A 6 Oscar Winner Romantic-Drama directed by 'Robert Jemeckis' starring one of the finest actors ever,'Tom Hanks' who undoubtedly deserved the Oscar. This film still stands in the list of top 50 Highest Grossing Movies with over $650million worldwide gross....* This is my all time favorite, i must say, being a big fan of Tom Hanks :D "" -----------2.

The film gained 7 Oscar/Academy Nominations, but hasn't one any.* This movie is Undoubtedly 'The Greatest Movie' to have not won an Oscar.* I cant say that, this is my most favorite, but definitely is one of my Top Favorites.* I think that this movie deserved 2 Oscars, one for The Best Picture of 1994 and another for Best Director.PS : If you cant understand this note or you think that this is just some sh*t, just try and watch the movie once. Then, you'll definitely agree with me. :)",1
"Three times.  That's how many times I went to see this movie.  I have to admit that I was not interested in it at first.  I read some reviews and I thought it was just one of those violent type of film.  The only reason I went to see this movie was I wanted to see Helena Bonham Carter.Then once the movie started, I knew right away I was making a right decision..  The movie makes you think about some simple things around you.. you know.. like, who you are and where do you stand in the society.But the first rule is that you do not talk about Fight Club... so I am not going to say more.For those of you who feels that you are not free to do whatever you want because of ...whatever.. this is the movie for you.It's time to wake up and look around .....Free yourself.",1
"For a child of the 80s, this was perfect...the antidote to feeling hemmed in and impotent. i'd imagine this movie is less appealing to today's college-aged boys, but maybe i'm wrong... i hope that masculine-ideal-related anxiety is becoming less pervasive... although the internet may prove otherwise. this film features a stellar soundtrack by the Dust Brothers, high replay-ability (thanks to lots of little Easter eggs) and a pretty dynamic cast... Helena Bonham Carter has disappointed me with every other feature I've seen her in. Go see it if only to learn the rules... and of course, for Brad Pitt as the biggest bad-ass since his role as Jeffrey Goines in 12 monkeys",1
"Inception is truly a world class movie directed by Christopher Nolan. Directing a movie like Inception is a tedious task for any film maker. But Nolan has handled the job perfectly.He has lined up a great cast.Dicaprio is the talisman of the movie around which the other characters are built.He had done an excellent job in Shutter island and has done it once again in inception. This movie is an edge of the seat thriller, that keeps its audience glued to their seats till the end, where you don't want to miss even a single scene.Music plays an important role in this movie.Great music from Hans Zimmer.Inception travels through both dream and imaginary worlds at the same time.Since dream has no boundaries, the idea is infinite.But Nolan has done excellently well to present it to the audience in the best way possible.Without mentioning Joseph Gordon-Levitt in my review would be inappropriate. He is breath taking in the scenes in the dream world. Inception is definitely going to be a strong contender for Oscar award in multiple categories.Inception is a delightful roller coaster ride that reaches its destination successfully.Definitely, a must watch.",1
"This movie is just the cinematic reflection of this quote. Despite being a movie of ""Drama"" genre, this has some quality thrilling moments and twists. You may feel bore at the start. But if you can survive the first part, you may witness the best movie of your life!This is not a thriller like Inception, Interstellar or Predestination. But to me the story and the screen play of this was better than those! Fight Club is one of the top 3 movies I've ever watched!Subtitles are strongly recommended.Happy watching.",1
"I am not kidding when I say it was the best movie I've seen in 10 years! The Joker was basically painted as a half-crazed homicidal terrorist. I found it chilling, disturbing, and relevant to today's issues. Although Heath Ledger was amazing as the Joker, the story / screenplay was phenomenal. I can't believe something that well written and directed came out of the Hollywood of late. I'm sure that the studio execs won't truly understand why it was a huge success. It's not the budget or the performances (though they were very good). It was the execution. The screenplay and direction made Batman a real human experience full of anguish and sacrifice.A side note to the Academy, it's time to nominate a superhero movie.",1
"The first rule of fight club. You must see fight club. This movie is great. As my friend said, it will change your life. The idea it conveys is brilliant, yet unreasonable. Brat Pitt makes such a good alter ego. His acting style is nice. For a crazy type hes perfect. I think the idea of underground fight clubs though is not a bad idea. I think there's too much rage in society as it is. Men need more of a way to bring them down to there primal intincts. After all were all animals. Kinda like sex. So many problems stem from those basic instincts. Perhaps thats why this film hold s some validity. Though once they start terrorizing stuff, thats going too far. Still and awesome movie.",1
"Her Nolan always thinks uniquely in the making of superheroes, psychological, thriller and science fiction movies. His uniqueness of screenplay and storytelling has its best on Inception. Maybe first time watchers have to see it again to understand but as a movie follower I really enjoyed every piece of the movie making.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest motion picture of all time. Tim Robbins does an outstanding job as portraying convicted Andy Dufresne, but supporting actor Morgan Freeman is the jewel of the movie and brings humanity to the whole crew of prisoners. Bob Gunton also provides a remarkable performance as the Warden. An incredibly dramatic story line followed by a satisfying ending plot twist. This piece of art truly deserves to be atop the IMDb Top 250 and should be watched by everybody, as the quality of this work can appeal to anyone. Over two hours of incredible role play and drama that are sure to make you want to see this masterpiece at least twice.",1
"But it's got its heart in the right place. First it's too long by at least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film.",1
"Wow, so much more then you typical superhero movie, in fact easily the best superhero movie ever made. I have to wonder why it has taken this long for someone like Christopher Nolan to come along and take these characters seriously and treat them as if they are real people. I can do nothing but thank Nolan for raising the bar in this genre, I would hope more will now follow his example. The only problem with that is I can't imagine anyone doing anything close to as good or better then The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan in my opinion has the only one who even has a chance to top this work. There are no words describe how spot on perfect Heath Ledger's Joker is, he completely embodies the character and takes him to a level neither him or the character have reached before. I was surprised to find the Ledger's performance didn't completely out shine the rest of the cast. Sure every Joker scene is amazing and your always left wanting more but the rest of the cast is awesome. Aaron Eckhart, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman are perfect, they play off each other amazingly and are the heart and soul of this film. Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman get more to do this time around and deliver some of the films most important lines. Maggie Gyllenhaal should have been cast as Rachel Dawes in the first place, Katie Holmes was a sore thumb that stood out in the all-star cast of Batman Begins. The special effects were amazing but more so because of the way they are blended into the film and feel less like ""special effect scenes"" and more like necessities to the story. The music by the master Hans Zimmer is even better then the Batman Begins and that's saying something, there is simply said and epic feel or should I say sound to it. At a 2 hour and 45 min runtime it still was not long enough for me and just when I thought I had seen the best this film had to offer the last scenes and the overlaid speech, brought an amazing ending to this amazing film.",1
"Not a bad movie, genuinely enjoyable.Batman was well acted by Bale. Ledger was fine as the Joker, but the raving some are giving about his performance borders on masturbation. It looks like he enjoyed the part. Maggie Gyllenhaal was slightly disappointing. She didn't show any particular chemistry with either of her love interests.I'm surprised that the Nolan brothers didn't subscribe a better musical score for this movie. The Dark Knight wasn't nearly as gripping as their previous movie, The Prestige (also starring Bale).TDK isn't without its plot holes. What was the fate of the businessman Lau? What did The Joker do to the hostages after Batman jumped from the window to save Dawes? The cell-phone sonar seemed daft. It was unnecessary and could easily have been cut from the movie without damaging the script in any way. It only seemed to provide Freeman with an opportunity to behave in a corny, self-righteous manner. Weak.The fight scenes were *much* better in Batman Begins. All the mêlée in TDK seemed dark and confusing. Perhaps that was the point, but the fighting in BB was really fun to watch. I could make similar comments about the Batmobile scenes which were also much better in the first movie.Still a good movie though, got me genuinely excited at some points, but not worthy of a 10/10 rating by any stretch of the imagination.",1
"I saw the movie this past weekend and am questioning whether I saw the same movie as some of the previous reviewers who have showered the film with the word ""masterpiece"" and the like.First, the positives: It is very clever and complex. Nolan's creativity and intelligence is apparent in both the storyline and script. It is incredibly well-filmed - the visuals were stunning. One of the fight scenes in zero-gravity was amazing. Marion Cotillard was well cast - she gave a great performance. Gordon-Levitt's and Tom Hardy's characters and performances were also likable. The ambiguous ending was very _ propos for the movie and made me smile.On the list of negatives: The length - this movie was way too long. There were many needless scenes - especially of people fighting without being able to tell who was fighting whom. It was as if the director was given a lot of money and couldn't figure out how to spend it all so he just added more more more. That ""more"" didn't add anything to the storyline - it just became a loud, blurry mess of concurrent fights and chases. The cuts back to the van falling interminably off the bridge got to the point of torture - and not the good ""edge-of-your-seat"" type. We get it...the various levels of the dreams happen at different speeds - continuing to show the van falling became annoying, not informative. The movie could have easily lost 30 mins of running time without affecting the narrative in any way.Ellen Page - it is very hard to take her seriously. She is one-note actress with no gravitas or credibility and was poorly miscast in a role that required someone with depth.The explanations of what was happening (subconscious projections, why characters stare, etc) sometimes left me thinking ""huh?"" Nolan got a little too clever at times which distracted from being able to enjoy the movie. I was left wondering what the heck they were saying.DiCaprio was his usual self - not good, not bad. Bland, unmemorable. He doesn't do anything really wrong - he's just vanilla in everything he does. You never forget that it's Leonardo DiCaprio when you're watching his movies. It is interesting that this movie and DiCaprio's last one - Shutter Island - had very similar themes for his character - issues with a dead wife haunting his thoughts - not knowing what was real or not - wanting to see his kids again but not being able to. I felt as though I had seen all this from ""Inception"" before in another movie. It wasn't any more interesting the second time around.I would recommend this movie for the originality and the way it was filmed. I would recommend that you take a blanket and pillow - you're in for the long haul.",1
"Althought the images are very good and the editing is one of the best I have ever seen, the movie made me want to leave the theater after an hour... Full of pseudo-morals and anti-consumerism messages, who has the patience for that?... Much ado about nothing...",1
"Fight Club was nothing like I was expecting.  I think based on the name I was expecting something more like Blood Sport.  It does not concentrate on fighting and who is the best but more on the freedom, release and desire of a man to fight. It is about a strange friendship that helps liberate a man from the regular bonds of life.  The formation of the fight club leads to bigger and grander schemes - all aimed at trying to free men in general from their normal passive responsibilities.  The club has a powerful far reaching affect. I think it is a very clever movie and introduces things I have never seen in any other movie.  It was refreshingly different.",1
"Is the Best movie! It's that people have not seen a film close. I think flawless. In the end, I agree with the film. It literally brought closer to life. Although the prison guards do not quite agree with, but I accepted. Overall, this film is good because it is about life, do not want to talk about. And it is difficult to bring film.",1
"In 1994 I saw Pulp Fiction in the theater 5 times. I was obsessed with it. Still am...it's my #2, and on occasion, #1. But there was another film I saw multiple times in the theater in '94 - The Shawshank Redemption.And this one, hardly anyone saw in the theater. Nobody really knew about it, until all of a sudden it was nominated for Best Picture and lots more Oscars. But honestly no one in the world thought it would win, I'm sure the Vegas odds were laughable. And of course Forrest Gump overshadowed both Shawshank & Pulp Fiction. So Shawshank was my film for years, I found it - randomly at my local theater. I owned it on VHS, I watched it incessantly. It's been my favorite film for 20 years. It's well known it gained a cult following on VHS. But IMDb really put it on the map. And IMDb is to be thanked for the last 7 or 8 years, of idiots who've just come into the film recently claiming it's ""a trendy film to claim as your favorite."" I want to get physically violent with people who say that. Rather, it's trendy for idiots to say it's trendy to love Shawshank.It doesn't matter. Shawshank is timeless. It is so layered, so thick & dense with ideas & emotions, subtleties & nuance & little moments that are gigantic. Watching Shawshank is a spiritual experience, a journey that never gets old. It's a drug.God, I just saw IMDb is getting close to racking up 1,200,000 votes on Shawshank. And 9.3. You cannot argue with that. It cuts across cultures, sexes, and races. Unbelievable miracle of a film, created by sunlight itself.",1
"There a very few film directors in this world that are allowed to pitch a complex and completely original concept to a studio and walk away with a budget to the tune of $200 million and make it, that said your name is Christopher Nolan and your last movie was The Dark Knight that did break all box office receipts, so exception granted.With Inception Nolan invites you into the world of the dream to explore alternate realities where the rules don't exist and this all sounds intriguing for a film that is essentially at it's core is a perfect classic heist story.The story sees Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is an extractor paid by sinister corporations who makes a questionable living by stealing the innermost ideas of powerful tycoons. He does so by infiltrating their dreams with the help of a team of operatives and a mysterious dream-sharing device. But then, as if fate had decided after a failed attempt at extracting information from one business executive Saito (Ken Watanabe, The Last Samurai), he is offered a job by the very same man. This time, however, must plant a new idea 'Inception' in the competitor's mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy, Batman Begins), rather than extract it.Nolan has ensemble a stellar cast to play out this story but it DiCaprio who gives an astonishing almost flawless like performance and his best since Blood Diamond to steal the show and surely it is finally time for that first Oscar to be awarded. He is backed up by his right hand man, the Organiser Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, (500) Days of Summer), Forger (Tom Hardy,RocknRolla) who gives a humorous performance. Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies) gives the film its emotional weight playing Cobb's wife Mal, Ellen Page (Ariadne) finally manages to step out from under the Juno stereotype, playing the Architect who is suspicious of Cobb's motives. Then there are the Nolan regulars Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe and Michael Caine, all of whom are vastly underused but nevertheless are still a pleasure to watch.The visual effects in 'Inception' are nothing short of breathless and are of the original kind that haven't been since like the Matrix, where you have exploding buildings, folding cities to zero-gravity suspended bodies. If that's not enough, there is also one sequence reminiscent of a James Bond movie with the team members decked out in matching winter gear and skis, fighting their way across a snowy landscape, whilst all the time these effects are beating to a pulsating Hans Zimmer score.Nolan really as outshone himself here since creating that near perfect movie of The Dark Knight two years ago, Inception is a bold, inventive and complex piece of film at heart and one that will take multiple viewings to fully appreciate beauty and genius from different perspectives that was much needed like The Usual Suspects and to flush out any flaws, if any. We know Christopher Nolan has signed on for Batman 3, but can he really top this?5*****",1
"I myself have always been a fan of Batman-I saw the first film in theaters with my parents when I was three (which may have been too young and DEFINITELY is for The Dark Knight), and I was hooked ever since. With this mindset I automatically assumed my biased opinion of the character would take control of my real thoughts on The Dark Knight film. Well. It definitely didn't hurt, but I think I would have loved this movie even if I had never heard of Batman going in. So far I've seen it five times and am going for a sixth tomorrow--in fact I can already say it is my favorite film--I don't even want to think about the movie that actually holds a candle to The Dark Knight, because I don't think anything as flawless as this film is going to come along for a long time.A few movies I would compare it to would be the first two Godfathers, Heat (Chris Nolan even has a reference to Heat i.e. William Fictner makes an appearance), and possibly--as far as the crime is concerned as well as the ceaseless care taken with the script. Chris and his brother Jonathon pay the utmost attention to detail--so much so that I have yet to see the movie and not notice something new each time. Everything from the soundtrack to the cinematography--the costumes and wardrobes to the set designs were as close to flawless as I have seen. That being said, I know roughly ten or fifteen people who are NOT Batman fans--and a few of which who do not even generally like this type of film say they LOVED it...and justifiably so as it is SO much more than just a Batman movie, or just a comic movie, for that matter.As for the acting...well it's all been said before, but even so I have no choice but to say it as well: the acting was superb. Heath Ledger has already received about as much--if not more praise for his portrayal of The Joker, as Javier Bardiem did for No Country For Old Men. In my mind, there is no performance that will even come close in terms of focus, commitment, and overall presence. I pity the actors who go up against Mr. Ledger WHEN he receives an Oscar nomination.Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman...all of these performers brought so much depth to the film and made it into one of the best ensemble casts I've seen since Pulp Fiction. Each of said mentioned names fell right back into character and delivered remarkable performances, save for Maggie Gyllenhaal who is a newcomer to Nolan's Batman series. She did something that surprised me: she took her role of Rachel Dawes in a completely different direction than Katie Holmes. While most people bash Katie for her portray of Rachel Dawes, I didn't have a problem with it. Sure, I would say it was the weakest link in Begins, but it still did not bother me. Maggie Gyllenhaal on the other hand pulled off a very difficult feat. She managed to remain the tough, independent, assistant D.A. that the role called for with absolutely no compromise while simultaneously pulling off something her predecessor did not: she had very good chemistry with Christian Bale. In addition to that, she also had great chemistry with Aaron Eckhart.To conclude, the movie is a 'masterpiece,' but even that word doesn't seem to do enough justice to what Christopher Nolan accomplished which is the most ambitious film I've seen in a very long time. My only regret is that we can never see Heath Ledger reprise what was hands down his finest performance. It remains ironic to me that his finest performance was synonymous with his darkest hour. His death was untimely, unfair, and in my firm belief nothing more than a stupid mistake with the worst kind of consequence. My condolences go out to his beautiful little girl. Hopefully, when she's older, she'll watch this movie and appreciate what her father had to go through in order to become what he did on screen. With a little luck, she may learn what he gave to become The Joker--a role that will NEVER be topped and never be forgotten...and a role that I am forever grateful Heath Ledeger chose to accept. I also hope one day Matilda Ledger will see the staggering amount of people who watched her father play a character (and loved his performance as much as I did) that could easily have turned into an imitation of Mr. Nicholson's own performance--and understand that he put everything he had into it. I hope she will understand what that kind of passion took to energetically, and consistently portray his character, and what the cost was.Heath Ledger, took the Joker and instead, of imitating and merely updating the role, he took it in a completely new direction (aided with Chris Nolan's screenplay) and created the most masterful performance I have ever seen--one that I doubt will ever be topped (at least in my eyes), by anyone. Thank you for sharing your passion with the rest of world, Heath. You will be missed, but never forgotten.--Jason",1
"All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really ""Red"". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact.",1
"This is a movie that represents Generation X. David Fincher's masterful direction takes Brad Pitt and Edward Norton into iconic territory. A game changer in color bringing in a greenish tint to the film, Fincher goes into the mind of his characters and shoots right through to their souls.
Known for his excessive takes, Fincher continues to film until he gets it just right. And Edward Norton is fabulous as he takes us on the journey as the Narrator in this story which was originally written by best-selling novelist Chuck Palahniuk.
A visionary film about the estranged Narrator who falls under the spell of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic bad ass with a master plan that may be more than just creating a Fight Club.",1

"A Masterpiece of it's own. The hype is not overreacted, this movie is one of the best I've ever seen.The dialogs are nice, a good change of environment and ace acting. The theory of reality and dreams, giving you space to build an own opinion.Leonardo di Caprio's best movie yet. After seeing him in almost every movie he was in I can say that with certainty. A shame he didn't get an Oscar for this!If you like movies which go deep in thought and plot you're right here. It get's tense and thrilling, yet gives you time to think about it. A plot twist makes you even more mouth-opened.Every Minute is worth it and you won't be disappointed. But.. is it a dream? Or ist it reality? ;-)",1
"Not a big fan of Lost, but this is still a good movie. After my long critique below. Just remember this: Its a very entertaining movie, nonetheless. I think there's a lot of similaritie with Lost, the two use a similar formula. Note: Inception has a lot more action, though the action in Inception seems planted and fake at times. (more on it later) Here's how the formula works. Writers come up with a loose plot, with multiple possibilities, and throw ideas on top of it. Here, it worked. They constructed a pretty nice story, which is more like a piece of abstract art than a well knit tale. This is no ""Memento"", ""Usual Suspects"" or ""Vanilla Sky"". In those movies, you eventually understand how everything happened. This is intentionally different.It has an open plot. Keeps you thinking. The story? Above average. Think about it. The plot surrounding the action sequences is pretty cookie cutter. A special team breaks in... type movie. The complexity revolves around the sub-plot, Leonardo's character, how do the two tie together?The characters? C'mon. Not that good. There's 1000 movies with more emotion and more developed characters. This was built to be an explosion-filled summer blockbuster. Do you always dream about guns and explosions? I don't. Apparantley every character in this movie does. I just thought they could have taken the dreams in so many interesting ways, but relied on the James Bond formula too much, for Summer ticket sales. This movie has a unique hook. They want you discussing it. They want you to try and figure it out. There is no 100% 'accurate' solution to how the two plots (mentioned above) fit together. It will leave some frustrated with an empty feeling.Some of the characters were developed way too fast. I thought they needed to spend way more time on Ellen Page and Decaprio's relationship. Ellen Page goes from innocent student to commanding expert in no time.The movie thoroughly confuses you, then comes together. Or does it? It leaves you thinking there's more to it. And thats what they want.I think the action sequences are a little off. They give no reason for why everyone shoots guns in dreams and behave like trained special forces. Thats just 'understood'. There's quite a bit of this movie that supposed to be 'understood'. And you'll be trying to understand it for quite a while.",1
This Modern day classic is a suspense thriller I've seen this movie a dozen times and can watch over and over again. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are a great duo on screen. Set in in the 60s (Robbins) Andy is convicted of a crime and sent to prison where he is completely out of place. At first he is not received well or welcomed by the other prisoners for his clean looks and appearance. He settles into his surroundings and finds his place while befriending a fellow inmate. Meanwhile he is secretly plotting his escape from prison plan. This movie is one of my personal top ten favorites of all time! I do not want to spoil the ending in case you have not seen this great movie yet. A must see!,1
"David Fincher and co do an amazing job of bringing a complicated and existential novel to life on the big screen. Pitt and Norton do a fantastic job of capturing the themes and the essence of the novel and really pushing the audience to consider their life choices. Throw in a great supporting cast including Helena Bonham Carter as the suicidal waif and Meatloaf as the over the hill bodybuilder to round things out. The twist is handled so well that repeat viewings are essential. Definitely worth having in your collection, and if you enjoy the film then I recommend the book.",1
"Sadly I had to travel to an old and tiny cinema to see this movie as it didn't play in the major cinemas on the Gold Coast...after watching this movie i have absolutely no clue why.I truly enjoyed every minute of this film, all of the actors did a great job, especially Morgan Freeman. I did see some of the plot lines coming and still got a bit of a surprise in how they delivered those plot lines...if you get a chance and like a classic with brains then go and watch this!!!",1
"An impressive thriller with a cohesive history. Sci-fi elements inserted into the drama in the best possible way. Where a person is tied to history.If it counts on the emotional side, a father who tries to recover the children, after the mother has killed herself. A cast full of stars that can act. Leonardo at the best moment of his career. Impressive.The best special effects I've ever seen in a long time. Innovative, complete, perfect. They connect the drama and the spectacle in a perfect way. The parallel sequences that raise the tension to the limit that only Christopher Nolan manages to do with this quality.That being said as Christopher Nolan put the drama in the film in such a perfect way that it made it original. Nobody can say that Nolan copied something from someone. A job that only Christopher Nolan knows how to do.All this talk about the sound aspect and soundtrack, chosen by Nolan that help us to be inserted in this perfect universe, in a cohesive form that we do not want to leave.And the end is the icing on the cake. Even after watching the movie, you're left wondering. As Total Recall, the movie does not end in the end, but leaves you want to return to that wonderful universe. An excellent ending to an almost perfect movie.An almost perfect movie. I've seen 3 times in theaters in 2010. I bought the DVD and Blu Ray. And I'm waiting for the sale of Blu ray 4K, to give more money to Warner Bros, because this movie is worth. A blessing.",1
This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls!!!

"A masterpiece of genius, a movie you can watch over and over again, is not a complete play. I remember that when I saw this movie a few years ago, the impression I left was gradually destroyed. When we look again, we will know what a classic is. It's a spoof of justice, store bullying, weakness, collective unconsciousness, multifaceted humanity, and a lot of psychological knowledge. Genius and madness, genius and schizophrenia, there are no such thoughts in everyone's mind. Don't imitate the behavior in the film.",1
"After several outstanding actions movies this year, we get the idea that filmmakers have finally started doing justice to the original sources, the stories of heroes that are flawed, strive to conquer evil and maybe eventually better themselves and the world. We had the joy of traveling the road with ""Ironman"", with its flawed protagonist who tries very hard to use technology to defeat his nemesis. Then Indiana Jones makes a return appearance, showing how age is taking its toll on his armor, giving us a couple of surprises and quite an ending for its installment. The much improved ""Hulk"" benefits from a leaner screenplay and a great performance by Norton, but nothing prepared for us the magnificent achievement that the sequel to ""Batman Begins"" turned out to be.""The Dark Knight"" is almost a perfect film. Its sole blemish is a bit of miscasting, taking away a bit of the believability of the main character. Leaving that aside, we welcome back Michael Caine's Alfred, with his blend of sarcasm and fondness for his protégé. Then Morgan Freeman's imposing technological wizardry, still works very well, as he must now decide whether he should follow Bruce Wayne in his new path. Oldman's commissioner takes on more responsibilities and makes more dangerous choices, some of which will shock the audience.It's the new arrivals that add the punch to this film, first Eckart's Two Face is a wonder to behold in his transformation from the ultimate knight in shining armor to the tormented villain who descends into madness as the film reaches its conclusion. However, it is the wonderful and bewitching Ledger who has the winning hand and turns what could be a regular drama into a powerful epic where evil has no reason and knows no fear. His Joker is a perverse, demented, and killing machine, a creature that knows no boundaries, doesn't know the meaning of remorse or probably listens to his conscience anymore, if he ever had one.His series of crimes begins with an assault on a local bank, and the execution of the heist is explosive and unforgiving, and if the audience is still catching his breath from the explosive happening, this sets the stage for worse things to come. Soon this metropolis will have turned into hell and the Joker is king, with Batman soon struggling to find ways to control the chaos and realizing this might be the challenge of his life.Ledger's performance has many shades, incorporating a range of emotions hardly seen in any movies before. His madness is a very cool act, a performance for those who want to pay attention to the repulsive actions of a criminal who wants to test the mettle of a society that is slowly thinking into something more horrible than they want to believe. He knows this and grabs them by the throat, soon having them confront their fears and their natures. Words like unbelievable will come to mind as we seen him do his joyful, demented celebratory dance, telling others that the world is about to end. If the film is not perfect, Ledger is, a force to behold, and an intensity to match, and this where Bale comes.Bale doesn't disappoint, and he delivers his most solid performance, as his caped crusader must use his wit, physical stamina, and his sense of morale to vanquish his biggest challenges. Bale is now tormented by guilt and pain, like he has never seen before, and he might soon discover that he is someone he didn't know.""The Dark Knight"" is indeed a masterpiece, a film that weaves many elements, rarely seen in escapist entertainment, such as the superhero genre. We have a story dealing with human duality, with political and social ethics, with the fine line that separates sanity and madness, and what each might be. There are many floating metaphors in this film, such as the coin, the choice, the colors, the meaning of what truth really is. It is a fantastic achievement, and it should be honored and recognized by everyone who sees it.",1
"I just watched inception for the first time without any previous knowledge of what the movie was about, who was in it, or even when it was made. I don't know how I missed hearing about this movie. I am so amazed and stunned by what I just watched that its almost hard to concentrate. When the credits started rolling I couldn't breath. Utterly dumbfounded. Maybe the best movie I have ever seen. My favorite movies to date are Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Waking Life. This movie fits perfectly into this list. If this movie doesn't blow your mind then you might not have one. All I can say about this is it is truly best if you can watch this movie without watching the trailer first. Pure beauty.",1
"The thought process behind this movie is insane. I have nothing else to say. Watch it, if you haven't already.",1
One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie.,1
"This film went beyond my expectations! The Nolans have taken the Batman story to a new level. Some won't like it because the film is EXTREMELY dark and gritty, and I highly recommend that children not see this movie, but it is a true masterpiece.All of the acting is great, but Heath Ledger was amazing! The hype is true for once, and the man's performance as the Joker is one of the most impressive that you will ever see. I have never been a Heath Ledger fan, the guy had never been in any films of my interest, so I'm not saying this just because his recent and tragic passing. He steals the show.The Joker is so sadistic, he manages to be both terrifying and, at times, humorous. The rest of the cast does an amazing performance, and the writing and directing are second to none. Go and see this movie!",1
"Great Acting, Surprising and well told story, Humor, Fights and buildings being blown up. What more can you ask for in a movie???? If you haven't see this movie NOW!!!!!!!",1
"fantasticfight club every day. this movie is so brilliant from start to end. pure gold, i can watch this many time and never get bored. actors, music, effects, everything is fantastic. outstanding performances by main actors create unique atmosphere for movie ranking among the finest achievements in the history of cinema.",1
Heath Ledger is phenomenal. I don't think there will be another Joker like him,1
"I absolutely love this movie and it is definitely one i can watch over and over again, it took me a while to figure out the movie, maybe after watching it a couple times but now i understand i can't get enough of it. Be willing to watch it more than once because if you're like me it will take more than once to understand. Both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton both play their parts very well in my opinion and make a great duo. The director did a great job which isn't surprising because of his list of great movies he has directed like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Gone Girl. Absolutely fantastic and would recommend to everyone, probably one of my favourite movies from the ninety's.",1
"I'm truly speechless...! This movie is so great that I don't know how to describe it! This is one of Fincher's best movies! The story of this film truly fascinated me. You start of as the ""Narrator""(Edward Norton), who is up in a tall building with Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt). ""The Narrator"" (Edward) is sitting tied up in a chair all beaten up. I thought: ""What on earth is he doing there?"", and that's when I realized how good movie this was going to be! Afterwords you get some flashbacks where you see how he got in that chair in the first place! And that's when the good stuff begins..! I recommend this film to everyone who just wants to sit back and enjoy a good movie!",1
"Personally, I rate this move a 7.5, but I'll round it up, since that is not an option. What is Fight Club? Maybe a dark comedy. I think that's fitting. But, it's also a drama when we see how (in some parts) it truthfully presents a type of modern living. This movie brings up the issue of substance: are the things that make up many of our lives--our work, our possessions, even our relationships--substantial. It comments on these areas through the main character, who is emotionally numb, yet keenly critical. This movie is stylish, in the way that it's shot; however, it does not distract from the film. It's thought-provoking and perplexing. The subjects Fight Club brings up can be appreciated by all.",1
"This film is the definition of technical brilliance, as everything on a filmmaking, production and visual level is superb. It's very easy to be absorbed into the world that Nolan creates, thus making the story that much more engaging.On an acting side the ensemble put in decent performances all around, particularly from Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, who imbue their characters with a lot of personality.And to top it all off, there is a very complex but well-written story at the centre of it all, which helps the two and a half hour runtime zip by. The last half and hour is especially captivating as many different story elements come together in a satisfying conclusion.For me this confirms Nolan as one of the greatest directors working in the 21st century. He has managed to perfect his craft on a technical level, whilst still missing the emotional resonance of the story which prevents me from giving this a 10/10.",1
"This movie title is nothing like the movie. Keep in mind that the movie was based on a book by Stephen King. For a fan of King this is not something that you would expect. The movie has very little action in it, but is about true redemption, which is not revealed until the end of the movie. Personally I love this movie. The way that the cast interacts with each other is really what gives this movie the flare that you need. The prison that it was filmed at is a real prison located in Mansfield, Ohio. It can actually be toured by the general public, as can other aspects of the movie. This is a definite must see movie for anyone who wants something that will make them think about what is important in life.",1
"One of the best movies I have ever watched. The acting was so good, professional, and talented.Heath Ledger did one of a kind performance and shown he was something to be bought up through the rest of movie history. It's sad that the legend is gone, but for sure, he will be remembered. He will be remembered as one of the greatest actors of all time.",1
"One of the best themes for motivational movies ever chosen and one of the few movies that you see and understand differently every time you watch it again. It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favourable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge.",1
"This will forever be a classic. 
""get busy livin or get busy dyin""",1
"In my opinion, Fight Club is the greatest achievement in modern literature, I don't even have to explain why, but one reason is that it highlights so-many tragic viewpoints that are so applicable to today's decrepit society.",1
One of the Best movies of Lifetime! The Emotion in this movie of human spirit and is one of the best.,1
"I knew, after the first few scenes of Inception, that I was going to have to buy into this world. Unlike other better films (The Prestige, Total Recall, and Memento) I wasn't sold that this concept is plausible. Perhaps it's because of my feeble movie-going mind. Or perhaps it's due to the fact that the Idea ""of dream entering"" is not sold to us but rather thrust upon us to set up the series of Slow Mo scenes in dreamlike states.I want to say the film was fun, and Nolan is a credible director; but to all those trying to contemplate what the film meant: I hate to be the one to tell you that Nolan is no Lynch. There isn't some weird enigma wrapped in a riddle. It's basically a fun premise executed with a lot of slow mo C.G.I. and great actors. Enjoy the film and the popcorn and try not to get too wrapped up into figuring it out. It does a fine job of spoon feeding the story to you.THE CAKE IS A LIE!",1
"Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner.",1
"The prison film is an outstanding masterpiece. But whether it really belongs to the best films in film history is debatable. However, the fact is that like no other, the movie inspires many people across generations. The representation of a lifelong friendship between the two prison inmates, played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, is outstanding. Above all, however, the interplay of right and wrong, which is not always easy to separate behind the walls of a prison, is worked out here too deeply emotionally. It was rewarded with seven Oscar nominations, and rightly so.",1
"This film blends the line between goofy comic book fun and gritty real-life situations. This paired with the best villainous performance in history, circa Heath Ledger (May he rest in peace,) and you get a truly fine work of art and a modern day masterpiece.",1
"Where does one even start with this movie? It has to be one of the smartest films ever made, and could be taken as course on modern living, and its unlimited disappointments.The number of sentences that stick in my mind having watched this film is incredible. It is choc-full of memorable quotes, and designs for life.Brad Pitt is iconic as Tyler Durden - quite possibly the coolest character in the history of film. Edward Norton went from being a big-built neo-Nazi (American History X) to being a footstool of corporate America in no time at all. Fair play to Helena Bonham-Carter, whose character changes in the minds of the viewer towards the end of the film, but who adds depth and humour to the film.The overall feel of this film, is one of rebellion. This is one of the most important movies ever made, and deserves a place in the history of cinema as a genuine groundbreaker.",1
Play Fight Club! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!,1
"When I finished watching inception I had to take a deep breath and convince my mind that I wasn't dreaming myself.This is honestly one of the best films I have seen. I lucid dream myself so seeing this film was quite special for me. I identified with the concepts of reality, what is real? how do you know if you are in the real world or not?IF you haven't seen this yet I advise you to do so.. I mean this is on a matrix-type scale, it really is. Brilliant start to finish. I wish I could articulate more but I just can't you must see for yourself..I think 8.8 is actually among the highest ratings a film can get. It is truly a quality film. Though I think it deserves an average of 9.5 at least!",1

Movie is a bit slow at start but takes turn at the end. This movie has some greatest lessons for life,1
"This movie is very Amazing!
The only other movie I have even seen That effects me as strongly is to kill a Mockingbird.",1
"The Shawshank redemption is probably still the best movie ever made. The pacing of the movie, the script and the terrific acting of actors like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are just perfect. Frank Derabont did a fantastic job with the screenplay and the directing of the film. (A short story of no less then Stephen King).The movie takes you into the human side of living in a prison. Rather than gang banging thugs, which makes it a very fresh experience. The emotions that Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins bring to the screen feel real as they bond through the years. It's amazing and a must watch.If you don't have this movie in your collection, shame on you. There is absolutely no valid reason not to like this movie. And this movie being on the top of IMDb top250 charts is just proof of that. At this point your still reading this review..., and all I'm thinking is that you are wasting your time by NOT watching this movie. Go, Hurry, what are you waiting for?",1
Simply stunning picture and a cant miss for any movie buff. Such a good story.,1
"The Shawshank Redemption by Frank Darabont is a classic film that tells the story of a man who overcomes the worst hardship and uses his wit to deceive his authorities. The audience follows a man named Andy Dufrense through both the most terrible, and the most heartwarming events imaginable. As the film progresses, viewers develop a connection with the main characters as suspense builds with each succeeding event (Ebert). Camera angles are important in every movie from romance films to action films to comedies; however in a film that is as emotionally connected as the Shawshank Redemption, camera angles are one of the primary reasons this movie is so renowned. This original story by Stephen King obviously laid a great foundation for Darabont's film; however the film uses different angles to enhance scene suspense_ something that a book cannot do. Frank Darabont's use of specific camera angles throughout the film draws the audience closer to the characters, creating an intimate relationship that makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the best movies of all time. Darabont's choice of camera angle develops a connection between Andy and the audience watching him, making for a much stronger overall film. The first demonstration of brilliant camera angle is the court scene, which shows up early in the film. The camera slowly zooms into his face, revealing his expression of complete shock and awe. This is critical because it gets the audience to realize the pain he is in at the moment. The next moment of noticeable camera work is when Andy is locked into his cell. The camera follows him through the hallway, and then enters the cell with him. The tiny detail to have the camera join Andy in the dark cell connects the audience in a way that literature cannot. At this point, the audience feels the harsh entrapment that Andy feels. The next catastrophic scene in the movie is Andy's rape. The camera does something here that works perfectly at making viewers feel horrible for the protagonist. It shows Andy alone in the laundry room, yet uses the single light source to show only the dark side of his body. As opposed to telling us that he is terribly depressed, the camera angle uses darkness to reveal how he feels. Towards the end of the movie, the camera uses one last movement that truly stands out. Darabont chose to both zoom out and tilt the camera down to give the sensation of rising into the sky. Viewers feel the same sense of freedom that Andy feels that that moment. The view-points of these events give the movie an upper hand to written version. Although the camera doesn't put these events in Andy's point of view, it still manages to make observers feel exactly what he is. Each of these choices in camera movement makes its own unique statement, yet they all bond spectators to Andy by stimulating our intrigue, sorrow, or joy. Camera angle is frequently used to build suspense throughout the movie which draws the audience in and holds them there. The first immensely suspenseful scene is when 'the sisters' rape Andy after beating him up. The camera uses a dolly shot to fade away from the men, while simultaneously moving behind a corner so the audience cannot see all of the horrible events happening to Andy. The rest of the event is left up to imagination, which makes the spectators think about how Andy feels. The camera movement itself is suspenseful in its nature. The next suspense-building scene is the book-shelving scene in the library that Andy took over. The camera shows Andy and Red's conversation from shelf to shelf, making them pause between each of their statements. At this point, they were talking about Andy's cunning in taking over the warden's financial situation. Each time they move, the camera pans with them, forcing them to pause their conversation, which obviously leads the audience to anticipation_wondering what will be said next. Another great example is Red's journey out of the Shawshank Prison. The point of view switches over to Red, however the camera's talent of building suspense remains the same. Brooks left the prison before Red, and took a journey through town to a halfway house, where he hangs himself, leaving a note: 'Brooks was here.' Once Red is released, he follows Brooks' exact journey from location to location, and then etches into the walls next to Brooks' note 'so was Red.' The camera focuses on the writing on the wall so the audience cannot see whether or not Red hung himself just like Brooks. After this, the director utilizes pedestal movement to slowly reveal the rest of the room, and it is discovered that Red did not hang himself, relieving the audience instantly. In this instance, the camera helped the movie build suspense where the book version would not be able to. After this scene, as the movie is finishing up, the audience is taken to the orchards with Red, in search of the note Andy left for him. This is one last moment of suspense because of the camera angle. It tracks Red along the stone wall, but never shows us what he sees, leaving the viewer's asking 'will he find the special package or not?' Resolving the situation is in Red's hands, and the camera helps to build suspense until he finally sees the unique rock. Often, words with a story can create enough suspense to draw a group of people in; yet adding unique viewpoints will maximize the anticipation in most any movie.Though The Shawshank Redemption never earned any Oscars, it received seven nominations for multiple awards including best picture.This movie has not received all of the popular accolades it deserves, yet that doesn't take away from its brilliance.",1
"If there is anything that Inception has taught me, it's that anything is possible with films. There are very few films that I have seen that deliver this message. Star Wars delivered a galaxy full of imaginative creation. The Matrix showed us a world where rules could be broken and people could dodge bullets. Avatar took us to another world the likes of which we have never seen. Now, Inception takes us to places we can only dream of. I will start by saying two things that may contradict each other. The first is that this film has something for everyone. There's plenty of action, drama, noir, suspense, and mind games for those who like to be intrigued. At the same time, this will not be a film for everyone. The nit-picky will find all the little tiny things to question, most notably the logic involved in the whole subconscious sneakery and 'whose dream are we in?' logic. But quite honestly, any possible holes are completely forgiven. Not only is this the best written film of the year, but this is one of the most imaginative films in years.I really have to applaud Nolan for taking a chance. Few filmmakers would dare to go out on such a limb and not only try and create such a complex web of dream logic and rules, but also make sense of so many things going on at once. At one point in the film there are four different realities occurring at the same time. There are only a few filmmakers I can even think of that would dare try and create such feat. Even fewer I can think of that make it work. And Nolan does. At first, all the dream logic had my head buzzing, but it mattered little once we hit the dream world. While dizzying, the exposition fits. It's so fascinating and so far from anything that we have seen that the first hour, which is mainly made up of explanations of how things work, is rather welcome as opposed to frowned upon.Nolan's writing shines here. He does what The Matrix once did and bends rules, even breaking some to shape a wholly different reality where cities topple and even gravity gives way to a change in the rules of reality. It's completely fascinating and suspenseful. I even found myself exhaling out loud. And while it may seem like nothing much more than a whole bunch of pretty images and special effects, this is all supported by a strongly written main character and well acted supporting cast. Although the only really deep relationships here are between DiCaprio's character Cobb and his wife and Page's character, the cast as a whole is enjoyable. Joseph Gordon Levitt is the action heavy, doing a lot of the physical fighting, while Tom Hardy is the comic relief (when comedy presents itself). There are a few a members who could be called one note. Watanabe's character is a fairly one note evil corporate head type and Cillian Murphy plays the gullible victim. But even these characters have moments of humanity which shine through.While the film deals in reality defying moments, there are some very entertaining, more practical elements, like the shootouts and the heist planning. These play out like their subsequent genre staples, and I'm very thankful for that. The shootouts are practical and exciting. The heist elements will be familiar to anyone who is familiar with the heist sub-genre, but in this case it's all about people who deal in cerebral elements and must plan their actions around mental manipulation and subconscious trickery. I don't think I could say enough about my enjoyment of this film, but I will say that it is truly one of the best film events in recent memory that I have enjoyed. While this summer has been filled with disappointment at the theater, Inception was worth it. If this film doesn't grab your imagination by the balls, then I don't know what will.",1
"Christopher Nolan has done it again. Nolan has touched and dressed up the movie with action (gravity defying action), thrills, frills, suspense, guns, chase sequences etc etc etc. Yet underneath all the glorious detail in appearance, there is a brilliant story that is so unusual yet intriguing, imaginative yet possible, innovative and compelling. The story is so intriguing that you start questioning every element of it. However, Nolan does not give you enough time as he keeps you on the edge of your seats, pounding on you with the relentless pace of the movie.There is one important aspect though - the movie keeps you guessing. It does not give you a definite answer. It is open so that each man can fill in his own answer to the questions raised in the movie based on his own understanding . That does not mean there is no conclusion to it at all. Your mind itself is the conclusion. There is enough detail in the movie for you to fill in the appropriate answer. He lets you wonder, think, review and discuss about it.SO... By laying a strong foundation with the story that is original and adding a strong support cast with all the necessary elements for a blockbuster and then .. merging everything seamlessly into 2 hours and 30 minutes of brilliant screenplay(lengthy compared to current Hollywood trends) - Nolan has provided a movie that caters to all audiences. This isn't a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. This is simply perfection. Perfect 10!!!!",1
"When I first got this movie, I was so excited. After hearing all the great things and how it was a top 10 movie of all time. As soon as I started the movie, it was honestly just weird, hard to understand, and random. As the movie came to and end, I was netural with the feeling about this film. Some things were good, some were bad. Now Tyler Durden, that was the best thing about this movie. He was a guy that many people are envious of. Laid back, cool, exciting. Brad Pitt played the part perfectly. But just the whole story line was, in my opinion, not that exciting. Don't get me wrong, there were some awesome parts, but there were some bad parts as well. I'm not at all saying this movie was bad, but I felt let down or disappointed after hearing all the rant and rave about how great of a movie it was. So overall, I view the movie as exceptional acting and awesome characters, but not so good of a story line. Other than that it was fine.",1
"Seldom does the experience of going out to the movies reward the audience with more than worth the price of admission. Inception does this in spades...In fact, I have already gone back to see the movie for the second time. If possible, see the movie in IMAX because the sound quality alone is worth the extra cash. Inception succeeds because everything they used to make it was the utmost quality. The story is unique and innovative. Nolan reuses many actors from his previous films but it turns out to be a winning formula. The actors are all immensely talented and all give completely believable performances. The special effects are so good it is impossible to tell what is real and what is not...mimicking the movie's plot itself. The editing is Oscar worthy. Switching seamlessly back and forth between lightning quick battle scenes and slow motion fall symphonies. I can't think of any film that maintains high-speed intensity and ultra slow motion serenity even close to the level that Inception does. This film is truly a work of art.I have longed for a film to truly captivate me as I watched it. Coercing you to decode the movie detective style as you watch each scene, Inception completely brings back the joy of uncertainty. The story is so deep and layered you almost have to see it multiple times to grasp all the information that's thrown at you. DEFINITELY SEE THIS MOVIE! It inspires so much that you can't help but talk about it because it suggests a radical idea with multiple interpretations. I don't think that any movie can ever be perfect but this film comes damn close.",1
"The best movie for batman ever! the best cast! christian bale is the real deal, no one can be better batman than he is.",1
Best film ever made. Therefore 11 out of 10. Period.,1
"This was the best movie this year! I'm sure all of you know the plot if not then read the other comments. The best(or worst) part of the movie, is of course, sometimes hard to keep up with what the Joker and Batman are trying to say, along with trying to interpret Batman's outrageously deep voice (it was so hard to hear it sometimes). buttt you will enjoy the action, plot, and drama in this movie .. it's much better than the first one...and a lot longer, at an almost 2 hour 30 minutes...yet every scene counts to your understanding of the end of the film. As the Joker undermines Gotham City (by using psychological warfare/fear), you will both hate and love him. Some of the things he does in the film are extravagant and heinous; you will be disgusted, guaranteed. Don't mind Christian Bale's monotonous perspective; don't think too much about the corruption of Gotham City's cops. And admire Joker's tentative and ambivalent personas.make sure you relax and enjoy the ride. Batman has a tough challenge.!",1
"I don't recall ever watching any on-screen performance as great as Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. I'm not a great fan of the Batman franchise, and the runtime of this movie is a little too long in my opinion.With that said; everyone should watch this because of Heath. Oscar well deserved.",1
"When i watched this film i nearly collapsed. It's the greatest film EVER. It's violent, brutal, funny, silly, dark and disturbing, all in one little package. Though it's long and sometimes films can lose it in there length it carried on being all it's cracked up to be until the ending. Story= A man with a sleeping disorder goes to clubs about disability's, (cancer etc.) though he didn't have any of them, to help him have a good nights sleep. But when his condo is blown up he goes to live with a man he met on a plane, a man he'd only met once. Outside a bar he punches the man on his will and they start brawling. Afterwards they like fighting (and it helps his sleep) so they carry on to set up ""Fight Club"", unknowing of what it'd lead to. 10/10 Acting= The acting is brilliant. Enough said. 10/10 Humour= Funny bits include lines, actions, looks, everything. A lot of the film makes you laugh without being a comedy, brilliant. 10/10Overall a film that is perfect and truly the greatest film ever made.",1
"What a great movie, movie worth watching. 2 hours went away without knowing will watch it again.",1
I think this is one of the best movies ever. The plot was really a big surprise. Why don't they give Edward Norton a Oscar? I would recommend this movie to every movie freak.,1
"Well I would review this topic from my level of understanding and judgement.While judging it for the first time, I was not quite impressed. It was later, that I realised it was because of the bar that was set, set by director Christopher Nolan. A few movies like 'Edge Of Tomorrow' went through my mind to set the right idea of expectation and delivery.I am not happy with the visual appeal with most of recent movies and inception is no different. Damn it! It even got an Oscar for that. It's the director that needs to be praised most, the research carried out, the story laid are unparallel.",1
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"". Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars",1
"The movie was stunning. You have to give full credits to David Fincher. His way of presenting the previously said story is completely unmatchable. At times, the movie was way over the top of exaggeration but in the end everything falls in place. The movie was fast tracked at many places and many sequences were skipped that were present in the previous version. The sequences were copied very much to the exactness of the situation and it was a good effort to bring back the charisma that a personality like Tyler Durden should have. One more special thing about this movie is its climax, which was not at all stereotype. Hollywood movies is brilliantly done. I would say Fight Club was an overall entertainer and is definitely worth a watch.",1
"I can relate so much with the character Andy, it resembles me a lot. Tim and Freeman were awesome with their acting skill",1
"This was a pretty good film. The production quality was magnificent and Ledger's performance as the joker was magnificent.Overall, it opened strongly and for the most part, it was an engaging film with plenty of action and plot twists. However, there was something a bit ""overdone"" about the film. As another reviewer said, the ending felt as if it was built on as it was not born out of the main storyline.Second, there were too many sub-plots that distracted from the over-arching plot of the film. Similarly, there were abnormalities and things we feel are important seem to drop in and out of the storyline.Was Wayne still in love with Rachel? Was she still in love with him? Why did this fade in and out of importance? Was the joker trying to catch the batman for a share of the crime syndicate's money? Yes, no, but yes.... but ultimately no. Is Batman retiring? Yes!.... no! But why would he? Seemed the reason given was vague and confusing.What happened to the Lau? The crooked accountant snatched out of Hong Kong? The transformation of Dent's character was a bit odd and the dialogue at the end about Batman being the ""dark knight"" was a bit dumb! I did like it, but the screenplay and plotting was overdone and not enough focus was given to the primary plots. So in the end, it came off a bit scrambled. Excellent performances all round, I must say.",1

"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.",1
"This film is so amazing. This is about a man called Andy who is found the guilty of the murder of his wife and her lover and sentenced to a prison. He struggles to get through hardship. He is so smart that he becomes an outstanding person. First of all, this film is narrated by the second lead character, Red, which makes the audiences see Andy from Red's view unconsciously. His smartness leads to an incredible ending. Each scenes are dropped advance hints, and in the end, each pieces are put together. His smartness blew me away. This film makes us think about what the life is. The last scene is incredibly beautiful. This film is definitely one of masterpieces.",1
"Inception itself suggests the beginning of something and for what Christopher Nolan is renowned.This is an example of the litheness of dream, where you can find yourself somewhere on the globe without knowing the path. Christopher Nolan has proved it once again after ""The Following"" ""Memento"", ""The Prestige"" , ""The Dark Night"" that he is here for the makeover of the contemporary cinema.Inception is surreal and Nolan used incongruous juxtapositions in order to represent unconscious thoughts and dreams. The dominion of surrealism is unidentified and tenuous, when we endeavor to concoct it, the aftermath can go off beam.This movie displays the ahead of its time planet where we can intercept human minds through dream foray and we can make them alter their mental picture. Leonardo Dicaprio plays the role flawlessly and effortlessly as he is one of finest actors. He blatantly gets into the character and exhibits the real intricacies and restrictions of Cobb. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has an embellishing screen presence, Ken Watanabe is excellent and Ellen Page is not lost among the stars. Marion Cotillard is wonderful depicting her pain and mental suffering as, Mal.Nolan's is unsurpassed and exceptionally creative,Inception is an epitome of his brilliance.",1
"Good! Fotis Andrianakos If you are feeling like tasting something which is definitely going to tickle your taste buds, you've most definitely managed to stumble upon the right place. With this in mind, the Fotis Andrianakos Restaurant is a venue which is going to provide you with everything you might ask for out of a great meal. Things to ConsiderNow, while it's true that over the last few years the concept of eating in a restaurant has become quite popular, there are certain things that need to be taken into account. The truth is that the economy is rather shaky, to say the least, and dining at a restaurant is still considered a luxury which not everyone can afford regularly. This is what makes the choice of a great restaurant even more pressing. And, considering the sheer abundance of options on the market, the Fotis Andrianakos Restaurant can truly turn out to be one of the best places for you and your family as well as your close friends.

"Cobb (Leonard DiCaprio) has an interesting ""job"" in the near future. If someone wants to beat out the competition in business, they hire Cobb to infiltrate the competitor's dream cycle and steal his or her's inventive ideas. Whew! This is such a complicated strategy that Cobb has a sidekick (Joseph Gordon Levitt) to help him in his work. Now a Japanese corporate giant (Ken Watanabe) wants desperately to destroy his Rupert Murdoch-like rival's son (Cillian Murphy) but has doubts on whether Cobb can work his evil strategies. Therefore, Cobb pushes the envelope. The dream stealer assures the Asian strongman that he can perform ""inception"", that is, he can plant a destructive idea into the rival's brain, during an elaborate dreamscape, and the man will bring himself down. Once again, whew! But, with the stakes so high, Cobb has to gather more assistants, including architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), a male expert on sleep-inducing drugs, and so on. These folks, willing to help, all warn Cobb, however, that failure is likely, for no one has truly been successful at inception before. Ah, but, that's the secret, for someone has and its Cobb. Complicating matters is Cobb's own nightmares about his ex-wife (Marion Cotillard) who not only committed suicide but made it look like Cobb had murdered her. Thus, the dream stealer hasn't seen his two children in months, as he is on the run and can't re-enter the United States. As part of the deal, if Cobb's plans for inception work, he will get a clean slate. Will he be able to deliver? This is a tantalizing film, very heady stuff, that is extremely hard to summarize but which rivets the viewer as all outstanding movies can. Part of its greatness lies in the terrific cast. DiCaprio, fresh out of two fantastic performances in Revolutionary Road and Shutter Island, completes the trilogy with another knockout turn here. He's always had ""the goods"" but his youthful appearance and teeny bopper fans interfered with directors taking him seriously. No more. Cotillard, too, is mesmerizing, for she is beautiful, voluptuous and so, so talented. The rest of the crew is also terrific, with special words of praise for Watanabe, Murphy and, in a very small role, Micheal Caine. The only cast member that seems slightly miscast is Page, but, hey, she makes it work, with a wit and spark that resembles Robert Downey, Jr., pint-sized. But, in addition to the well-chosen cast, the film has very few weaknesses. The story (by writer/director Christopher Nolan), is superb, although complicated, the direction is fast and furious, and the visual effects, including costumes, settings, and stunning camera shots, all work to a powerful end. Would you even dream of skipping this film, serious film fans? I say, no way, Jose. Like the postal service, let no rain, snow, sleet, or dread of night keep you from buying a ticket.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is one the best movies i have ever watched, acting crew are amazing as well as everything in the movie but i don't think this movie should be the top rated movie of all time.the movie is truly an inspiring film where the based on true story makes it more amazing although the movie gets the watching people a little bit cold but all in all i can say its a nice movie. as i was reading trough the other reviews of this movie, i came crossed a review which said and i quote ""The best movies are ones that touch the souls"". i disagree, best movies should be rated according to many aspects but unfortunately the main contributing factor of rating movies nowadays is based on ""other peoples votes"". all in all, i have to say if you haven't watched the movie yet, you are not a movie person",1
"Excellent movie! Of my favorites. It's one of those movies that attracts you and keeps you attentive at all times. Their musical setting is also good. All a work of art in every way.If you do not understand it the first time, it is mandatory to see a second one. Greetings.",1
"When I raad the book in 90's I remember that I was think to my self like ""Wow, if they make it a movie, it would be awesome"".",1
"Yes it can! And I do not say that because I do not like the movie or this kind of movie. It is a great action movie, it satisfies a lot and holds up to the expectations. But it simply is too long. Roughly speaking it is a reiteration of the same scenes over and over. After two hours I just had enough. Dark Knight does not have all the different times and environments as Batman Begins (childhood, Himalaya, etc.). That would justify such a long play time. Dark Knight is just Batman kicking ass in Gotham for 152 minutes.Oh, and before I forget. What were they thinking when picking Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel? Is it just me or is she just too ugly for being Rachel? Don't misunderstand me. I do not want to be rude and its not personal. Maggie is surely the right choice for many other roles, but Jeez, from Katie Holmes to Maggie - what a downfall.Anyways, it is a great movie, no doubt. But lengthiness and wrong Rachel takes away four points in my opinion.",1
"I think this is one of the best mystery-thriller movie ever made in the world. It is strange dark and subtle, has every component of a great cinema.A person challenges to his sanity and insanity concurrently, one can reveal one's abnormal sensitivity to stimulation himself. ""There is a fine line between reality and fiction"" this movie elaborates the sentence. A person can go to any length in order to achieve his goals. You will be forced to maintain the complete attention because you are simply fascinated.Edward Norton gives an outstanding performance as an insomniac and perplexed protagonist. Brad Pitt is charismatic as he possesses an extraordinary ability to attract. Helena Bonham Carter has done a fabulous job (""Dr Jekyll and Mr Jack Ass""). Rest of the gang of the fight club is just fantastic.David Fincher has crafted this movie so finely which is spellbinding until the mystery open after ""Seven"", ""The game"" and ""Insomnia"".Tyler Durden: ""People do it everyday, they talk to themselves... they see themselves as they'd like to be, they don't have the courage you have, to just run with it"".It is one of my all time favorite movie, loved watching this every now and then.",1
"Considering the fact that The Shawshank Redemption is #1 on IMDb, and also considering that it has been drooled upon by so many people over the years, I had high hopes. I've seen it a few times now, I first saw it when I was 13. No issues with the storytelling or character development, but just not as perfect as people say. Still a magnificent film!",1
"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in rural Maine. Andy befriends prison contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decaying library.In 1954, Brooks is paroled, but cannot adjust to the outside world after fifty years in prison and hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in him receiving solitary confinement. After his release from solitary Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens.In 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his G.E.D. exam. In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders Andy was convicted of, implying Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen and sends Andy back to solitary when he mentions the money laundering. Norton then has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him out of his cell into worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months and tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises Andy that if he is ever released he will visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine and retrieve a package Andy buried there. Red becomes worried about Andy's state of mind, especially when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet of rope.The next day at roll call the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall, and the rock tears through the poster. Removing the poster, the warden discovers a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last seventeen years, hidden by posters of starlets Andy acquired from Red over the years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and used the prison's sewage pipe to reach freedom, bringing with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving forty years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.",1

Hats off to Heath ledger One of the Best Joker ever!,1
"this masterpiece was so much more than a batman film, it was clearly one of the best 'crime-thriller-action- drama' epics. One of the movies in my list of ""best in the last 5-10 years."" Far and away the best comic book movie ever made. Heath Ledger was awe inspiring as the maniacal, psychopath Joker. If you ever wanted to know how the joker was suppose to be played, watching Ledger is basically a character study on how it's done. That character is crazed and demented but at the same time he will get you to laugh at the things he is doing. Ledger was everything I could ever want out of the joker and Jack Nicholson's performance NOW seems more like a Ceasar Romero Joker of the 1960s. Aaron Eckhart was just as good as Harvey Dent /Two Face, his transformation from one to the next was so well done. Christian Bale was once again spot on as the Caped Crusader. I loved every part of this cinema masterpiece, there was nothing really flawed about it, everyone was on their A game, and that puts it among my all time favorites. One for the ages! Bob Kane would be so proud!!",1
"Inception is a very good film. Just be aware that you may have to see this movie more than once to grasp the concept of this movie. This movie is designed to get you to think. I was able to understand the movie the first time I saw it and I'm going to see it in the future just for the heck of it.This movie is about a guy named Dom Cobb. His profession is to go in people's mind and steal their top secrets. Wanting to go home, Cobb must break apart the empire of a dying father and his son.The acting is perfect. I would not be surprised if Leonardo DiCaprio gets nominated for an Oscar. The other actors such as Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page were great.The visual effects are outstanding. I know this will be nominated for an Oscar in that category. The score composed by Hans Zimmer is perfect and fits in with the rest of the movie.Overall, this may be the best movie of Summer 2010. I rate this film a perfect 10/10.",1
"Although the movie was released in 1999, I watched this movie just recently, since I don't like that kind of movies with fights and violence. Even if a friend of mine told me about this movie I still was circumspect about it.At first I was confused, and I thought this will pass. Later in the movie, I was more confused, but not disappointed, anyway. Just at the end I understood the whole thing, making me more confused. I had to watch it over and over again to make sure I understood it right.""Fight Club"" is not about violence, is not about that kind of ""fight"". Is not about anarchy or destruction. Is about knowing yourself, is about your capability to understand and structure your own actions, is about being aware of yourself.It's a great movie, which describes the philosophy of life: live your own life, don't live the life of others. You have to watch this mastermind!",1
"all time no 1 masterpiece, Christopher Nolan+Leonardo DiCaprio=the big bang. two hours of endless applause, words cannot describe what i just witnessed. speechless, transcends cinema, easy 11 out of 10, it doesn't get any better than that. made to perfection, did i make myself clear? its like when you know you just found what you have been looking for. a feeling that one single movie has managed to hit home. i think that the script of INCEPTION by Christopher Nolan is out of this world just as Leonardo DiCaprio's craft.there are so many different levels of depth and sophistication to this work of art that you might need to see it a few times in order to fully comprehend the true size of it.and please don't blink...",1

"Well, it's summer movie season my friends, so that means it's time for lots of stupid movies aimed at young kids and teens who are off of school for summer break. Yep, lots of pointless, predictable stories involving lots of unnecessary CGI, animated people, fart jokes, and vampires. However, once in a while we get a great indie filmmaker like Christopher Nolan who doesn't care about trying to make a movie ""popular"" but rather focuses on trying to take his audience on an adventure where we experience thrills we aren't used to experiencing at the movies. Like his other films, Inception relies on stellar performances from its cast, as well as storytelling twists that constantly keep us guessing. However, I think this film surpasses his other films in that in addition to clever storytelling he adds some incredibly imaginative visuals and choreographed action sequences that blow your mind as well as almost knock you out of your seat.One of the challenges of reviewing a science-fiction film like this is that it plays around with time and space. So therefore, it doesn't play by the usual rules of plot and story, since the world it exists in is the subconscious. Therefore, as an audience member you are going to be somewhat frustrated trying to figure out what this movie is ""about."" At the theater I was at today, a few women near me walked out about an hour and a half into the film and never returned, probably because they simply refused to allow the film to take them on this journey into the unknown. I am certain that many, many moviegoers will hate this movie for that reason, since it doesn't have a cut and paste formulaic narrative that they are used to seeing in films. This is basically a low budget art film at its core and soul, with 150 million dollars of production design and special effects sprinkled on top and around the edges. If you go in expecting a simple Hollywood Shoot Em Up script with good guys and bad guys you will be sorely disappointed. This is basically ""The Matrix"" meets ""What Dreams May Come"" meets ""Ocean's Eleven"" on steroids.It would be hard for anyone to spoil the film for you, since if you have heard of it you already know that it is about a group of thieves who have the ability to steal someone's dreams, and the complex consequences that could result by trying to do this. After watching the film, that's pretty much all you understand by the end of it anyways, so you just have to watch the film to experience it for yourself. You will either love it or hate it, depending on what level of creativity and imagination you like to see in films. I say to just allow yourself to appreciate this artistic vision and be taken into this world by the exceptional acting, outstanding storytelling, exciting action, and imaginative visuals. The visuals are actually enough to give this film a fairly high rating on their own. One that especially amazed me was a fight involving Joseph-Gordon Levitt inside a zero-gravity hallway. It's just amazing because it doesn't look like any special effects were used whatsoever. It simply looks like the real actors are floating and fighting in this hallway and climbing up and down walls! I am certain wires were used in some clever way; I just have no idea how. There is also a scene where a locomotive steamrolls down a city street crashing into cars (without any tracks under it), and just like in The Dark Knight truck chase where Nolan actually flipped the Joker's truck for real, you can tell that this stunt was also filmed for real. Last but not least, it is important to note that lost in all this is the fact that DiCaprio gives an incredible performance in this film. Yes, his name is on the top of the movie poster but he is not the star of this. The star of this film is Nolan and his vision, and DiCaprio does a great job of restraining himself from over-doing it so that Nolan can succeed in creating his vision. It would not surprise me to see him get a Best Actor nomination. I also foresee Marion Cotillard getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination. I was mesmerized and spellbound every time she showed up on screen, even though she has a fairly small role overall. She's essentially playing a ghost, but the most beautiful, sexiest, tormented, and scariest ghost a female could ever play. Nolan will also definitely get a Best Director and Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, you can bet on those.CAUTION: Side effects that may result from watching this film may include brain hemorrhages as well as necessary check ups at the psychiatric ward at your local hospital. = )",1
"Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, is my favorite movie of all time. This movie created my love for movies, and even for Batman and the Joker. From the moment that Hans Zimmer's gripping score beings in the opening scene, to the first time we see Heath Ledger give the performance of a lifetime as the clown prince of crime, I was hooked. The setting feels dark, gloomy, and even evil at times, but yet I am compelled to buy a plane ticket to the city. I would like to say that this is because of Batman, that I want to fight the crime in Gotham and be a member of the GCPD (but less corrupt). But the truth is that I want to see the Joker (from a safe distance). The Joker offers such high levels of charisma and dark humor that you don't have to fool yourself by saying you love to hate him. Be honest, you hate that you love him. In this city of corrupt cops, dirty money, white collar crime, and gang activity, who better to look to than someone who makes even the most wicked of people look sane. Nolan has presented a world where the joker isn't so much a mad clown, as he is a mad scientist. Maybe he lacks morals, but even his most convoluted plans are artfully crafted.The Dark Knight is not a comic book movie. The Dark Knight is an action movie based on comic book locations and characters. That seems simple enough, but I stand by the fact that it is the only film of its kind (including the other two in the trilogy). Even the best of comic book movies such as Iron Man or The Avengers, are still very much comic book movies. The Dark Knight was able to rise above that title to become something more than that. Christian Bale gave us the best performance as Bruce Wayne as seen on the big screen to-date, and Heath Ledger gave us possibly the greatest performance of all time as the joker.I do not give this score to films very often, but The Dark Knight is undoubtedly a 10/10.",1
"The Dark Knight excels on every standard that can be attributed to film-making: acting, effects, dialogue, plot, deeper meaning, adrenaline, and the list goes on. Each actor exemplifies their role, a feat that probably has not been seen in any movie to date. However, Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker must be seen to be believed; it is neck and neck with Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance in The Shining as the finest portrayal of insanity ever. The movie provides the perfect amount of The Joker; not too much, nor too little. Just enough to keep you horrified at what he does without him losing his thrill. My only complaint with the acting, if not the entire movie, was that the movie did not really provide a lot of Bruce Wayne, at least in comparison to Batman Begins.The movie provides immense amounts of adrenaline. If you are looking for the high-tension summer effects blockbuster of the year, this is it.Despite its fast pace, The Dark Knight still has a rich plot, and the dialogue is riddled with subtle humor, pointers, and more. Where the movie truly excels is in its toying with fundamental philosophical questions about morality vs amorality, goodness, fairness, and chaos vs order.On all levels, The Dark Knight is a fantastic movie, and is the most complete movie ever made in terms of being a movie that is most satisfying in the most ways. At the very least it is far and away the best superhero movie of all time. Is it one of the finest movies ever made? See it and decide for yourself. I can't promise you that you will think so; I CAN promise you that your ticket money and time will not be wasted. This movie has something for everyone. Don't miss out.",1
"Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a big and bold production. The great special-effects, sharp editing and affecting score sweep the film into a high-entertainment package. It is a vast improvement on Batman Begins reaching a higher level of storytelling. Although there are self-evident inadequacies in the script this is a breakthrough film. The Dark Knight is a long film, and in this respect it surprisingly fails somewhat to provide enough depth. Instead we do get scenes where the obvious ineptitude of the police enable the plot to continue as it wishes. For example, why is a police officer in the same cell as The Joker when it was entirely unnecessary? It therefore sometimes falls more into a comic book experience conflicting unfortunately with the superior film elements. However,if this can be forgiven (as I have) Nolan has produced a successful cross-over from his somewhat comic book feature of Batman Begins. Heath Ledger is stunning as The Joker providing the emotional context and thrills. The set-pieces are as grand as they are gripping.A minor point, which I could not get away from was a particular moment when Bale is discussing gadgets with Freeman, was this just me or did anyone else feel like we were watching a James Bond and Q moment?The Dark Knight is a breakthrough film it is more majestic and gripping than any of its Batman predecessors. It is a superior film of entertainment only hampered by its over long-running time but ultimately it is a triumph.",1
"Work does not represent you, bank deposits do not represent you, the car you drive does not represent you, the things in your wallet do not represent you, clothes do not represent you, you are just one of the ordinary beings",1
"My gosh, where to begin with this movie.....practically everything was nailed, spot-on. The story is as compelling and ultimately uplifting as one will ever find in cinema -- from the very get-go we see Andy Dufresne in a courtroom, being sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two people. So instinctively, we believe this must be true -- after all the judge did rule him guilty, right? But over time Andy grows on us, until we learn of his actual innocence, and by the end of the movie one can't help but root him on in his pursuit of freedom. Tim Robbins is the perfect assignment to play Andy, as Robbins' lesser-known status as an actor (as opposed to Tom Hanks, who was considered for this role) eases his task of being the quiet, tranquil Andy who prefers to keep to his own business. Andy's easygoing yet pensive nature makes him the ideal protagonist, as he is an independent thinker yet he can peacefully interact with all others.His friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) is the backbone of The Shawshank Redemption. Red, a contraband smuggler, may be different from Andy in almost all respects, but over the years Andy earns Red's respect through his acts of courage and selflessness. This movie teaches that title does not have to dictate behavior -- a man who is in prison can be as kind and generous as anyone outside of prison walls -- it all depends on how far you're willing to look into that man's heart. I also love the fact that the friendship of the two men heightens very gradually -- that seems far more realistic than the instant-friends that one often sees in all mediums of story telling. This one takes time to develop, creating a profundity in the relationship and contributing to one of the movie's themes (time). This theme teaches us how much things can change over time, and also lends to the purported notion that Andy and Red have been in prison for a very long time.Red's narration is one of the standout features of The Shawshank Redemption. It is both poignant and insightful, allowing us unlimited access to his mind, which makes our empathy for him so real. While in most other films we learn about characters only through dialogue, in this one Red divulges practically everything to us. His abandonment of hope and eventual love for Andy makes him a tragic figure that should pull at the heartstrings of all viewers. When we first see him attempt to receive parole in 1947, he seems to be no more than an unfeeling criminal. But by 1967 when he's trying to leave Shawshank Prison after 40 years of incarceration, we hang on every word of his memorable ""rehabilitated"" speech. And when he meets Andy on the beach in the final scene, and the two peacefully embrace with a hug as the camera fades away, it is hard to hold back tears of joy.A significant aspect of this film is its theme of institutionalization. We are made to scrutinize exactly what prison does to people. How does a man adapt to freedom again, once he has been released? All Brooks Hatlen could land was a job as a grocery bagger and a room in a halfway house. This inauspicious lifestyle, plus the insecurities of being away from familiar faces while among all the technological/social changes since the start of his 50-year sentence, overwhelmed Brooks, as we all saw in a speechlessly dramatic suicide scene. Red lived in much the same fear before he decided to take off and cross the border to visit Andy. So we're forced to ask ourselves: does even a finite prison sentence essentially end the free will of its recipient? Is it better to leave the inmate in prison in certain cases? This cuts deeply into the philosophy of society's legal system.But the overarching theme of The Shawshank Redemption is hope. Hope is a wonderful, vital virtue that should never be absent in any human heart. Andy echoes this through his audacious acts (be it offering financial advice to Hadley or playing classical music over the prison intercom (which is one of the finest scenes you will ever see in cinema)). He vocalizes his faith in hope to his inmates when he claims that his two weeks in solitary confinement were the ""easiest"" he'd ever done, all thanks to the music he kept in his head. He tells Red ""get busy living, or get busy dying"" and uses the death of Brooks as his evidence, much to Red's initial chagrin. Yes, Andy is built into an icon for hope in this movie, and that is what makes it so universally successful in its appeal. Hope can and should be adopted by every human being who graces the earth. This notion is expressed through Andy's entire struggle, as well as in Thomas Newman's incredible musical score for the film (which is so good it has been used in multiple movie trailers before to evoke emotional response). This precious lesson, told through a film in which literally everything is perfectly mastered, is what makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films ever made.",1
"Look at the Polls on this site. Liking the movie is age based. I'm retired and while I liked it, I wasn't enthralled by it. After awhile CGI is CGI.It is a movie in which one has to surrender disbelief about disbelief about disbelief. While the layers are fascinating on a quick intellectual basis, they soon become ludicrous to believe in.The real problem I had is that there is way to much linear action for it to resemble any dream sequence of mine, but I understand that having a rapidly morphing and unworldly scenario would simply befuddle and irritate. I did like the ""is he or isn't he"" twist at the end.Sort of a mission impossible on LSD.",1
Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite films of all time. The story of Andy Dufresne characterizes the ups and downs of humanity.,1
"I will like to say that it is a true master piece. Anyone above 13 will enjoy it if he/she understands the first half. It might take time for some people but you just need to go through carefully make sure you understand the theories.Firstly it'll open with like what is happening! then the movie will make you understand actually what is going on. Then a plan will be formed to fulfill an objective which is very important for certain character with a lot of stories to be told and then the adventure goes on through everyone's mind including you!At the end, Mr. Nolan gives it away to you, to decide, With what ending thought you'll be comfortable with. It's up to you mate. I took it positively. Just watch the film and hope you will become an nolanian too if you're not already. Very good acting by all casts as well as the effects were astonishing and epic. This is the best Sci-Fi movie ever made. Simply, the best. The deeper you go, it gets more paradoxical. The more you watch, the more it gets better. Never boring. Thanks for reading.",1
"Best Film Of The Year I went to see The Dark Knight on its first day of it coming out and for the first time ever i went back to see it again.And I would like to see it again.It was an amazing film from the beginning to the end. Usually in two and a half hours i would get bored of the film but for once i didn't i was entertained all the way through. Filled with action and suspense.The bit i loved the best was Heath Ledger's acting as the Joker. The way he played it was inspiring.Most of the time i would find something bad about the film , and i've tried hard to but i cant its perfect 5/5 Five out of Five Heath Ledger R.I.P",1
"I finally caved in to the hype about this movie and sat down to watch it. And now I know what all the fuzz was about.""Inception"" is simply put a groundbreaking movie for our times, just like ""Matrix"" was back in 1999.The story told in ""Inception"" is very captivating and you get really caught up in the events as they unfold. The story is the type that grips you tight and takes you on one amazing thrill ride. I will not go into depth about the actual storyline, but the notion about going into another person's subconscious and dreams is quite interesting. And going in there to plant the seed of a new idea is even more interesting. Enough said.As for the cast in ""Inception"", well that was simply phenomenal. Lots of really good performances done here, but of course, we are dealing with good actors and established names here. Of course Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role as Cobb. I haven't been much fond of his previous work, but since ""Shutter Island"", he has really started to become noticeable (for me at least). And his performance in ""Inception"" was right on the money, very nice indeed. Of course, he wasn't the sole carrier of the movie, he was well helped along by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, playing Arthur, and he was really standing out on the screen. He did such a super job with his character, and I think he was the one actually carrying the heavy load of the movie. Then there was Ellen Page, playing Ariadne, which was quite an interesting role to see her in. Actually, the list goes on and on with really good actors here, such as Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, and so on.What appealed to me about the movie was the concept of the entire story. Of being able to go into a person's mind and influence his dreams and thoughts. However unlikely it may be, it still came off quite nice on the screen.A movie like this is nothing without special effects. And ""Inception"" sure had a bunch of really nice effects along the way. There were some really mind-boggling CGI effects going on at places. And the effects also had a huge part to do with the final outcome of the movie.Despite it being a rather long movie, the time does fly by as you watch it, because you are so caught up in the story. And that was really great, film-making when it is best; entertainment that makes you forget all about time and space. And ""Inception"" is definitely a movie that you need to get around to watch if you haven't already seen it. This is a movie that will redefine movie making in the future.Thumbs up, way up, for this impressive movie.",1
"It's quite hard to even start rating this film as it is just simply ""Incredible""!
The acting cast was amazing, the producer did an amazing job with the individuals he picked for each role.
I watched this movie in the theatre many years ago and purchased the VHS tape as soon as it became available. Did the same when it was released on DVD and have watched it many times over. Well worth it.Don't deny yourself the pleasure of this movie. If you haven't seen it by now, stop wasting time, get it, own it and greatly enjoy it.",1
"Yeah i liked it. The twist really hit me. The violence didn;t. There are a million more violent movies. SPR for one.i thought direction wasn;t perfect, but the story was strong enough to make it still a top movie.",1
"This movie gets you out of any bad mood to a state of serenity, Every conversation got deep meanings inside of it. The Shawshank redemption was made to inspire all of us to never ever give up. The cast just fit right in their roles their voices move the right feelings in the right time. Tim Robbins gave his best performance of all time the way he talks and walks reflects his calm personality in the movie with a smile always on his face. Morgan freeman was great as usual specially as a narrator. excellent performance and great story sets an example of friendship and hope. A must see for everyone.",1
"Wow... and I thought nothing could be better than ironman or x-men movies. Most people might think Batman Begin was pretty good, but boy... Dark Knight is 10 times better than Batman Begin. Action wise, story wise, humor wise, character development wise...., and the Joker... geezz.. he is the most scariest bad guy in any superhero movies I have seen so far. This movie is definitely not intended for kiddies. It is full of violence, twists, and actions. They have cast the right people for the right roles in this movie. I was most impressed by Heath Ledger's acting, very convincing as a psychopath killer. All the hypes you heard about this movie are all true... Before I watched Dark Knight, I had a very high expectation, but boy? believe it or not, this movie actually exceed my expectation. I would definitely watch it again once it comes out on DVD. It really worth every cent I spent on the ticket. 4 thumbs up (including my toes ^__^) for this movie.",1
"Watching fight club is like watching a version of yourself without inhibitions, fear or considerations. Not necessarily the best qualities humanity possess, but those that we repress within ourselves for the good of society. Fight Club is a release, to enjoy the brutality and the masochistic urges that comes very occasionally. Of course it's message is abhorrent and we must never allow ourselves to turn into this, but every now and then, we all need to let our self-destructive side out. This film allows me to do it in a safe environment, that's why it's so brilliant.Part of every man wants to be like Tyler Durden, It should never happen, but it's okay to dream.",1
"While not a bad film i am a little bemused how it has such a high rating. I think 7 out of 10 is about fair as it is pretty far from being original. While watching, it continually reminded me of other movies. From any recent James bond film to 'Total recall' to 'The Matrix' to 'Strange Days'. Its all been done before! And to be given a higher score than such greats as 'The Shining' 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' or 'Deer Hunter' is just plain wrong. Maybe a certificate over a '12a' would of helped it, but i'm still not convinced.Where as i can think of several films in the past 5 years that would of benefited from a higher certificate. Hollywood needs to realise you cant please all of the people all of the time...And thats OK! Don't make what would of been a good 18 certificate movie in to a '12a' or '15' just because it appeals to more people...After all, movies are an art form and art is subjective AND objective",1
"Undoubtable the best superhero story ever told on film. Directing, scoring, effects are all superb. All the acting is excellent. All the performances were excellent. Heath Ledger was insanely scary good. I'm not sure that Oscar will recognize a character in a supporting villain superhero flick, but it's deserved.If the film has any flaw, it is the pacing in the center of the film. It is a little long, at 2 1/2 hours. But the story is very intelligently crafted, and I don't see how it could have been cut.Some of the scenes are dark, just like the title would suggest. I don't think its a spoiler to say that clever camera work was used to avoid showing some violence. But there is still some disturbing violence suggested, and there are some disturbing images. I would think twice before taking younger children.",1
"The Dark Knight - The mob responds to the Batman (Christian Bale)'s actions by bringing in a psychopath named The Joker (Heath Ledger) to wreak havoc and corruption. Both sides look to newly appointed District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) as a focal point. To Batman, Dent is a White Knight whose reign allows Bats the chance to give up the cape and cowl. To the Joker, Dent is a target.I won't lie. I'm a huge Batman fan. And I wholeheartedly enjoyed this movie. But I think that this may be a dangerous case of the hype engine in overdrive. I think I may have liked Batman Begins more. I can't tell yet. It's neck and neck. One visible problem is Batman's reduced role in the movie. Yes he's doing stuff, most of it is very cool (Where's the Batarang action though?). And I like how they delved more into the detective side of his character. But there are fewer moments of introspect than in Begins. The first third or so of the movie is Batman's movie, but the rest belongs to the ""freaks"" as it goes on. It's more about the villain's response to Batman's actions, making a third film so richly deserved. Whether Nolan is willing to crank another one out (and It's getting really tiresome how he keeps hanging the prospect over our heads) remains to be seen. But man I hope so.There's no slight in the performances. Bale is in top form, though the material focuses less on him. Michael Caine is similarly great and side-lined. Heath Ledger is spectacular; the hype engine surrounding him is well justified. The little touches he adds. The twitches, the lip-smacks, the cruel sense of humor. It's perfection. He's ten times the Joker Jack Nicholson was. I wish there was more of him in the film, and I think they might have reduced his part. You just even forget he's under the make-up. It's a snowflake of a performance that will never be repeated.Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent very well. He's very likable and tragic, and Nolan got his origin bang on. I almost wish he had saved it for another film. Maggie Gyllenhall is a far better actress than Katie Holmes. Not just as Rachel Dawes, but in general. And Gary Oldman kicks ass as Commissioner Gordon. Cillian Murphy has a welcome cameo. The action sequences kick ass. I'd be hard pressed to say my favorite scene, and since no one wants spoilers I really shouldn't say.The ending is dark and interesting and dissatisfying all in one. The reboot can't end with this film. There's more to be had. And it would be so easy to transpose Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (mostly) into the conclusion for this film. One can only hope. Don't leave us hanging Chris! A-",1
"I really enjoyed this amoral romp despite the violence which had a cartoon-comedy quality to it anyway and was not (despite the title) the focus of the film.It is a very good film to watch on video because the immediate response is to look at it again once you know who Jack actually is to see how the whole thing works.And ""Marla Singer"" was brilliant and rather a departure for Helena Bonham Carter.I do not know if the film is the origin of the phrase, ""don't beat yourself up!""",1
"Whoah! The current juggernaut that is The Dark Knight has been breaking records and causing fervor amongst movie goers and particularly, I see, voters here on IMDb. Is this really worth an average score on IMDb of 9.4 (as of July 30)? Of the top 10 highest rated movies on IMDb, does this deserve to be among them? I saw it in a packed movie theater, with a great cross-section of people, but mostly tweens, teens, and people up to around 30's, and at the end of it, rather than a big cheer, or round of applause or mumbling of contentment and positive comments there was just silence as every one left. I don't think it was a good stunned silence in awe of what they saw, more of a silence whilst we all wondered what the fuss was about.Is it a good movie? Yeah, but better than the first? Nah, not really, just as good but not mind blowingly better. So, what do I consider to be the reason the people I saw it with didn't think it was worth all the fuss? Well from here on in be spoilers.First off, it's too long. The first half zips along at a nice pace, but then from the point where Harvey Dent is burned and becomes Two-face, it drags on and on and on. Around 1 hour 20 the tweens in the audience started to get bored, around 1 hour 40 the teens started to get bored, and around 2 hours the rest of us started to wish it would end already! Also, talking of Two-face, a lot was said and hyped about how gruesome he looked. Nah, not at all. When the ""look"" was revealed, nobody screamed, some actually laughed at it, and the groups of girls behind us commented ""that looks stupid"". And what's with the need for so many villains in movies these days. The marketing campaign makes you think this is a Joker movie, so why bring Two-face into it, why isn't one bad guy enough? There's also a small appearance by Scarecrow too, which isn't really necessary. It's like they said ""Well, Spider-Man 3 had 3 villains, we must match that."" What about Heath Ledger as the Joker, is he as scary as people say? Is it as great a performance as people say? Well he's watchable, but better than Jack Nicholson's take on it? No, not for me. Not scary either really. I didn't feel this was a real madman at work. Worthy of an Oscar? No way man, I mean if you lost an Oscar to this guy for this performance you'd have to be seriously upset. It would be a gesture at best, and a political correctness one at that.It's been said that the movie was based on Heat, in the way the whole cop double cross story line pans out, but I'd say you can clearly see ideas from many movies in here. The whole last fight scene with the ""sonar vision"" reminded me of the ending of Daredevil, and neither of them are good scenes or easy to follow. The Hong Kong scene made me think of Mission: Impossible, and the whole scene about choosing who to save (Harvey Dent or Rachel Dawes) is similar to Spider-Man, and Batman 3, it's not a new concept and you also know what will happen because you've seen these scenes before.The action scenes are OK, but it's pretty hard to tell whats going on because of all the jump cutting, but the main thing is that Batman never really has a decent fight. He seems to dispatch the foes to easily, there's no struggle to any of his fights, and the action sequences are too short for me. They feel like they're setting up for one cool bit of action, but then they're over again and the final fight scene is a big monster of a fight scene either, it's not the best saved till last concept going on here, the best scene is half-way through with Batman on the Bat-bike chasing down the Joker in the truck.Finally, the story line. It's OK and all, but it's quite repetitive, as there are several separate scenes which spell out how we make a choice between good and evil, how we have to choose to be good. Yeah, we got it already the first time, and it's this repetition of this concept in the scenes that make the movie drag out.So, overall, is it a good movie? Yes, definitely watchable. Better than Batman Begins? No, not for me, if I had a choice to watch Batman Begins or the Dark Knight again, I'd choose Batman Begins. Best comic book movie adaptation ever, as I see one commentator say on here? Not the best, no, but better than most. Worth a 9.4 score on IMDb? NO WAY, that's the studio marketing machine driving that right now, I think it will come down when people calm down. Who knows, I'm sure studio people log on and push votes up, and I know I for one was waiting for this to come out and think it's one of the best movies to come out so far, but you need to not let that influence your voting. So, great movie, but not as great as people say, just don't go in expecting to see the greatest movie ever.",1
"Probably the best Batman film. As from the start, viewers can easily enter the world thanks to director Christopher Nolan who tells the story in a very down to earth way- not as a science fictional movie like others Batman films were. The dialogues themselves are extremely relevant. It seems that anyone who listen to them and even not looking at the screen can understand that this is a great film. All the major actors are excellent. As for Ledger, this is his best performance ever.",1
It was a film that deserved all the awards and praise. thanks christopher nolan,1
"One of the finest films ever made. This jockeys for 1st or 2nd in my all time list, depending on when I'm asked. This movie is a thoughtful, poignant and brutally honest examination of the human experience in the face of extreme adversity.The overall theme boils down to ""Don't give up hope"" and that the evidence of that hope is the focusing of one's will into a sheer, unstoppable weapon for change. Andy is a wonderfully rounded out and active protagonist who you root for even before you know him well.This movie has been played repeatedly on cable, but do yourself a favor and watch the unedited version. Bring tissue in case dirt gets in your eye.",1
"Tyler Durden is one of the greatest Inner Characters that u will see in an human being. This Movie brings out the psychological and Social aspect in an World Where u can find yourself in an 9-5 Job, stressful, depressed and angry about your Life and ur social Society. U dont Need Money to be free Is the Slogan that delivers so much Power and Emotion in this Movie. Great Performance by the Actors also This Movie Is a must have",1
"I was there ... I was there with Red, he walked through a warm, sunny field, against the wall by which he had a ""compass"" left by him, the closest person in the world.
I looked at the TV screen and felt the smell of grass, I could smell the air in this field, I could taste the freedom. This story touches, not speculating in feelings, but makes you experience fear, pain, peace, freedom and a sense of hope.",1
"This Movie May just be Americas Greatest Cinematic Achievement ... well close to. The acting was phenomanol. Christopher Nolan has done it again , first with The Dark Knight and now , Inception. Although Leo Decaprio may have disappointed us before this time it is different , he takes it to the philosophical point of view. Which I found so interesting. The Special Effects were Mind-Blowing !!! Jordan oh whatever his last name is was really good he was like the albert einstein of this movie. Every part of this movie was put together perfectly ... Except one. The only thing that makes me put a 9 out of 10 is that it was a bit confusing at parts the end makes you think about what happens. So all in all see this movie !!!",1
"To me this is one of the classic. The story of a is unique prison break but with a lot of drama and suspense. Spiritually moving old-fashioned prison movie. I loved it. All the character got their own uniqueness and importance. Overall you have to watch it to feel it. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed. So, yeah I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.",1
This movie is so good that it convinced people that the whole trilogy is good. It's not. Just this one is. And honestly it stands alone pretty well so just watch it and skip the others.,1
"The dark knight is a masterpiece. This is art..before going to the theater I decided to take a look at the comments on IMDb so I could have at least an idea of what this movie would offer..I was a bit surprised when I saw such amazing comments on this website, even surpassing The godfather on the top250, so I went like ""well, this new version must be just overrated"" Oh my god! it should not be considered to be a superhero movie..this is so much more than that..it is a well paced thriller, crime movie..it doesn't matter if you go to the cinema with high expectations or you just lower them..at the end you'll be completely blown away..what can I say about the Joker? this guy is a freakin' terrorist..I'm sorry Mr Nicholson, I admit you did really good as the joker in Batman 1989, but after seeing this...all I can say to you is that before you die you should watch this movie..I wouldn't dare to put it as the greatest movie ever made, but I'm sure it is a complex, dark and unforgettable experience that will leave you breathless once you leave the theater..if you are a Batman fan, The dark knight will affect your life..if you're only trying to have a good time and see a solid action flick, you won't be disappointed..ladies and gentlemen, the best film of 2008!!",1
"As I went to the midnight premier of Dark Knight I had a sense going in I kind of knew what to expect. And man was i ever so wrong about that. This movie was so flawless the movie critics couldn't find anything wrong with it. Heath Ledger is the best Jocker ever hands down, beating Jack Nicholson by a land slide.If Heath doesn't win the Academey Award for the best supporting Actor then this will be robbery in the second degree. Christopher Nolans is a genius to boot, he puts seriousness and darkness into a comic book movie, cause i referred to the past Batmans except Batman Begins, as corny and not very thought out. All in all all I loved this movie I have seen it about four times that how good this movie is, it is a master piece, it is flawless, it is compelling, it is down right good, so give this movie a look more than once its worth it.",1
"Best Movie Ever That i Watched On The Universe
It is an unusual remark to make about a film set inside a jail, however ""The Shawshank Redemption"" makes a warm hang on our sentiments since it makes us an individual from a family. Numerous motion pictures offer us vicarious encounters and speedy, shallow feelings. ""Shawshank"" backs off and looks. It utilizes the storyteller's quiet, attentive voice to incorporate us in the narrative of men who have shaped a network in the slammer. It is more profound than most movies; about coherence in a lifetime, in view of companionship and expectation.",1
I ALWAYS WATCH IT AND IT CAME TO SLEEP I WAKE HAVING DREAMS ABOUT THE MOVIE LAST NIGHT AND NOT ONLT I WAS IN IT MAKING MY OWN DECSIONS IT GAVE ME ROOM TO INVENT MY OWN PERSON,1
"i remember seeing previews for fight club and thinking that it looked like a cool movie about guys who fight a lot. i did not see it at first, but when i did, i was very pleasantly surprised. Not only is this movie about guys who like to fight, it is the story of a nameless-insomniac-narrator who finds refuge by going to meetings for disease stricken people. When Marla Singer ruins that, he meets a man named tyler durden that changes his life forever. they start an underground fight club and tyler takes him for the ride of his life, having the narrator discover who he really is. this movie is a dark thrill ride that ventures to question many of the staples in today's society. Based on the first novel by chuck palahniuk (who by the way is the best writer going, if you haven't yet, read more of his books i.e. choke and survivor etc.), this movie is easily my favorite ever and is a piece of art put together by the best minds in the business. i give David fincher the thumbs up for his excellent adaptation of a classic novel.",1
"This movie has all of the aspects you would expect of a great film. Based on Stephen King's short story, this tale of hope and loss, friendship and betrayal is nothing shy of magical. Your heart bleeds for Andy through his troubles with the sisters and then sings when he is finally free. You feel the hatred for the warden and the screws, while crying for the lost life of Brooks. I have seen so many different movies in my life and can honestly say, 100%, without a doubt that this beautifully crafted piece of art is hands down my all time favorite. I can watch Tim Robbins stroll through the yard and listen to Morgan Freeman narrate over and over. If you came to my house right new with a bag of popcorn and some wine with a copy of this in your hand, we would be besties for life.",1
"This film is NOT the best of the decade, people  (Note Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption), but it is really darn good.  The visuals are the best depiction of surreal, gritty darkness since Dark City. The acting is superlative for both Norton and Pitt.  Both HAVE done better work (American History X & 12 Monkeys, respectively), but each is energetic and very believable in their roles.  I could have done without Helena Bonham Carter completely, though it was exciting to see her playing against Edwardian type...  The Dust Brothers soundtrack works very nicely.
To dispell a myth, this movie is NOT the most ultraviolent ever.  The homosexual rape of Pulp Fiction, the surreal psycho-sexual assaults and torture of Clockwork Orange and of course the martial carnage of Saving Pvt. Ryan all exceed the batterings of Fight Club, in both graphic detail and the overall ability to disturb the viewer.The ""twist"" at the end of the film is sort of old hat material to anyone with any sort of experience with philosophy (read Descartes, Twain's ""Mysterious Stranger,"" or even watch the Matrix), but is nonetheless quite unpredictable.  The rebellion against corporate cubicle-generated consumeristic furniture catalogue materialism springs from the same frustration that fueled Falling Down and even Dilbert comics.  This is just far more visceral.A great film of the 90's and worth seeing for anyone 18-30 who has by this time become quite innured to cinematic violence.  :)",1
I saw batman all parts. All are amazing. The voices and actions impressed me a lot. Story was also good. I saved its all parts to watch again. worth seeing because children or young both like this movie.,1
"This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, This is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite movie ranked in my top 5 list. The movie is based in a prison, where violence, sexual references and profanity are part of the daily life. The story line is excellent with great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman especially. I have watched this movie over 20 times and still enjoy it every time I see it just as much as the first time.",1
"What can I add to all the other reviews here? Just my own feelings about this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times, emotionally, I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves around in my head, heartbroken, paranoid and not well physically. Total mess.My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. I initially resisted, thinking it was going to be lightweight, PC fare. I don't know why I thought that.There's a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see what kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time, and you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison, and I think by then you're hooked.This scene is deeply moving, not least because of the music. It's difficult to see how Thomas Newman's music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in it's own right, but when you do you're reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun, enjoying their first beer for so long. They've been touched by Andy's kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown back in one's face, but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also full of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a triumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling, but as I watched the end I could not contain my tears, unusually.So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me, and no doubt for many others",1
"Well what can I say? This film is amazing. It has everything that an MTV generation boy or girl could want, all neatly packaged in this gem of a movie. I must say the book was amazing, I loved it, it really gave some fresh ideas to life, and why we act the way we act. But i feel the movie is a better medium in which to show this to mass audience. First things first, every actor in this film is marvellous, a joy to watch. Edward Norton is God, when it comes to really nailing a character and slipping into a role, he is close to DeNiro. Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto all are a pleasure to watch. But I must say this film is about one man, Tyler Durden... ladies and gentlemen... Brad Pitt rocked in this. I could never possibly imagine anybody else in this role, he magnificently slips into a potentially hypocritical role, looking good and acting the part, my hats off. What makes this film so great, naturally the twist is always important and a real brain teaser, is just how glorious it is after you realize the truth. On second viewing you pick up more details, the tiniest of things that just make the film worth watching over and over again. But most important is its visual flare. It is as if we are in the mind of Jack the narrator - take your pick] The constant jumping back, going forward, skipping to and throw, picking up were he left off, it represents beautifully what a modern mans life is like, full of constant hectic day to day monotomous work routines, all becoming slaves to the fashion and food industry, as if image were really the most important aspect in life. This is a rant on capitalism, and all the better for it, me and my friends enjoy it particularly for that reason, because it laughs in the face of democracy, not in an attempt to [as some American critics failed to understand] promote Fascism as an idealised movement, but just to stand there and say ""Hey this is what's wrong, I don't like this and that, F**k you and your rules, lets do something worth living about."" It really tunes into modern perceptions of life: Work, Sex, Fashion, Religion and Security... and just really mixes them around. I came out of the cinema bedazzled by the whole look of the film, but watch it again and enjoy it for what it really has to offer... everything.",1

"The movie just captivates the viewer from start to finish. Morgan Freeman as ""Red"" is just perfect and gets the viewers attention from the start. Just a great story, told in a smooth line and stays interesting. Plot twists, double crossings, pin-up posters are all there. The book written by Stephen King adapts well to the screen and it deserves all the credit that is due. Its a long movie, which never gets old and never gets boring. Some well known actors are included, familiar faces and new faces. This movie has it all. In abundance. There is a reason I am a huge fan of Morgan Freeman and this movie was pretty much the start of it all. A brilliant actor, a compelling story, what more can you ask for in a movie that is set in a prison. Shear brilliance.",1
"This is my subjective view of the film. I don't suppose that any opinion about a movie should be based on analytical reasoning. Rather, the response should come from the heart and focus on the feelings the movie elicit. After all, the medium of motion picture is to do with emotions of people more than the critical acclaim and awards.I love every scene of the movie. The message of the movie resonates more and more as the time progresses. You can take anything you want from the movie. No matter what kind of situation you find yourself in your life or the personal crisis you are dealing with, this movie will help you.In the 20th anniversary interview, the director has said about the viewer mails he received about the redemptive power of the movie. This holds true for a long time. I think it will hold true for a long time to come. The most poignant message of the film is about hope, consistency and perseverance. This themes are the focus of many great films. But none lifts the spirits of the viewer like this movie does.WATCH IT OFTEN AND STAY POSITIVE. MORE OF A FRIENDLY COMPANION THAN A MOVIE.",1
"Heath Ledger, like James Dean, had the misfortune to die before his talents could be truly appreciated on the big screen. In the case of Dean, only one of his three great roles appeared before his untimely death. While he was a bit more prolific, Ledger's greatest work is only now being comprehended by film-goers. His larger-than-life genesis of The Joker can only be described as legendary. I believe it will stand the test of time as the definitive portrayal of Batman's true nemesis. Sadly, this will likely mean no more Joker in Christopher Nolan's franchise.Making the creative choice of minimal make-up, unkempt appearance, and no back-story, Ledger, with Nolan, births a Joker whose pathology is genuine, whose menace is as oppressive a part of the dark canvas as the cityscape of Gotham, and is yet tempered with a child-like, and infectious sense of play. Early in the film, his ""magic trick,"" in which he makes a pencil disappear, had a packed, noontime audience at the Hollywood Arclight theatre howling. And every appearance after that simply built upon the audience's relish. Throw in a perfect Joker cackle, and Heath secures eternal identification with this role. It sits on the mantle proudly as his best work. It's also the best Batman film ever, bar none. Ledger's phenomenal performance in no way eclipses the flawless work of the other world- class actors sharing the screen, most notably Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. It helps their talents in no small measure to have a powerful, intelligent and unpretentious script.To briefly digress: We in America (or at least our media) tend to get stuck in our ways -- ""oldies radio"" still plays the same 100 songs they have played for the last 30 years; even on satellite TV, there is nothing good on during the day; and souvenir shop windows on Hollywood Boulevard are still full up with James Dean, Marilyn and Elvis. But there are decades worth of performers who are more than pretenders to the Mount Rushmore of talent the above three always seem to monopolize. Forget that many of the best crop of actors in the 21st century are British, or from one of the other colonies. It IS a new century after all, and a global culture, and while it still behooves many Americans to have home- grown deceased icons of stage, screen and jukebox they can display in velvet over their mantelpieces next to Dale Earnhardt, it's just not realistic. Most people under the age of forty have never seen ""Giant,"" or ""Viva Las Vegas"". This in no way deflates the star power or the accomplishments of the Holy Trinity. But aside from his ""dreamy"" voice and classic (or classical) records - which at this point in history belong in a bin next to Pavarotti, rather than PIL - Elvis Presley did not earn his Christ-like status through much more than charisma and chutzpah. Hold any of his films (with the possible exception of ""Jailhouse Rock"") up against ""The Dark Knight"". Go ahead. Do it. I'm getting some TNT and a crew up there on Hollywood's Mount Rushmore. I'll rappel down the face myself and carve out a NEW row of icons, for the new Millennium.On the basis of his body of work, capped so beautifully by his portrayal of the Joker, Heath Ledger deserves some consideration -- in my humble opinion -- for a spot on the hill.",1
"Masterpiece. There's no doubt. But answering to the comments about its perfection, I have to say, as a comic fan, that its fails cannot be ignored. And if we talk about perfection and fails, the main theme is obviously the Joker. Undoubtedly, a perfect performance by Heath Ledger, rest in peace, but also a great but unfaithful reinvention of Joker's physical appearance by Nolan (read ""The Killing Joke"" by Alan Moore). The makeup, the scars, the hair, the pose... and yet, a great character, resulting in a brilliant script which turns even comical in a psychotic way. The ""funny chaos"" created by the Joker, simply awesome. And so is the photography, and the cast, and the soundtrack... everything. And that makes it the best superhero movie ever, beating Watchmen and Batman Begins as the main competitors. Finally, I have to say that I'm happy to see such a great (and dark) ending for such a great film, in which Batman finally becomes, as said by James Gordon, a Dark Knight. To sum up, dark, comical, psycothic, brilliant. Perfect? Judge by yourselves.",1
"The story-line was well thought out and had great flow. Morgan Freeman was top notch, as always. A suspenseful thriller with plot twists that will keep you guessing all movie long. Lighting was good. Composition of shots were well put together. Character dialog was appropriate for all scenes. Supporting actors fit their roles well. Do not miss out on this one. Classic film. Must see. Tim Robbins plays a great co-star role. Morgan and Tim work well with one another. Director Frank Darabont did a great job. Stephen King, as always, wrote a script that will make any avid movie watcher want to continue watching his films. WOW!",1
"One of the best title of Chris , this movie expressed the correct emotions of batman",1
"Can't talk, go and watch it ! Coz here I know the Rule No. 1 !",1
"I just had the chance to catch Fight Club last night.  Awesome stuff.  The whole movie really puts a perspective on the nature of our ""modern"" civilization.  This is one of those movies that you sort of get the first time you watch it, but have to return for a second time to get the full picture.  I highly recommend it.  One of the best flicks I have seen this year.",1
"This movie is just a masterpiece, the best comic book based Movie, The best Superhero movie",1
"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.",1
"The Dark Night is amazing. I have seen it three times already and I am going to see it again.I didn't like Batman Begins. I thought that the action was to fast and it cut away to much. This film still does that but it is easier to tell what is going on.The acting is great. Christian Bale is the best batman yet.Every time I think of Alfred I now see Micheal Caine. The real star of the show is Heath Ledger as the Joker. He is creepy, psychotic, and funny in a very twisted way.2 1/2 hours may seem long but it flies by. This is the best film I have seen so far this year.",1
This is defiantly one of the best films out there. From the writing of it to the acting to filming of it. Everything is on point. It's one of those films you can watch over and over again and still enjoy it every time.Also there is a reason why it took so many Oscars and nominations. I have not met a person who has seen the movie and has not liked it or said something negative about the movie. It's the execution of the film that makes it so great. The story is quite simple but you watch it and are completely captivated by it. The acting is just completely phenomenal. The characters are so real and unique in every way.,1
"One of the best movies i have ever seen, Heath Ledger plays an amazing role. This movie from start to finish is just a masterpiece and the acting is superb. Everyone should watch this.",1
"I enjoyed every moment of this movie. The Villain, Joker, was more than a bad guy. He had a purpose : NOTHING.",1
"I remember when i was back in the 08. The Dark Knight its a movie that everyone can think its about The Joker. Well The Joker is awesome, but it's not entirely him in this picture. Chris Nolan is a genius. This man has create a realistic world when everything in the screen can easily happen in real life. The shoots, the screenplay, everything is perfect. This is easily the best superhero movie of all time. The performances are OK, but here's when Ledgers steals the show. His performance is so perfect, very different from the others Jokers. This Joker is a insane man who lives of creating caos, you can see that in the scene of the Money Burning and in the end. This man, not steal, not cheat, but expends his own money to create caos. Simply brilliant. The Dark Masterpiece, like everyone says to it. Chris Nolan, we are waiting for rises.",1
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christian bale playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!",1
"Well I have finally seen The Dark Knight and it was well worth the wait. This is a movie about a character that everyone thinks that they know, however the movie blows our pre-conceptions out of the water. Now this review has no spoilers so it is safe to move on!First things first, this is NOT a feel-good movie, I did not leave the cinema on a high knowing that all is well in Gotham. If you are expecting a comic book style movie like recent Spider-Man's or Iron Man you may be disappointed. This is not cartoony, this is a world where things are really wrong and a guy dressed in a black bat suit is not going to make everything all right. Whilst the movie is a story-in-one you can see that this series is (should) be continuing on from here, where to I don't know.Gotham City is dark and unsettling and it makes you wonder why anybody not involved in crime would want to live there anyway, these people don't know what they want and everyone is in the grip of the city's depressing surroundings and out of control crime.The characters are brilliant and really make this an adults movie. Christian Bale is terrific as Bruce Wayne/The Batman and plays both roles as extreme polar opposites of each other. The suit is more realistic than ever and it's upgrades are expressed in the movie rather than Batman just appearing in a new fangled suit for no good reason other than to sell a new action figure. Hopefully Bale continues in this role for some time to come.Aaron Eckhart is superb as Harvey Dent, this is a real role, not tacked on and in fact a major story line through the entire movie. Harvey Dent is someone who you want to win the war on crime but like most everything else you watch this character with a sense of dread.Gary Oldman, fantastic, Jim Gordon is portrayed in a different way to the previous incarnations from other movies. Here is a dedicated police officer who takes us on a wave ride of highs and low's as his chases criminals and provides real depth to the role. Jim Gordon is a hero and at one point in the movie he provides the audience (at least me) with goosebumps and a slow nodding of the head in agreement.Maggie Gyllenhaal is good in a role that is really going nowhere, no fault of hers, just Rachael Dawes, even if she wanted to has no real power in this world. As a sidebar, she walks all over Katie Holmes.Finally, Heath Ledger, was he even in this movie? I saw nothing but the Joker every time he was on the screen. It takes something special for an actor to remove anything of himself from a movie and have audience believe they are watching the character, not them acting. And, what a character, this Joker is unstoppable, unremitting and unrelenting. There is a point during the movie when you realise that there is nothing anyone can do to talk him out of his behaviour, whether by negotiation or through threats, this guy literally has nothing of value at all to lose. This is the homicidal Joker that I remember from comic books that has previously never risen above pure campyness (is that a word?) you know what I mean. In closing, this is a movie that is provocative in it's story telling, brilliant in bringing it's dark world to life, and finally does not give the impression that everything is going to be all right. Check it out for yourself.",1
"Shawshank redemption is honestly one of Stephen King's best stories. Following the story of Andy Dufresne, a man charged with the murder of his wife is sent to Shawshank prison to carry out his life sentence. Andy defied any expectation of what a prisoner could or couldn't achieve and the power one could possess. With his inmate friend, Red, and his intelligence, Andy struggles to survive in prison with all his effort leading up to the grand finale.
This movie is beautiful, it's brutal and emotional and it makes you question the American penitentiary system in the 1950's. But the point is that it's a heart warming story of two inmates, talking about hope, redemption and trying to figure out their next move.
While there could only be one winner for the '94 Best Picture Awards, Shawshank deserved the title just as much as Forrest Gump so trust me when I say that you won't regret watching it.",1
"Went and saw TDK last night at midnight. And while all the build up of Heath Ledger's character did meet expectations, some other areas paled in comparison to Batman Begins. Some of the plot in this installment seemed rushed. The repetition started getting to me a little while into the film. I began noticing lots of the same elements from Batman Begins. Which, generally, isn't a bad thing. But for this movie, I was expecting something a little more fresh. In fact the only thing that seemed very fresh about TDK was The Joker's character. I believe they made a very big mistake hiring Maggie Gyllenhaal for the part of Rachel Dawes. As it pains me to say this, Katie Holmes actually played the part much better.I'm certainly going to watch this movie a few more times. Hopefully not being in a jam packed scorching hot theater may change my view on the movie. However, overall Batman Begins seemed to flow better, and wasn't congested with various different character plot points. I gave this an 8/10. Later views may bring it to a 9/10.There is one thing that remains certain, and was abundantly clear throughout the whole film. Heath Ledger did a superb job portraying The Joker. Oscar worthy? Perhaps. I wouldn't place bets quite yet on that. It's a shame he is no longer with us.Cheers.",1
"Fight club is directed by one of my favorite film directors David Fincher. The film based on the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk. I absolutely adore this film for its philosophy. It's one of those films that I happen to watch once a year. It's close to me and motivates me in my life. Let's get something off first, people whom never seen Fight Club get mistaken to what this film is all about. To those who never seen Fight Club, This is not a movie about guys pounding each other up until there is a winner. No, Fight Club is essentially about particular and Cultural Revolution inside a corporate consumer civilization that abolishes the humanoid life. The film stars, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and Jared Leto. Story:- This is a story of Tyler Durden. Edward Norton (Narrator) is a public bodily human being who subsists an uninteresting life. He spends money on everything of which he sees an advertisement; however, he realizes that nothing is worth buying. He is jaded of his dull life. On one irregular day his house was caught on fire, which therefore he was depressed on things he paid money for is now all gone. He shared his grievance with Tyler Durden to whom he has just met in an airplane. This was his greatest moment that completely changes the narrator's (Norton) life as a whole. Tyler was clever, energetic and entirety that Norton (narrator) has constantly hopes to be. Tyler was unrestricted from all kind of responsibilities. Norton (Narrator) joins forces with Tyler and starts a club known as Fight Club. Fight Club is the method to break free. It is a club where two people will fight with each other. It is a club with the certain set of rules. Members of fight club are obliged to these rules. Tyler was the guru, persuader and stimulus for the club members, they respect Tyler. This conveyed Tyler and prospect to pledge Project Mayhem. Project Mayhem was all about annihilation; it was all about economic balance. Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt is one of the greatest characters in the history of films, and Pitt has brilliantly described the character of Tyler Durden. Pitt has specified a certain style to the character which was needed. Durden was innovative and completely different from characters you'd see on screen. Most of the famous lines in this movie were said by Tyler Durden. In the film itself, he becomes a Godly figure, hence the say, In Tyler We Trust.Edward Norton is an amazing actor; he has the ability to get into the skin of the character. In this film he has plays the storyteller and story was said from his point of view. David Fincher is a great storyteller he had his ways to tell this complex story with such a chic and sophistication. This film is based off a novel; however, Fincher still put his own style in this film. The reason I say this because one of his previous film that came out four years before this Seven had same kind of style. Fincher as well put a lot in- depth detailing in the script alone and as well the characters, which is what made this film what it is. It boils down to this; Fight Club is truly an amazing film. I highly recommend it, and I also recommend the book.",1
"It would be unfair to say that it is not the best film of Christopher Nolan. The movie takes you at all times through dreams, these dreams are altered by the memories of its creator, so the movie allows us to follow several time lines simultaneously and gradually get to know the story of Cobb and Mal.",1
"its very good i am pleased to say . if you haven't seen it please proceed to do so before the end of your life cycle.this movie is unlike any super hero out there in that for one he's no power other than his gadgets, but two in that its freaking amazing. heath ledgers joker is everything the joker should be in a movie adaptation and everything we didn't see coming. not to forget about Christian bales batman which is easily one of the best portrayals of batman, ever. if thats not enough to make you want to see this movie then maybe its not for you. if its not for you then your'e not real. simple as that. This is not only one of the best superhero movies, but also one of the best movies of all time.",1
"The Movie is wonderful and the visual effects as well.
Its a good movie...",1
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor.",1
"Fight Club is by far the best movie I've ever seen. Plot is well done, characters are executed perfectly and keeps you guessing till the end. Its full of twists and memorable quotes, as well as a completely different way to look at life. I have recommended it to all my friends and they too have enjoyed it very much. Edward Norton does an excellent performance as The Narrator as well as Brad Pitt in his role of Tyler Durden. If you have read the book then you will be most pleased at the quality of the movie that director David Fincher has done for it. For those who enjoy a mind bending movie, or one that would make you say ""What no, no way"" then Fight Club is a definite choice for viewing.",1
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!",1
"A month back I thought I'd look for some good movies on IMDb again, and surprisingly saw that there was a new rookie in the Top 250 list. The shawnshank redemption. After checking that the movie plots fit my likings, I decided to give the ""ahem ahem"" version a shot. Sure I didn't expect it to beat my favorite movies, the godfather.. fight club.. terminator 2, but thought It'd be watchable as it had the titles I liked.Then came weekend, and I sat down and watched the movie. I was immediately thrilled after first 30 minutes, and later on kept hoping It'd never end. But once the end came, I sat there, eyes a bit wet, and thought WOW. This truly was the best movie I've ever seen, beating everything else in the IMDb list.Afterwards, I went and ordered the DVD (2 of 'em to cover my illegalness in the first place) and watched the extra contets as well. Truly a 1# of all time.I'm going to miss Morgan Freeman when he leaves this world.",1
"There are movies that everyone should see...like Shawshank Redemption, the Matrix...or the Lotr: Return of the King...having watched all previous Batman movies i couldn't say it for any of them...(yes even Batman:Begins) but Dark Knight has changed it.It took a superhero, who was the only serious thing in its universe and recreated that universe to fit the superhero...it began with the Begins...but i thinks it is safe to say that no one expected the change to be this swift...Christopher Nolan is a true genius for creating a Batman that everyone could like and a movie that everyone should watch.Finally i would like to add that acting on this movie was absolutely delicious...Morgan Freeman and Micheal Caine are true masters...but Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and especially Heath Leadger who ironically and unfortunately gave the performance of his life and passed away before he could get the praises he deserved was also tremendous.My only regret is not being able to give this movie an eleven out of ten...definitely a true Masterpiece",1
"I've seen this movie the day after it's release in theaters in the US. I have to say that it's one of the best movie ever. Though like many others would say that it's as good as Godfather. I can't really say since I've never seen that movie and probably never will. But the most thing that caught my attention the most is Heath Ledger's performance as the menacing Joker. I have to admit, Joker is one of my favorite comic book villains of all time, and Ledger nailed it. Sadly he's not here to see how big of a success this became, but I bet he would be appreciable about his accomplishment. Though I came to found out that Ledger was in two other movies that I really like (""10 Things I Hate About You"" and ""The Brothers Grimm""). I never knew the actor's name in both films until I realize it after seeing ""The Dark Knight"". Yeah, I felt stupid, but can't help it if I have bad memory sometimes.Though enough of Ledger's excellent work in this movie. There was other things in this movie that I really loved. Two-Face was awesome. Especially the actor, Aaron Eckhart, was really great for the role. It was like he was born to play as Two-Face (Same for Ledger as the Joker). I actually thought Two-Face would be a cliffhanger to the third movie. I guess not. It was a great ending for the movie to end it as Harvey the hero and Batman on the run from the law for the choice he made (I hope that made sense). Brilliant. Just pure brilliant.Commissioner Gordon, as always, is my favorite supporting character from the Batman comics. Gary Oldman was great for the role, and just because I never like the guy who portrayed Gordon from the Burton/Schumacher movies (Blah! He was a good actor but I didn't see him as James Gordon). And I actually thought Gordon was killed, but he came back and shows Joker who's boss.Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, sticking true to the comics perfectly and the character was explore excellently too. And Freeman is a very talented guy and did a really great job at his role.Maggie Gyllenhaal was better then Katie Holmes. I don't care what you are all complaining about, Maggie is great for the role. Just I wish Rachel's death came unexpected (Internet sucks sometimes, that's all I can say).Sir Michael Caine from my favorite movies he starred (""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"", ""Batman Begins"", and of course ""The Dark Knight"") is a great talent as well. He serves us was a really good performance of Alfred (Michael Gough is still my favorite portrayal of Alfred from the original Batman series).Last but not least, the main character, our favorite Dark Knight caped crusader, BATMAN! He's also known as Christian Bale. All I have to say about what he did for this movie is...well, what can I say? He is the Batman, he was perfect with the role from start to finish.I like to say that Heath Ledger wasn't certainly playing the Joker. He IS the Joker. I know a lot of you say that, but it's the truth.So overall the characters, actors, plot, and director did a great job. Nicely done.So hopefully I will see this movie in theaters again. It was the greatest movie experience in my life as a filmmaker, and forever will be remembered. I just wish my cousin and her boyfriend wasn't there making out. Only kidding though. I wasn't anywhere near them while watching the movie. :P I rate ""The Dark Knight"", 10 out of 10 stars!",1
"I haven't read the book, but I have seen Fincher's latest masterpiece and, rather than bore anyone with a synopsis of this mind-blowing gem, I must state emphatically, ""This is one of the best movies made in the last 10 years!""If I was stuck on a desert island, this classic would be at the top of my list.  Bravo, Mr.Fincher!",1
"I avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship, honesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in a prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such inmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He tries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and grace. This is a film that I will see again and again.",1
"Following his movies ""Momento"", ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"", and ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan delivered another masterpiece with this science fiction thriller. The entire concept of the movie was completely unique and was one of the reasons this movie succeeded. The star studded cast featuring Leonardo Decaprio, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Tom Hardy all delivered amazing performances in what may have been one of the most difficult roles of their careers. The visuals featured throughout the film were spectacular, especially one in which Decaprio and Page are walking through a city shaped like a box, where they can walk on the walls and ceiling. I have never seen such a complex scene look so good before. Many people found this movie confusing, and I'll admit this movie gets better with a second viewing, but Nolan purposely leaves the movie on a cliffhanger to make the audience think. This strategy worked perfectly as every single time I have seen this movie, I have ended up discussing the ending with others. All in all, this movie was yet another masterpiece to add to Nolan's filmography. I love movies that make you think, and this certainly did that. 9/10",1
"Sorry entire cast other than Heath Ledger. Heath blew this character out of this role. They could have called this movie The Joker. His role made me become a huge Batman fan. I already collect movies, but I went in to high gear for the different covers of the movie especially when he was on cover. I have a framed picture of him where he is standing in the street when he thinks he finally caught Batman. The poster has his and Christian Bale's facsimile autographs. I'm still searching for more different covers. Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors, but sorry Mr. Jack Nicholson Heath made you look like a novice actor! I highly recommend this movie. Has a great story, great acting, great directing, but out this world acting from Heath Ledger. He is a actor that will be missed!",1
"The first time I saw this movie I was 13 years old. I had limited ability to cogitate the dimension of the bomb that was chucked into my mind, but my intuitions recognized that this was something special. I am a 31 year old right now. I just watched the movie for a 4th time, and recognized that here is a ridiculous amount of esoteric information thrown to the viewer and with such a unique style that it is passionately invigorating. It hits a chord that wakes up your soul and stimulates you to rebel against otherwise invisible entities. How habituated are we to consumerism? How has consumerism shaped our identity? How much is consumerism debilitated us at diverse dimensions and levels? How alienated are we from our noble savage that we have turned to selfishness and malevolence?We are presented with the protagonist (Edward Norton). He sets off an identity crisis after accidentally setting fire to his apartment. In the earlier scenes of that movie we see him decorating meticulously every single object of his apartment, like the objects he owns are his identity. ""You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.""After the protagonist's commodities are gone he goes into a mental breakdown where he literally has no place where he belongs, no place to stay. Under the severe affliction he meets Tyler Durden. ""You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You are not your  khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world."" Tyler delivers a powerful philosophical dialogue that seems to be exactly what the protagonist needs to hear. Before the night is over Tyler challenges him to a fight. Now this is the critical part about the movie. The fight symbolizes the protagonist reviving his ability to fight against a monster that is habituation. Tyler says: How much do you know about yourself if you have never been in a fight? Basically what it means is if you have not fought for something you believe in to the death, how much you know about what you can accomplish. Tyler teaches him to wake up and care. Care that he has been abused by the system and consumerism to the point that he has a mental breakdown after losing his possessions. Act on the injustice, develop convictions, ideas, care, and become humane, via learning how to fight, fight for what he cares about. This is the central idea of fight club. We are going to teach you to care.The movie has deep psychological teachings about habituation. At some point of the movie Tyler sends off members of the fight club to fight random people on the street. He specifically instructed them to lose. He wanted to hit the most primal sensation in human beings when they are attempting to survive a life or death circumstance and help them believe that they can win and defeat their fears. He metaphorically attempts to face Carl Jung's shadow. A person cannot be good if he has not learned to dominate his shadow (shadow symbolizing the control the person has to participate in deliberate destruction). Tyler's philosophy aims to make his fighters develop discipline, convictions, identity, resiliency, humanity, fearlessness, and solidarity. Tyler is conducting a concerted effort to target the original and elusive culprit of the fighter's inability to be happy in society. Why are you unhappy in this society? Maybe you need some of Tyler's philosophy.Before the protagonist met Tyler he was deep in an identity crisis. He had chronic insomnia, a job that he found with lack of meaning, materialistic ideas and behaviors, lack of discipline, lack of ability to suffer, and loneliness. He was suffering navigating through the Jungian analytical process of individuation. Before he could develop and establish an identity that was resilient to consumerist bombardment he had to face his deepest fears and face his shadow. Why have we not faced our shadow? Why are we incapable of being humane? Why do we not have the collective ability to end wars? Why are we so bad at constructing healthy relationships? Why do we struggle sacrificing and suffering for others? The protagonist in the movie understood that Tyler's philosophy was going to emancipate him from his suffering and help him discover his ego and shadow, and allow him to progress to also discovering his anima, animus, and old wise man (archetypes of the collective unconscious).Anyone that wants to understand this movie and the criticism it does to materialism and consumerism is in for an entertaining, passionate, unique, and frenetic ride. The soundtrack is one of the best I've seen in any movie. The intensity of the scenes is high and the grim violence can be disturbing, but makes it up with witty comedy and a genius dialogue that achieves a deep analysis few movies have demonstrated. I personally have not read the book, but feel satisfied with this masterpiece that transcends anything that I ask of a movie.",1
"I think that if I list all the positive things, I could write a novel. This is one of the best movies ever. Very good special effects, exciting story and the most important one must not forget, namely the legendary portrayal of the Joker of Heath Ledger.",1
"A rush of mixed feelings- confusion, disappointment, anger, huff, altogether creating a decision, and the aftermath becomes regrettable! A life sentence to prison brings an innocent heart among the minds of criminals, and strict prison security. But, as time passes, the truth and the beauty unfolds. Everyone in there is innocent. Just the lawyers screwed them! Also, the friendship grew between two people, and how they turned the prison into something else, something much more beautiful than the outer world. Spending decades in there gradually becomes living in there. The struggle, the livelihood, the fun, the everyday life, turn the people Institutional! At a point it'll feel like, We belong there! Altogether, the discipline, the rules, the cold bars of cells, the lives, the dreams, the hopes, the redemption, these all just put one's whole life in front of your eyes!
Jack may have a family now. Many people have also been there, after Red. Andy can see his customers go fishing. And yes, We now know a good use of the Bible!",1
"I will make it short: it is a nice, mind-boggling move, not more not less. We have seen people chasing each other on skies in the mountains already at least once in a James Bond movie and this is also not the first movie about dreams, manipulating peoples minds etc. The case is good, sci-fi effects are state of the art, but this is it. This is not a movie I will still think of in a week from now, a similar movie that really stuck to my mind was ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", a lot less (if any) special effects, but very subtle. Still this is probably the best movie that is currently in the cinemas and it is worth seeing.",1
"Although there are some Stephen king story lines that work better as a book and not as a motion picture, Shawshank Redemption is a classic. It seems like every time Frank Darabont and Stephen King come together the outcome is phenomenal. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is accused of murdering his wife and is sentenced to Shawshank prison for two life sentences. The extremely aloof character offers a powerful performance as he adjusts to his new life behind bars meanwhile planning his very long and patient escape. Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) befriends Andy while offering an incredible narration throughout the movie.A definite must see.",1
"Nearly everyone knows the rules, number one of which I'm about to break.What do you do if you're sick of your boring, pathetic life? In the most cathartic, DIY approach possible, Fight Club answers this question: you change it. The absolute prototype of an existential thriller, it wouldn't be taking too much of a leap to suggest that Fight Club is one of the best films ever made.Jim Uhls' excellently adapted screenplay of Chuck Palahniuk's novel (this is the only major work by Uhls that I can find), this thriller has been exciting male audiences the world over since its release in 1999. Even Palahniuk himself said the film was amazing. In fact, he admitted that film was so good, the book in comparison made him feel ashamed.A nameless, pitiful, seemingly friend and family-less Office worker (Edward Norton) suffers from insomnia. True to Palahniuk's style, the solution to the insomnia comes in a bizarre way. He finds relief by attending support groups for diseases, diseases he doesn't have; these people really listen to him, and afterwards, he sleeps. At these meetings he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Character), a nemesis and lover, and it is through her that Mr. Office worker discovers his true self, but not until after he's transformed more than just his own life.Mr. Pitiful Office worker meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden helps Mr. Pitiful Office worker admit to his misery once and for all. Channeling their suppressed male aggression in its rawest form, they start fighting each other. Soon Mr. Pitiful Office worker realizes that he and Durden are not alone. Men, downtrodden, tired of their insignificance as worthless individuals all aim to do something greater. They jump at the chance to vent their primal steam, and the solo fights turn into group fights. Durden's vision eventually transcends aggression in its physical form and becomes something much greater, a community where the individual ceases to exist. As part of this whole, every unnamed member is an equal and significant contributor, and it is through the whole that the individual finds meaning. As part of the whole they are changing the future together.This movie is a directing marvel. With time shifts, psychological manipulations, and very meticulous scene planning, we are kept on the edge of our seats for the entire film. Accompanied by the pounding soundtrack composed by the Dust Brothers, Fincher achieves the rarity of making a movie better than a book. Fincher turns the concrete basement of Lou's Tavern into perhaps the most famous arena in all of modern film. The house on Paper Street, a lone abandoned mansion, becomes a factory of redefinition, of reinvention. In the final scene an amazing mesh between the visuals and the music, The Pixies' ""Where is my Mind,"" Fincher creates one of the most stunning combinations of sight and sound in all of film. And it's a pretty damn good ending to the plot too.The most memorable scene is when Durden is behind the wheel of a car full of passengers. He buckles up, pins the gas, and lets go of the wheel. The car veers off the road and crashes, flipping multiple times. We are force fed the hard truth here. The Fight Club mantra: to change to our lives we need to rid ourselves of our past failures, forget the job, the kids, the car, the living room, the flat screen HDTV, and just let go.

The best film ever made. Amazing acting no boring parts of the film. Overall astonishing,1
This movie is one of my favorites about redemption and friendship. A must see for all.,1
"There are no words to describe this film. No matter how many times I have seen it, I always want to go back for more. I can't imagine any other title claiming a top spot! The whole idea of the film was excellently executed, acted superbly and produced by the best. If anyone has not seen this film, I will worry for them.",1
"Wow is the first word that comes to mind here. What a spectacular film. Don't get me wrong, the story was fantastic, but the characters absolutely make this film. Heath Ledger pulls off a brilliant Joker. I hate to say it, but he makes Jack Nicholson look terrible. He literally puts him to shame with his performance. His character actually leaves you feeling irked and well....weird. I was blown away at how well he became the Joker. Once again, however, the rest of the cast did a phenomenal job. Christian Bale, in my eyes, is the best Batman to don the mask and cape. This movie, though long, kept me on the edge of my seat the entire film. I never felt, at any point, that I was bored. It had a brilliant flow of drama, humor, action, etc. The witty humor leaves you laughing quite hard at times. It's an absolute masterpiece. If you have not seen the film quite yet, do so as soon as you get a chance. You won't be disappointed.",1
"At first, the theme of this movie 'dreams' is interesting. I guess that Christopher Nolan must be a geek obviously because I hardly ever watch such an exciting movie what the setting and gimmicks were built superbly like this. Or rather, I wonder if he is a deviant person.I was shocked in the scene of the training that Cobb altered the structure of a city in order to show Ariadome the rules in the dreams. I think that many people were fascinated in this scene.
But my most favorite scene is the sequence of the elevator.",1
"Shawshank Redemption takes place in the jail named Shawshank,everything begins with a banker named Andy that is accused of murder, when he gets into jail he meets Redd(Morgan Freeman)that later on becomes his friend,while they are in jail Andy discover valuable details about the case that get him to jail. The movie was release in 1994 and it take place on the years 1940-1960,the director is Frank Darabond. The plot of the movie make me keep my interest on it. The way they manage to tell the situations in a chronological order and make the situations be related one to another making it find a way to solve it. The very last part make me stand on the edge of the seat even though the ending is expected and its obviously that some things will happen make you get anxious because of it. I recommend it,maybe nowadays is a little old but is a great movie,it keep you interested,it make you realize some things that happen in real life and you begin to think and see with ""other eyes""",1
"Inception,let us take a leap of faith.Well,People have already taken a leap of faith in Christopher Nolan since the beginning of his era stretching from Memento to The Dark Knight.But this is different.You delve into dreams and then hang on between worlds of realism or just a dream.Christopher Nolan has the absolute best ideas of all the movie writers.Apart from his directing,which is exemplary,the writing script stands out.Just the concept and to make us believe it is possible is just truly remarkable.The casting starting from Leonardo was brilliant.His acts are always regarded as superb.And Mr Cobb in Inception is at the top for me.Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Ellen Page are great too.Ken Watanabe is a fabulous man to have in your movie as he justifies each and every role given to him.He is a great actor.So is Cillian Murphy for his role.Just so calm and compose in this act where as his previous movie roles were being aggressive and cunning.He is a diversified actor.I don't want to forget Marion Cotillard after her role of Mal and just to have Tom Berenger in the movie is an honor.The movie draws attention on basic idea extraction from dreams.A vision appears to the audiences as Cobb & crew delve into numerous dreams.When we see gravity shifts and Limbo drops audiences will always get a kick of their own that Christopher Nolan is brilliant.Camera-work is sensational,Directing is again superb,Screenplay is everlasting.And music by Hans Zimmer is as perfect as a Dream Creation itself.The conclusion for this movie stands out as one of the rarest & visionary movies to have come along.Justifies its #4th position in the top 250.This is not great,this is just grand.Vision is for the Oscars,Dreams are for the audiences and Nolan is just Nolan.Simply Brilliant.People might think now,after such successes of movies from Nolan.Can't we call Perfect as the new adjective,that we know now,none other than Nolan.",1
"First, I would like to say that the many many negative reviews are correct in that, yes this movie is complex, multi-layered, thought-provoking, open to interpretation, and it requires suspension of disbelief. However, by the end of the movie, you will understand it, and it will make more sense. It is also not intelligent, but rather clever. And it all makes for one great movie. I mention the negative reviews, because they kept me from watching it until recently. I was highly intrigued by the idea, so I had to watch it anyway. I was not disappointed.Now, for the more intelligent among you, you may figure it out before the end, like I did. But, then I almost always do that. And, actually the ending was not quite what I thought it would be, it was similar, but better (if that's possible) ! This is a movie that must be watched at least once, trust me.I don't want to give away any spoilers, there's already plenty of those around here, so that is all I will say.9/10, mostly because the acting could have been a bit better, and they could have explained things a bit more clearly. I didn't understand what was going on until more than half-way through. It's more like 9.5/10.",1
"I saw this quite a long time ago and i think it was exceptionally brilliant. We think a movie can have certain limitations on its effect and direction but this movie shows you how awesome and well-directed a movie can be. This movie is about male aggression, not just aggression, it is a wrong word, it shows how much non-alive we are. So a guy starts fight club to have some sort of aliveness in a person. He is a visionary man, tyler durden, who has a plan and an entirely different approach to the modern generation. What follows is a roller coaster ride and a one which you wont possibly forgot till you die.The acting is brilliant and so are the one liners.Even before the ending you are tightly gripped by this movie and i assure you at the end you will be overly surprised. According to me this has one of the most unexpected endings and a moral message i have seen in a movie. You have to watch this 10/10",1
"An always-tense, extremely suspenseful sci-fi action film that respects a viewer's intelligence.One of the best things about Nolan is that he writes his own material. He is in total control of the story. He isn't interpreting someone else's vision, he's translating his own thoughts to the screen.
Nolan is so eager to make the movie work as an action blockbuster that he sacrifices storytelling to set pieces. Still, what set pieces",1
"Tonight I celebrate my love for you It seems the natural thing to do Tonight no one's gonna find us We'll leave the world behind us When I make love to youTonight I celebrate my love for you And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too Tonight, our spirits will be climbing To a sky filled up with diamonds When I make love to you tonightTonight I celebrate my love for you And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through Tonight there'll be no distance between us What I want most to do is to get close to you tonightTonight I celebrate my love for you And soon this old world will seem brand new Tonight we will both discover How friends turn into lovers When I make love to youTonight I celebrate my love for you And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through Tonight there'll be no distance between us What I want most to do is to get close to youTonight I celebrate my love for you Tonight",1
"One of the greatest films ever made. It is not by accident that Stephen King agreed with this adaption of his work because Mr. Darabont did the work justice. From script adaption, to the casting, to the overall aesthetic, this film is truly a masterpiece. Not only does Morgan Freeman find rare form with his performance while making this work, but Tim Robbins showed his unique styling as well. This is simply a work of brilliance, and I can only hope that films like this will continue to be created for the world to enjoy. Kudos to the creative team, and all of those who put so much work into making The Shawshank Redemption. I will always have a special place in my heart for this film.",1
Best movie ever from DC thear are relasing new movies but i can't compare any of them with this hope soon we will see a movie in this level from dc,1
"I loved the idea of the movie, I loved the pictures, I loved the setting, so there is only one question left: What made this not one of my favorite movies.Well, first of all the story is pretty long. A movie can be as long as it needs to be, but it better keep me busy all the time. But since the images where so great and interesting, I was never tired to go on watching. I do however have a little problem while following the whole plot. Why isn't my feeling not as amazing, as it should be when presented by this visual masterpiece. I think the story behind is not as good as the visual presentation. When I remember movies like Fight Club, not only I enjoyed the visual presentation, I enjoyed the music and the narration. Combine these three wisely, and I'm happy, but Inception lacks something here.I have one example of a scene I would never forget. We do have an architect in the dream world, who is able to amend the setting like we are, when we are in a lucid dream. For all who have had a lucid dream before, if in a fight, do you summon an AK? Maybe so, but I can't help expecting more magic from the architect, but that's maybe just me.",1
"I cannot say enough good about this movie. There are so many excellent forces that made this movie that superb piece of art that it is. First, of course, is Nolan's direction. There is some seriously enlightened direction going on here. It starts off a bit slow (as most of his movies do), but he shortly throws it into overdrive. Before long, the movie is roaring past you. It's exhilarating, simply put.Nolan's writing is also top notch. The dialogue is refreshingly real, sharp, and coherent. In the beginning, viewers might find themselves a bit lost (don't worry, it's intentional), but Nolan slowly exposes INCEPTION's secrets. The plot direction carries this movie from being a simple heist movie (in the same vein as, say, OCEAN'S 11) to an emotional, thoughtful, intelligent, and utterly astounding thriller. If Nolan doesn't receive a directing or writing Oscar for this movie, then there is something seriously wrong the Academy.Also worth mentioning are the visual effects and stunts. The VFX are seamless. Even in the film's most visually intense moments, it's not entirely evident that Nolan is using CGI. Of particular mention is a fight scene that takes place in a unstable-gravity hotel hallway. As the actors twist and writhe all over a room where gravity is in flux, the viewer is left dumbfounded by the surprising realism of the scene. There's no other way to say this: INCEPTION looks great.Finally, we come to the acting. If anything could steal the spotlight from Nolan's directing and writing, it would certainly be the efforts put forth by the cast. Overall, the cast has impeccable chemistry. Everyone plays together so well. - Of course, Leonardo Dicaprio was solid. The role isn't much of a deviation for him, but he plays it well. His most emotionally intense moments hit hard and his character is developed very well. He deftly leads a relatively-unknown, but unbelievably-talented cast. There isn't that much ""star power"" in this movie, but the caliber of the acting is superb. - Marillon Cotillard was unbelievable. Her role is arguably the film's most versatile and she expertly glides through each aspect of her character. She's a very talented actress who works so well with Dicaprio. Their relationship is one of the emotional high-points of the movie and that is thanks entirely to each actors' powerful contributions to the heartbreaking reality of the relationship. - Ellen Page did a great job in her supporting role, bringing some of her signature wit into it. She has a very big on screen presence and she fits in surprisingly well with the mostly-male main cast. - Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy stole the show, in my opinion. They each play two very well-crafted characters extremely well. Levitt plays a resourceful, no-nonsense point man that wonderfully counters Dicaprio's somewhat-unstable character. Hardy plays a charismatic thief that goes from devious trickster to full-blown action hero. These guys have some seriously impressive acting chops and it was truly a delight to watch their performances. - Cillian Murphy, like Dicaprio, is mostly sticking to a role that he knows, which is not a bad thing. Murphy is a talented actor, which is readily apparent in his last big scene in the movie (one of the movie's most emotional moments). - Ken Watanabe and Dileep Rao also add a lot to the overall chemistry of the ensemble. Their presence, though not as major as some of the other characters, definitely help solidify the ensemble's power.INCEPTION will stand the test of time as one of the great American films. Nolan is a superb director and cunning writer who has assembled an elite group of actors to create a visually stunning, thrilling adventure. You'd be crazy to not want to go along for the ride.",1
"This movie will keep you glued to the TV from the first moment. Perfectly engineered film, well acted and the score is beautiful. I heavily recommend it.",1
"Wow, I thought this would just be some bad sci fci cheesy story. Nope, amazing acting, storyline, and there are no loopholes. The ending is very good and the story makes sense and is very Captivating.",1
"Back in the 7th grade, a creative writing teacher repeatedly told the entire class that in storytelling, never ever ever ever ever end the story with ""it was all a dream."" The best example she gave us was the television show Dallas, which was ultimately killed ratings-wise after pulling the feat. That being said, it was very hard to not think about this rule of thumb when Inception starts. Inception is a crazy mind-bending, heart-pounding, and spine-tingling thriller that boggles the mind, tests your willpower, and keeps you one step behind. Keeping up is an impossibility, the images presented are some of the craziest in recent memory, and the overall experience was a very tense trip.This was the cleverest sci-fi flick since the severely underrated Minority Report years ago. There is one major difference between the nearly-flawless Minority Report and the oh-so-close-to-flawless Inception: the subplot. While both movies have their main characters trying to relinquish past personal demons, Minority Report molds it into the main storyline without issue; whereas Inception's subplot deters away from the fun and mayhem of the main conflict. My interest level was waning on the subplot, while remaining at the maximum during the heist. Despite that setback, Inception is a sinister movie that is worthy of a couple viewings.Inception is an original script by Christopher Nolan, who has proved many times before he can deliver in the screen writing department. It concerns a fugitive from the United States (Leonardo DiCaprio) that specializes in stealing ideas from people's dreams. He assembles a crew for his toughest mission yet, instead of stealing ideas, actually implementing one into the mind of a person. This plot description is very basic, because part of the mystique and fun of Inception is engaging yourself in the trip of a storyline as it goes through different twists and turns. The dialogue is strong, the story is intense and deep, and the rules about dreams and how to survive in them are well-implemented.Just like in The Matrix and Minority Report, Inception's rules about the universe the characters are engaged in are all established and explained quickly in the first act. In a nice move, the deeper and more confusing of the rules are explained as the movie progresses further; in a much more successful manner than the elongated conversations in the Matrix trilogy (especially the second installment). And, just like in the two examples, the visuals strongly compliment the story and all its rules. Inception is easily one of the most visually striking and impressive movies of the 21st century, by far surpassing that of Avatar. Cities are built and destroyed, a hotel loses all evidence of gravity and physics, and entire buildings crumble like Legos. The best part of this movie is easily all the chaos that you get to see. I strongly admire Nolan's attempts to use the least amount of CGI possible. And in this movie (just like The Dark Knight_his previous movie), the lack of CGI helps the overall look.The cast of actors and actresses definitely help the movie as well. That being said, only DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard have to truly flex the acting muscles, while the rest of the cast adds style, sass, humor, and realism to the experience. Directing them with precision and attention to detail is the screenwriter himself Christopher Nolan. He directs this far better than his Batman movies, and delivers his best directing work since the underrated Insomnia. He handles his shots carefully, and does a great job engulfing the viewers in beautiful scenery. And the hotel sequence is one of the most unique action sequences ever composed. It left the audience silently begging for more.So what could possibly be wrong with the movie? Great production value, great script, deep material, grand action sequences, good acting, and let's not forget the strong musical score of Hans Zimmer. The issue comes with the pacing and the editing of the movie. The first quarter of Inception runs rather slow and lacks that first excellent suspenseful piece that was in The Matrix and Minority Report (The opening encounter with Agent Smith and the first arrest scene, respectively). Then there is one of the subplots, which while it is important to the storyline, really drags down and breaks the pacing of Inception. The main character's conflict wasn't fleshed-out very well, nor was it that interesting. It's similar to The Matrix's totally unnecessary romantic sequences---necessary to plot, but highly inferior to the rest of the movie.Bottom Line: Removing the essential but rather bland subplot involving our main character, Inception is a purely majestic sci-fi flick that will boggle the mind, test your imagination, and satisfy your craving for something original to watch in the summer. The entire production value was excellent, from the musical score to the directing to the cinematography. I keep mentioning The Matrix and Minority Report because those two movies were the last two times a science fiction movie absolutely blew me away_before this one of course. Inception will entertain, confuse, and mentally defeat you (in the first viewing at least), but it's just a few knots below the two examples in terms of overall quality.Don't let that bring you down though, because Inception must be watched on the big screen in the best quality screen imaginable. Without the usual heavy use of CGI, Inception brings you into a crazy imaginative world where despite a variety of rules, nearly anything is possible. Watch this with an open mind and mental preparation for visual and content insanity. Recommend but with a fair warning: this is not for the mindless.P.S. I love the final shot of the movie, even if I did groan a bit. And you will too.",1
"""How many nihilists does it take to change a light-bulb?"" ""-Half."" (Gettit?) Fight Club(1999) is a highly stylised hybrid--a pitch-black comedy that's hard to like unless you're male, and (possibly) clawing your way BACK from the edge of abyss.It opens with a CGI-fly-past of firing neurons under the credits, suggesting what follows is caused by misfires in the protagonist's brain. But you miss that at first for all the uncharted territory.James Uhls' impressive screen adaptation continues Chuck Palahniuk's novel attempts to revolutionize men's views of their place in first-world-societies where caveman sensibilities are literally no longer required.Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) characterizes our generation in one of his early Fight Club welcome speeches: ""We're the middle children of history--we have no Great War"", meaning that men raised without brutality still crave it--and why so many of them eagerly join up. But Club(1999) delineates its message for just one gender, never pretending to speak for women: the narrator observes that before becoming yuppies, ""we used to read pornography"": young girls were never so inclined.Nevertheless, it's frightening how many people the film appeals to. Fans over-enthuse, saying ""this is the BEST movie EVER"". Professional critics aren't so impressed. One courageous video & DVD guide claims that ""...this appalling, grotesque, and interminable endurance-test is fairytale fiction for serial killers, imbeciles who succumb to road rage, and frustrated white guys--all the morons who seek excuses for their increasingly bad behavior and hair-trigger tempers"".This temper-thing in the psych business is called ""sham-rage"" (or ""decortication"" after the severing of the neocortex in 1948 experiments on pussycats)- www.emotion.caltech.edu/courses/ss140/April17-1.pdf. The ""misfire"" in Jack's brain depicts such a neurochemical break.But maybe Jack(Ed Norton) and Tyler(Brad Pitt) have a point. To me, the movie is saying that ""frustrated"" guys are really no good for women, because, frankly, they just don't want what women have to give. Such men might now want to bond only with each other, to satisfy ancient caveman instincts, which civilisation--and women--are trying to breed out of them.That's why Jack & Tyler's fight clubs quickly evolve into organised anarchism, and eventually nihilism--the wish to destroy all moral and social edifices: males are getting back to their roots.Having ""said"" that, Fight Club(1999) tries to throw a lifeline to the seriously disaffected; but that lifeline falls on deaf ears. (*****Spoiler: The ending depicts Jack's retaking control from his ""teacher"" by redefining his personal limits regarding violence. The protagonist successfully battles his delusion to finally regain himself. He has learnt better.*****) The ""nasty"" existentialism of anarchism/nihilism still tends to appeal to young men, despite its dead-end logic. A recent email asked me whether I thought this ""philosophy of unreason"" was a mental deficiency or a choice. I call it a deficiency, as Fight Club(1999) does; the question is only how permanent that is. It can be considered foolishness--which is unlearnable; or sociopathy--which isn't.It's nice to know even its proponents (like my email friend) think this ""unreason"" is subject to cognitive override--choice--but why would anyone choose it unless their unreason validates some physiological syndrome? Anti-establishment anarchism was last big in the 19thC, having FIRST given rise to Machiavelli. During both periods it was a might-makes-right power struggle against ruling elites. We now think of these periods as callous, brutal and primitive, certainly not part of civilisation today. We expect ""civilians"" to abide by higher universal standards of humanism. Clearly, blowing up buildings and bashing each other half to death is antithetical to that social contract.However, I do like the film's position that male bonding, with/without a sexual component, might be just what they need. During a bonding session with Tyler, as they consider Jack's heterosexual relationship, Jack admits, ""I can't get married; I'm a 30yr-old boy""--to which Tyler adds, ""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we need"".This is gender politics; and Norton goes to great lengths on the commentary track to explain Jack's mistreatment of Marla (Helena Bonham-Carter) as symptomatic of Jack's social and mental incompetence. Misogyny itself, the male hatred of women, may be physiologically inspired in such boy-men struggling to behave civilly. Ancient reptilian brain-structures produce the primal urge to violence (ie just to feel alive), so fight-club violence might not be caused by ""social malaise"" at all.I suspect this is the movie's--and novel's--most unpalatable basis, making Fight Club(1999) seem ""irresponsible"" to its critics.We usually call reptilian brain-structures ""primitive"" because except in lizards (hence ""lizard-logic""), they're buried deep in the brain, overlain by ""higher"", mammalian brain-structures. Lifelong learning encapsulated in the neocortex of, say, pussycats, inhibits/overrides this reptilian dominance, but in some (""decorticated"" pussycats or people) the process may be faulty, or just take too long. However if graduating beyond such lizard-logic (anarchist idiocy) takes ""fight-clubbers"" most of their lifetime, then so be it--until then, such men are welcome to have s*x with each other.Fight Club(1999)'s main problem is that it stirs up the powerful philosophical issue of anarchism/nihilism, but leaves it unresolved, notably with its ending. The entire closing scene, including the bombing, is visually nebulous. Did all that happen, or was it just Jack's imagination? Comprehension is deliberately muddied by Jack's speedy recovery(!) from a fatal gunshot wound. Like many, I laughed at its absurdity.Yet the film's showmanship still wins new converts. It seems to set the benchmark for neocinema by demanding freeze-frame plus several viewings to build its enjoyment. Like Sixth Sense(1999), Club(1999) employs perception-shift for the lead character, but here it's integrated linearly to unfold the story.

"What makes this film is not the story, which is mysterious and compelling, but the cast that was put together to make it happen.Leonardo DiCaprio (Blood Diamond, The Aviator) is magnificent, but he doesn't carry the film on his own. He has an excellent cast supporting him: Ellen Page (Juno), Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy (Red Eye), Marion Cotillard (La Vie en Rose), and Pete Postlethwaite in one of his last roles.It is a really heavy film, with unobstructed attention compelled. But, you are rewarded with some great action sequences and special effects.Thrilling to the very end.",1

"Fantastic! The negative press it was given was undeserved. Most people didn't realize it's theme wasn't ""Men love to destroy and maim"". It was about modern man's inability to distinguish himself from the global market. It was about the loss of individuality to consumerism and assimilation. And it's about the fight to revive basic, primal emotions long buried. Perhaps the mirror was a little too clear for most of America.",1

"The greatest movie of the last decade. The movie contains more suspense than any other comic based movie. The cast is great. Outstanding actors . The performance of Heath ledger is enough for describing the brilliance of the movie. Christopher Nolan gives a dark, simple and exquisite thriller. It has a very great ratio of emotion, sadness, suspense, heroism, darkness and thrill. The music of the movie is outstanding . Christian bale gives the greatest leading performance of his career . Wally did a great job. I have seen very few movies which are so much emotional and thrilling . I liked it a lot. The movie did not lack anything . It was a magical movie and I was very much thrilled to see it .Mind blowing movie, a movie which is perhaps better than most of the movies. One of the greatest action movies of all time. I can easily say that it was the best DC comic movie ever made . I am totally blown away. "" Best of the best "". Everyone should watch it.",1
"I love this movie. It's not for everyone though. Most people turn away after just glancing the title, believing this to be some sort of 'Rocky' movie which it most certainly is not. This is a subversive commentary about modern-day problems.Consider the fact that SOME of the people on this planet are less-than-satisfied with their 9-5 clockwatching office-cubicle nuclear family type lives. Consider the fact that not everyone who appears to be insane is insane or perhaps that the ""sane"" people are all out of their minds. Consider the fact that although commercialism controls our minds perhaps not everyone is all that thrilled with that. Or let me put it another way... if you are the kind of person who finds they'd like to put a brick through the window of your local Starbucks for some ""unknown"" reason... well then, this is the movie for you! If not, then please go hole up with a 'nice' Julia Roberts or Tommy Lee Jones flick and leave the rest of us alone!This movie has the power to enlighten minds and shatter paradigms. The editing is amazing. The special FX are phenomenal. The camerawork and color is stunning and the scripting and dialog is great! (The book is equally amazing and the film, for the most part, stays true to the original.) The Dust Brothers also produced a simply amazing soundtrack for this film.Not only that, this movie is darkly humorous...as well as extremely violent, but, as i said this movie is NOT for everyone. If you don't get it... well thats too bad. I love it and the ending always makes me cry... hearing the Pixies (from Massachusetts, like me) playing at the end just makes me weep tears of joy that someone would make a movie like this for all of us corporate slaves.Thank you, David Fincher!",1

"The Dark Knight is in, my opinion ,the greatest superhero film ever made and one of the best movies in film history.This film has more than the fan boys and fan girls asked for,it also has the makings of an excellent movie from an action point of view ,a critic view and of course a blockbuster view. It is the movie that solidified the superheroes period of cinema ,in which we live. I believe that it will became one of these movies that you have to see before you die, like the Godfather ,Lorens of Arabia ,Ben Hur, Saving Prinate Ryan,Schinder's list and so on, if it is not already. To conclude, if you are alive and you love films and superheroes ,like myself, then go see it ,right now",1
"Running longish at over 2 hours Christopher Nolan has his work cut out to engage his audience - indeed, keep them on the edge of their seats - for the bulk of that time. Largely he succeeds in this difficult task.The premise, while completely improbable, is interesting, albeit in a mind-bending sort of way: a group of guys (and ultimately a girl) who are essentially con men are led by Leonardo DiCaprio to work their cons in the dreamscape of unwitting marks, convincing the dreamer to give up secret information to corporate competitors eager to pay for it. How exactly they manage to do this is never articulated, but a black box with various throbbing pumps and tubes running out of it that connects the dreamers together is the apparent answer. This is where your heavy duty suspension of disbelief has to begin with ""Inception"" or else on a mundane level the entire movie would appear to be rather silly.With that for context, ""Inception"" works because this kind of subconscious manipulation is not only possible but apparently routine with heavily sedated individuals around the globe who spend much of their lives sleeping and dreaming. DiCaprio and his team of ne'er-do-well Morpheuses travel around this surreal world, cashing in by creating scenarios in the dreamscape that are carefully constructed to pull information from the participants they've scammed into the dream world partially of their making but primarily the making of the dreamer.I won't lay out the intricacies of the plot - it's far more interesting to follow it yourself and not spoil it - but the movie builds to a point where an extremely involved web of events has to occur to create a scenario for ""inception"" - the very challenging endeavor to seed an original idea into the mind of a dreamer that was not generated by the dreamer themselves. If they succeed in this task a shadowy Japanese corporate titan - played by Ken Watanabe - who has employed them will provide a big payday and pull strings to give DiCaprio's character the ability to come back home where he is currently a fugitive from for reasons that reveal themselves in those plot intricacies.This sets up the climax of the movie: A long series of dreams and dreams-within-a-dream (ultimately 4 levels of dreams within a dream) to create a wild series of events all setup to convince the dreamer/mark to think a particular original thought that was seeded by the ""dream team"" (literally). Make sense? Probably not, but see the movie and it will come together.If there is a fault with this climax it is that while it exists as what is supposed to be a set piece for the suspenseful build-up of the entire movie, it falters in maintaining its high-wire act. Certainly not entirely, but at least partially it begins to drag and feels somewhat tedious. The earnestness of the climax creates a kind of self-consciousness about how awesome and mind-blowing it's all supposed to be. We end up with scenes in this climactic denouement that go longish to explicate the reasons why some things are the way they are and the explanations feel drawn-out. Not sure about others, but this failed to build the suspense of the final scenes for me. It felt like we were getting setup with information that should have been revealed earlier so they wouldn't have to insert longish digressions into the final climax.""Inception"" reminded me quite a lot of ""The Matrix"" in the sense that it introduces you to the concept of a parallel universe that is set for a whole series of wild adventures. Beyond that the similarities probably end as I think ""The Matrix"" succeeded far more in presenting this parallel world and also in maintaining the suspense and action throughout.Still, ""Inception"" is by no means bad. With Nolan involved that's nearly impossible. It is in many ways masterfully built to establish credibility for the ideas it presents. I don't expect to have my specific expectations catered to - in fact, I hoped that Nolan would create a movie that would completely upset them - but the process to create an involving story built around those improbable ideas is incredibly challenging. He succeeds mostly, but stretches too long to make the idea credible and makes the action and suspense slog in the process.Interestingly there was actually not nearly as much CGI as the trailers would lead you to believe. When it is used it is used to manipulate the ""real world"" in a way that makes you realize ""hey this is a dream"" but otherwise it isn't like a Salvador Dali painting come to life or anything that extreme. If anything Nolan did an exceptional job of not stretching the film into the realm of clichéd surrealism. ""Inception"" portrays the dream world as a concrete place that can be manipulated with some degree of precision, as a place that can be gamed and milked for advantage.Enjoy this for its plot intricacies, which are extremely well composed, and you may ultimately find it more suspenseful than I did.",1
"Life in ShawShank Prison coalesces criminality, corruption, death, truth, god and hope into a wonderful film starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Set in the 1940's, Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life is altered forever when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Shawshank demonstrates how quickly and naively the criminal justice system can wrongly convict a man and alter his destiny forever. Lady justice clearly is incapable of knowing all things and rendering perfect judgment.An innocent man at heart, Andy, with the help of his friend Red, showcase the life of prisoners and put on full display internal prison dynamics, the effects of lengthy prison sentences on the soul, the process of rehabilitation, and the will to survive with hope to live and fight another day. Following his conviction, Andy is tortured by a small immoral gang of rapists until the warden places him in his protective womb. In exchange for his services and help with financial matters Andy's stature grows and his influence spreads. A friendly relationship develops over the years, with Andy eventually processing tax returns, and subsequently running a fraudulent scheme for the warden. Surprise twists find its way in the form of a truth telling inmate overhearing the real killer of Andy's wife. Warden Norton wants no part in this, fearing for his operations and control of the institution. Quickly he pours ice on the idea, and subjugates Andy to physical torment to bend his will.Ever the precocious young lad, Andy secretly plots for over 20 years and reveals an astounding and ingenious strike to send Warden Norton into a suicidal finale.Shawshank is a classic, darker than The Green Mile, yet truthfully a reflection of how the system can go so very wrong. Sometimes, truth and justice are not good enough, and one must rely on himself to adequately realign the scales.",1

"... since Tim Burton's ""Batman"". No argument here, both movies are masterpieces, and this movie is in a different vein, so, comparisons are unfair to both sides. With that said, on to the review of Chris Nolan's ""Dark Knight"".The only problems I found in this movie are: it's a little pretentious for just being the story of a guy with a bat-suit, and the dialog has some silly stuff here and there... but that's just minor nitpicking, compared with the engaging and emotionally exhausting experience this movie is. This movie is one of those who puts you in the edge of your seat the whole time. The performances are excellent in general, but Ledger's Joker, is brilliant, one of the most frightening characters in the history of cinema. The story has ups, downs, adventure, comedy, drama, tragedy, redemption, sadness... it's incredible. It's like riding in a roller coaster, but with the Joker seated next to you: Funny and frightening. That sums up the movie. Perfect score for this thrilling ride to Mr. Nolan.10/10",1
"this aim of this review is to complete your viewing of Inception by clarifying 95% of the confusion people get from the plot. Reading this on the faq section tied all the lose ends in the film for me.***spoiler*** Each level is dreamt by a different member of Cobb's team, and then Fisher's subconscious is brought in to fill it. The first level is dreamed by Yusuf, who then stays behind to drive the van and initiate a kick to bring them back. The second level is dreamt by Arthur, who then stays behind to put them in the elevator and initiate another kick. The third level is dreamed by Eams, who again stays behind to plant explosives on the building, which drops them and initiates another Kick. The final level is Limbo. Limbo is a shared environment not limited to a single subconscious. Limbo contains nothing, excep the remnants of whatever might have been built by someone who has been there before. Cobb has been there before, so limbo contains the buildings he and his wife built over the 50 years they spent there. ********* the movie explained Limbo very briefly and quickly, so reading this certainly helped me understand the final parts of this film.",1

"I came expecting an anarchist fighting movie.  What I got was so much more. The pacing is a bit off though.  Parts of the movie DRAG.

"I wanted to rate this a 10 but seriously I rated Good-fellas a 9. So I am not even sure why people rated this so high. I mean 9 is about right but at 9.3 that would mean a bunch of people gave it a 10. Seriously we are talking about the godfather and plenty of other great movies. Gladiator and so on. And its a 5 star movies (as I would like to say basing it off the hotel rankings). but 10, OK.Normally I click the spoiler alert on her just because right over it says black list and frankly when I hear the phrase ""blacklisted"" i think of Al Capone, so no thanks on that part. Which leads us right into the character Andy. He was accused of killing his wife and her lover. Plus the scene was set in the late 40's. Perfect time to set a script. I love the classic cars. You don't get people saying ""that would never happen"" most people weren't even alive then. Along as they aren't talking on their cell phone in the movie, then most of the time people just watch. Andy gets falsely accused mostly to his cold demeanor in the court room. Its 2017 and I watch Snapped, forensic files and I was a avid court TV watcher before they changed, and if you go to court in the fashion he did with a judge deciding your fate (i didn't see the jury read the verdict on that one maybe i missed that part) you are definitely not going to get any sympathy from the court. Which in his case and now you need all the sympathy you can get. He does all the taxes and even money laundering for the warden when he eventually plots and escapes prison only to get that money out of an account and then go on to live life on a beach. Why let another person steal your credit for hard work when you can get credit for your own work. I wouldn't suggest breaking out of prison to do it (that would be a felony) but high stakes high rewards, right?Also with Andy's character. He made you feel different and you wanted to watch him. He was not predictable. When turned up that music in the wardens office I was like ""wow that took some guts to do."" And also about the guys who kept torturing him and raping him, that made you feel different about things. This was a person who was struggling. And you wanted to see how it ended. What makes this film great is its dark and it brings you into the movie. Books have a lot more time and lot of ways to get you into the book with words than movies can do with video. Words lead to imagination and simply can give you a very vivid image. Video is what you see and what you get. Hard to duplicate a book so the best you can do is be dark about about describe people the best you can do in a 2 hour time block. Sounds easy but its not. When you watch this movie you feel like you are in prison. They don't waste time talking about the food in prison. We got it, I am sure the food isn't exactly like a restaurant in the Hampton. They spent most of their time explaining Andy.This is another story about a person who didn't fit in with what society has labeled him and he told people the truth and they didn't believe him. So he figured another way to bring the people who held him captive while fixing his own life. It didn't happen over night. He didn't just take what life gave him, he took what life gave him and used it against them and kept a memory of it and wrote everything down. My favorite part is when Tim ribbons is talking to Morgan freeman saying "" i had to come prison to learn to be a criminal."". I got chills from hearing that. Cause that is the truth. A smart banker mixed with criminals is very dangerous. They know all the laws, the loop holes and they have the patience and confidence to do it. I wouldn't rank this movie higher than the godfather like a lot of people have it on here. But its ranked as a 5 star movie to movie. Which puts it in the category of the godfather, casino, Good-fellas, Brave-heart, and the Gladiator. Then again this film is unique, the prison guards beat the lights out of people after the light are out.",1
The editing and cinematography is pushing the story line very well. The casts are delivering the message while drawing you into their world. You can easily crave to watch this movie repeatedly. The special effect is brilliant and on point. And once again Hans Zimmer is delivering an emotionally enhancing soundtrack. Definetely worth your money to spend time with your family. It is suitable for all age groups.,1
"If ""Batman Begins"" is considered a hit, then the sequel ""The Dark Knight"" is a homerun. Christopher Nolan directed a film that is hard to take your eyes away from. The opening scene of The Joker successfully scheming up a bank heist sets up the audience for the entire film. This is the beginning of many ingenious plans The Joker sets out to accomplish through the corrupt city of Gotham. But the Joker's intelligence can only last for so long with the new and improved Batman following his every step.The tremendous acting throughout the film is a catalysts to this films success. Heath Ledger is to be credited with The Joker's popularity and this film's ability to break billboards. The crazy, insane and sharp witted personality the original films and comics portrayed The Joker as, is presented so accurately in ""The Dark Knight"" it's almost scary. But one actor can't carry the entire film on his or her back. Christian bale out did himself once again as Batman, being able to not only display the constant action life of Batman but as well as act like the snobby rich Bruce Wayne every lady loves is pretty incredible. The supporting cast can't go unnoticed; Morgan Freeman (as always keeps him mellowness), Gary Oldman (gets more time to shine) and Aaron Eckhart (two faced freak).Unlike ""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight"" is much more action packed. Explosions and guns seem to appear in every Batman scene. Batman isn't the beginner he once was, his new gear makes him almost unbeatable. Giving all thanks to his right hand man, Lucius fox (Morgan Freeman). Lucius towards the beginning but more focused during end of the film, creates a functional device that detects people and their nearbies through sonar. The special effects are noticeable all over the place, whether its within the costumes or the explosions, Christopher Nolan did a nice job incorporating more futuristic weapons and ideas into the film.The only piece of the film that kept me from giving this film a 10/10 is the plot. It was very complex and not easy for many viewers to follow. Never once did I feel 100% certain on what is happening exactly for the story line. The plot revolves around mob ties, money and the court system. For example Batman at the start of film Batman travels to Hong Kong in order capture a high-end mobster, the viewers don't have much relocation of who this dude is but it happens to be to cucial the plot. Couple of characters were prevalent to the film but the viewers, who aren't hardcore Batman enthusiasts, were not given much background information about their contribution towards the story. Seems that the script went a little overboard with the complexity.After the seemed short 152 min I conclude that for the first time, the villain is my favorite character in a superhero movie. I believe many other viewers will think/say the same thing. No discredit to Batman or Christian Bail, but the inconsistent script just led to The Joker being the fan favorite. Overall ""The Dark Knight"" exceeded the expectations I came into with, DC created a new reputation of itself. Viewers will be eager to watch the future Batman films, since Gotham is and will always be messed up.",1
"Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010) is back in cinemas ahead of the release of ""Tenet"", and for its 10th anniversary.It's amazing that Inception is 10 years old. Have I been dreaming? Has time slowed down? As this classic came out before I started One Mann's Movies, a review of this tenth anniversary showing seems justified.It's no surprise this get a solid 10*s from me. What surprised me more was how INCREDIBLE it is to see this on a really big screen again... and with really great sound.There are so many standout moments to call out:Nolan's story-line for Inception is stunningly intricate. The 'science' is both nonsensical and plausible at the same time. The ""time element"" (this week revisited by Nolan in ""Tenet"") just works so brilliantly;The stunning 'practical effect' shots still amaze, 10 years later. How do you film a fight in a hotel corridor where the hotel is ""rolling down a hill""? You build a whole set that can revolve around its axis and put the actors in it like hamsters in a wheel! How do you drive a locomotive through rush-hour traffic? You drive a friggin' full-size locomotive through rush-hour traffic! In ""Dunkirk"" the lack of CGI was detrimental to the movie which needed to be 'bigger'. Here the lack of CGI is a big plus;I must have seen this movie a dozen times now. But one of the things that jumps out at you most when seeing it on the big screen again is the sound design. Hans Zimmer's glorious score - one of his very best in my book - stops to be replaced by a filling-loosening bass rumble during the slo-mo 'Jump' sequences. It's just superb.That final ten seconds! One of the best endings of any film....EVER!It's a cast to die for. Leonardo diCaprio as Cobb leads the cast with strong support - REALLY strong support - from the ensemble cast. Of that cast the acts, that standout are Ken Watanabe as Saito, Ellen Page as Ariadne and, particularly, Marion Cottilard as Cobb's dead wife Mal. Both Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are great, but come over a bit too cocky and smug on repeat watches!The old Nolan favourite - Michael Caine as Cobb's kid's grandfather (I don't think it's ever mentioned whether he is Cobb Snr). (Source: Warner Brothers).What makes the movie so compelling for me is not all of the whiz-bang practical effects, but the emotional wallop of the backstory between Cobb and his wife Mal. As the film digs deeper and deeper, so that emotional story intensifies: growing old together for over 50 years; wrinkled hand holding wrinkled hand. GULP.Blend that with his need of Cobb to see the faces of his children again - Nolan constantly teasing us with the prospect - and it drives the movie along at a completely different level of quality.It comes down to a personal preference. But there are a number of Christopher Nolan candidates that might make your list of his best films: ""Memento""? ""The Dark Knight""? ""Interstellar""? Perhaps for some people now (not me personally) ""Tenet""? But for me, ""Inception"" is his high-water mark of quality, and firmly in my top 10 favourite films of all time.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen",1
"Ride the kicks through the layers of a masterpiece. Chris Nolan continues to make his case as the best director of all-time! He combines an action film with a superior complex story. Fueled with multi-layers of plot( literally there are multiple layers of dreams the team must enter to plant inception) and a outstanding performance from a amazing ensemble, this movie is what I have been waiting for. A big budget film that doesn't go overboard with cgi and focuses on the main character battling his sub conscious demon while taking an elite team down the depths of another man's. This is one of few stories that contains, not one, but several climatic moments and kept me guessing throughout. Mr. Nolan makes a film that takes great thinking and at 2 1/2 hours is not for those with short attention spans. I have no doubt that anyone who views this can disagree. It goes without saying, but I will, a classic award winner in progress.",1
"Portrayed as the fight between good and evil, The Dark Knight tackles more than that. It tells us how the world isn't just black and white, and how darkness can spread like a disease. A masterpiece by Christopher Nolan, delving into the throes of the human psyche, it builds on the classic notion of moral good in the society and its visible manifestations. A corrupt city can achieve moral salvation, and so can an honest official succumb to darkness when tragedy strikes.
Heath Ledger puts on a show for us, ably sharing the screen is Christian Bale who revels in the role of Batman. The billionaire playboy of Gotham City tries to bring peace to a broken city in this thriller of a movie.",1

"As many reviewers have noted, this summer movie season...well, it's almost not deserving of being called a summer movie season at all. Sequels. Remakes. Reboots. Rehashes. Re-what-have-yous. Granted, they were not all bad, but neither were they all good. Along comes Christopher Nolan, Savior of the movie universe, with Inception.The psychological action-thriller centers on Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), a skilled ""extractor"". Cobb is a master of a specific kind of corporate espionage: he enters peoples' minds while they are asleep to retrieve secrets from their dreams.Cobb and his partner Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) are approached by the wealthy Saito (Ken Watanabe) to perform ""inception"": planting an idea instead of stealing one. Their target is Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy), the son of a terminally-ill tycoon. Saito wants Fischer to disband his father's empire.However, Dom is a deeply troubled individual, and with valid reason: he is wanted for the supposed murder of his wife Mallorie (Cotillard), and visions of his wife manifest themselves in the dreams Dom enters. Being a fugitive, Dom is unable to return to their children.Dom assembles a team to help perform the inception, consisting of Arthur, college graduate and ""dream architect"" Ariadne (Ellen Page), ""forger"" Eames (Tom Hardy) who impersonates others within a dream, Yusuf (Dileep Rao) the ""chemist"" who formulates the drugs needed to enter the dream state and Saito himself, as a ""tourist"" in the dream world.And then things get (even more) complex.In many ways, Inception, despite its mind-bending premise, is classic Christopher Nolan. Memento, Insomnia and the Prestige all display similar traits in that they enjoy playing with the audiences' minds. However, Nolan is a director who learns, and after gaining the experience of the big-budget Batman films, is able to translate his ideas into mind-blowing spectacle.Inception exemplifies the thinking man's blockbuster, and it is very rare that filmmakers of tent-pole summer fare treat their audiences like geniuses. After scores of films that are so painfully dumbed-down, it doesn't hurt to watch a brain cell-jolting flick like this one once in a while.Inception operates on its visuals: the notion that anything is possible within the world of the dream allowed production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas to go wild. The film includes such scenes as an entire city folding in on itself, a freight train running through a city, an assault on a fortress that wouldn't be out of place in a Bond movie and a desolate, abandoned dream city filled with crumbling buildings. One of the many great sequences in the film is a zero-gravity fight scene performed by Gordon-Levitt along the corridors of a hotel. Even for audiences jaded by the proliferation of ""wire-fu"" since the Matrix films, it's exciting.Inception's greatest asset however is arguably its emotional core that functions like a rope guiding the viewer through the labyrinth of story. Leonardo DiCaprio has carved a career out of playing emotionally-complex characters, Cobb indeed brings to mind DiCaprio's recent performance in Shutter Island. Cotillard is also commendable in that it's never easy to play a character who exists only as a figment of another character's imagination, and Cotillard does this hauntingly well.The rest of the cast, too, is an iron-clad ensemble. There is literally not one weak link, everybody is perfectly cast. Gordon-Levitt especially seems to be emerging as a bona fide movie star, after making a name for himself in smaller character films. Watanabe manages to be dignified yet possess a misleading sinister streak as the employer and money man.Tom Hardy is a hoot as the comic relief who is actually really useful. My favorite however (it could be just that I'm a 17-year-old male) is the lovely Ellen Page, who has no problems portraying the youngest yet deepest character in the film. My only complaint with regards to the cast is that Michael Caine, as Cobb's mentor and father-in-law, is woefully underused.If you're tired of being insulted by blockbusters that throw money at the screen and hope it sticks, then treat yourself to one of the best cinematic uses of money ever. There's no shortage of spectacle or intelligence in what I can safely say the best movie of the year. And it's only July! Or is it...",1
"I saw this movie few years back.i was immature, i didn't get what this movie was offering True Meaning Of Friendship,Patience, to see every Perspective of turns whether its hard or not we face during our lifetime..
Really a strong movie must watch",1
"This is one of my favorite films of 1999. In the trailers, it appears to be some kind of fight movie along the lines of Gymkata. Don't let this fool you. Fight Club is one of the most clever and entertaining films of recent years. It succeeds on every level. Everyone I have recommended this film to has enjoyed it a lot.",1
"Sequels nowadays are always craps. But The Dark Knight is a sequel that is even better than the original Batman Begins. Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates the characters we care about. Characters we can relate to our real lives. That's because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of entire production. IMAX cameras are used to produce such cool scenes to make better experiences.",1
"A 30-year-old boy living by himself in a condo with tons of different furniture with a business job to report the conditions of wrecked cars from his company that has no real friends just lives thinking to himself, ""This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time."" Suffering from a sleeping problem, he can never sleep well, hes never really awake or asleep. Not actually realizing he is in search for a life he never knew he wanted, he came across a single serving friend named, Tyler Durden. He met this friend on a airplane coming back from a job he had done. With many things alike between the two they both found each other very unique. After landing and exchanging words Tyler leaves a card behind describing his job, leaving his phone number for soap information, and address. It was a work card, Tyler Durden makes and sales soap for a living.Later on, after a complete disaster back at the condo, it is found destroyed from a horrible explosion. Nothing is left, and our friend has no one to call... Except a single serving friend named Tyler Durden.This movie goes through a friendship between the two, a madness that must be unleashed within' one, a girl that goes in between a bond, and most importantly... A club Tyler Durden creates, that club is called Fight Club, and Fight Club creates the Gods unwanted Children. Project Mayhem. In other words, complete chaos.This film is full of masterpiece quotes and cleaver ideas. It is a must see and is my second favorite movie. I suggest this movie for anyone, because it is one of the best movies ever made and includes so many things that are going to be remembered. Fight Club isn't just a movie, Fight Club is an inspiration. This movie will not be forgot.Remember, ""Its only after we have lost everything that we are free to do anything.""",1
"*** ENTERTAINING - STRONG POLITICAL BIAS *** Firstly, let me start by saying that this movie is entertaining and interesting, no matter how you define your political ideology.Secondly, this movie is about socialist anarchism. It depicts a guy who hates his job, considers it slavery, who gets fed up with consumerism and capitalism, and starts destroying private property with his secret syndicate of anarchist-socialist buddies.Of course, it's no surprise avowed liberals like Brad Pitt and Edward Norton would take on the roles for this film. It suits their political biases.Would I recommend watching it? Yes. Go check it out. Is it an insult to my intelligence too? Yes, it is.",1
"Shawshank Redemption is an amazing story about a prison break planned by Andy, and the journey it took to achieve his plan and a excellent movie. It is an amazing movie , i seen it four times already in past few years. Andy is one of my favorite characters in movie because of his polite, educated and cunning mind. The plan is a master escape plan and live his life they way he want it to be.takes the ""innocent man in prison"" theme and bends it at a different angle.Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison. This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph. And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life. What emerges can only be called a magnificently piece of art. This is what movies were meant to be.",1
"now you have to realise the true potential of the underdog. this film does and doesnt demand that you look for the deeper meaning, it has such a versitile appeal that if you lack in brain power there is still something there that will blow your mind .. i am a matrix fan also but you sometimes find yourself digging and clutching onto the idea that someone has finally nailed it, but fight club puts a deck of a mixture of aces and jokers and its up to you to take your pick on the different angles global and local (inside and out) of the mind and more of what seems to be extreme in the world..it has a specific black comedy side but by no means lightens the views and goals of this genius movie...",1
This movie is so good. I like it.,1
"This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my seventeen years.  The movie is highly underrated by film critics, but if you look at imdb's top 250 films you will see it is rated #1.  Tim Robbins gives his best performance, he plays a prisoner who is serving time for a crime he didn't commit.  I guarantee you, you will enjoy this movie.  Check out my other reviews!",1
"The Dark Knight was setting records even before its release. The hype was on since late 2007, and was only fueled by the sudden and tragic death of Heath Ledger in January. Did The Dark Knight live up to the massive expectations? Yes. Definitely.The story progresses very well, and the 2 and half hour running time flies by. Pay attention though, or you may get lost.The action is plentiful, and there is just the right amount. Not too much, not too little. There aren't too many explosions just for show, and the special effects look great.Performances Christian Bale is spot on as the tormented defender of Gotham. He gives a very believable performance in one scene of raw emotion that I won't spoil here.Michael Caine once again plays Alfred in a role that makes him a mentor/friend even more so than in Begins, or any of the older movies for that matter.Morgan Freeman also reprises his role as Lucius Fox, who once again supplies Bruce with the gadgets and cutting-edge technology he needs to combat crime.Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes from Batman Begins, plays Rachel Dawes, a pivotal character in the movie, and in the lives of Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent. Even if you think Gyllenhaal may not be much of a looker, she certainly has far more charisma than Holmes in the role.Newcomer Aaron Eckhart debuts in the series as Harvey Dent, the new District Attorney, and a shining ray of hope on the corrupt Gotham City. Batman thinks he may be the man who may make Gotham no longer need Batman. However, fans of the comics know who he is destined to become.And last, but most certainly not least, Heath Ledger.From the trailers alone, I could tell he was going to give a commanding performance, but I was not expecting this. Ledger completely disappears into the role, and is virtually unrecognizable. He easily gives the best performance of the movie as the psychopathic, sadistic Joker. It is unfortunate and sad he will not be able to reprise his role in the third film, if there will be one.The Dark Knight is easily the best film of the year so far, and by far the darkest. I won't say much, but don't be surprised if you don't get a happy ending.In my opinion, the best film of the year, and the best Batman and superhero movie ever.",1
Excelent i love this movie and i suggest you to watch it,1
"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe Dark Knight is the sequel to very entertaining Batman Begins. The Dark Knight tells the dark and disturbing tale of the rise and fall of the Joker. The story is full of dark and memorable moments that stay with you long after the film is over. The dialogue is fluid and the action is intense. The opening sequence is one of the best opening scenes ever. The ending shows us how evil can win in the end.The acting is amazing. Heath Ledger delivers his best performance ever. He plays the Joker with such easy and plays the character perfectly. He truly deserved the Oscar. Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman all perform very well.The pacing is very good. Christopher Nolan perfectly paces his complex and detailed story. The runtime is also very good for such a complex film.Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes in this film. Some could see this as annoying but Maggie does a good job portraying Rachel.Pros: Dark and disturbing story, amazing opening sequence, fluid dialogue, intense action, amazing acting, masterful performance by Heath Ledger, perfect pacing, amazing directing by Christopher Nolan, and a good runtimeCons: Having a replaced actor can be a downsideOverall Rating 9.8P.S. The Dark Knight is one of the greatest superhero films of all time. I would highly recommend it.",1
"As I was saying just amazing, it makes you laugh, cry and even shout",1
"This movie the most one of the most greatest movies of all time in my opinion. It features great story, great characters as well as a amusing and sad plot. There are some sad moments in the movie like when the old librarian hung himself because he couldn't live outside of the big house and so on. And there is some feel good moments like when Red got released and when Andy escaped from the prison after twenty years. And it was very frustrating when the student Andy was teaching got shoot because it would prove Andy innocent and for him to be set free. Andy tries his best to fit into Shawshank prison by making little stone statues and a chess set. Where does he get the stone you ask? Well you have to watch it and find out because it is the most genius plan that any prisoner has come up with to escape Shawshank. In conclusion I would absolutely recommend this to any fan of cinema, Steven King, drama, comedy or tragedy then this film is the best for you.",1
Best joker ever. heath ledger is by faaar the best joker.,1
"Amazing movie front the discovery of things to the visualization. The movie is mind blowing, makes you wants to think hard to create something out of the ordinary. The developing and creativity must've been time consuming, but it must've been worth the energy and time that it took to create this film. All actors were amazing at telling the story and developing an understudying of what the viewers want to watch. I enjoyed watching this film and continue to watch it, I don't think i could get tired of the plot. There are few films that have such a structural imagination to a film and that match what the plot of the story consist of. But in overall I enjoyed it and its one of my favorite films to watch, not only because of the actors involved but because it was such a drawing and interesting film to let my eyes and brain discover its ending.",1
"My favorite movie ever.  These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie.  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie, but this is very entertaining.  Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven).  Soon the warden, played by Bob Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other things.  It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it.  Tim Robbins is great in the lead.  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden.  William Sadler (Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict.  Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards.  Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts.  A must see.",1
"When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be free. And "" don't never forget,hope is good something and good somethings never die "" this sentence which passes in the film, I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this film, I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important for every watcher, Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you :)",1
This movie is really great. Teaches some of the important life lessons. This movie shows what prison does to a person and how someone can cope with it. How a person serving sentence becomes when he is released. The bullshits you have to go through in the prison. I am thrilled with the overall experience. No wonder this movie has stayed at the top of the IMDb ranking list for a long time. Enjoy it while you can.,1
"I cried. When I saw this movie at at theater in mid-town Manhattan I found myself at a low point in my life. On a whim I chose this movie not really knowing anything about it and not being a regular movie goer I took a chance. The struggles that the main characters endured resonated with me so much so that I cried. It's unusual for me to cry especially when the story line can be loosely characterized as ""male bonding"" through hardship. All in all I found myself watching this movie a number of times over the years since it first came out in the theaters.It's uplifting and gives one a realistic perspective of what a segment of life might have been like in the 60's, I think that's the time period this movie is placed in. The ""good"" guy sticks it to the bad guy and the bad guy's eventually get their freedom which they savor immensely.",1
One of the best movies and i loved Heath Ledger s acting.,1
"First of all,this film is one of the attractive films I have ever seen.The initial reason that attract my attention is its scenario.As you know,inception is a science fiction film.Therefore,it seems so complicated.But,every moment of this film holds your attention thanks to its scenario.Its scenario is about dream and subconscious.There is a team,which steals valuable secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams.Dom Cobb leads the team,he enters the minds of powerful people and takes their ideas.But this is not so simple.If he can do impossible;planting an idea rather than stealing.When I compared to another films,inception is very good in many ways.At this moment,the actors and actresses stand out.Leonardo Dicaprio's performance is magnificent.In addition to Dicaprio,Joseph Gordon,Ellen Page and Tom Hardy are very good in their roles.Special effects are perfect,too.To enjoy this film,you should watch every second of film.On the other hand,because of too many distracts,you will be confused.When the film ends,you will want to watch again.You will find new things about dreams,every time.Inception is directed by Christopher Nolan.He directed The Prestige,Insomnia,too.In addition to these,film's musics are effective.Even though you are confused about film at the end of it,you never bore.To summarize,film includes the best things,from scenario to actors and actresses.",1
"Isn't this true of modern people, the clown just said a fact that no one dare to admit, modern people are becoming more selfish, mean, cruel and cruel. Rather than living in such a despicable way, it is better to die all the way, death is redemption. Of course, this lunatic theory is untenable. The question is: Are we clowns who are crazy?",1
"Definitely, one of the best movies ever. The plot, the book, the music, and, certainly, the two main actors ( Norton and Pitt) play at they best. In my country, it was a short time on the cinemas, but whoever saw it had the best comments on it. I won´t say the plot - it is already summarized - you have to EXPERIENCE it to know  how this movie is at the very top of the 250 top movies. All I can say is I saw it on cinema, and I HAD to buy it on VHS first, and, a friend of mine on DVD. Truly, a work of art. Don´t miss it",1
"As soon as I watched Fight Club at a friends house sometime in the year 2000, after it was released, I was amazed and fascinated by it. Fight Club is truly a film of the 21st century, revealing all the flaws in modern day society and bluntly verifying, challenging, and exhibiting philosophical ideas while enlightening all who watch it.Undoubtely, this movie faced much criticism in-part because it challenged the structure of society itself. The concept of giving up all hope is freedom is one of the best, and all extra subtle philosophies offered, and the experience of the movie itself is just truly a masterpiece. Fight Club was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, who is the best modern novelist in the world. With no positive answers for anyone, this movie offers an inner satisfaction of destructive concepts.The collaboration which is perfect for the development of this film was great because it had superb acting from both Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and especially Edward Norton (Edward Norton who enjoys making dysfunctional films). The film had a great connection between director David Fincher who incorporated his fantastic CGI abilities to the film along with the genius of novelist Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck Palahniuk who should be equally praised as well, writes in 1st-person narrative, with short-sentences and sentences contrasting with detail, pin-pointing perfection, Palahniuk expresses his dark (very unique) 1st-person experience in his book.Fight Club is a film that will be misunderstood by many, but from those who do understand it, will get too experience a contemporary masterpiece that reveals a true evolution in all ideas the lie in the destructive side of humanitarian spectrum.10/10",1
"Inception is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life! It is just a wonderful film with all the intricate elements, intelligence, and most of all the incredible complex idea of the movie. The film's beauty is completed from the astounding performance of this huge cast, Nolan's magnificent direction and touches to the film, and Zimmer's breath taking music.",1
"There are a very few movies that make you think ,think about the things that are important in life, things that truly matter and The Shawshank Redemption is surely one of those movies. It teaches you that life will put you in situations which you must not have imagined yourself to be in ever and how you can survive those situations.
You will learn something new every time you watch it.",1
All in this film is perfect. The story catches you everytime you see it.,1
"If there's one thing I like more than a beyond unbelievable movie is a beyond unbelievable movie with a beyond unbelievable ending.Do you get the hints so far? ""The Dark Knight"" has been raved by its critics, given a lot of 10/10s for its great story, and obviously, a high box office. I mean, who doesn't want to see the Joker toy around with Batman? I mean, as far as I'm concerned, there's no better match-up in the comic world than Batman and the Joker. And if there is, then none is better on the movie screen.Actors: 9 | The fact is...oh, what the heck, they were all beyond unbelievable. Christian Bale has once again proved to be the ultimate Batman in this movie. Bale was better in the sequel than the latter and the Batman of today was well-done than the previous time. I mean, the previous movie was all about Bruce Wayne and how he became Batman and how he got to where he was. This movie finally showed more action, and Bale delivered it. But Batman was not the man of the 2.5 hours. My friends, I introduce you to Heath Ledger.If there is one thing I know in my lifetime (a short lifetime, yes, but a lifetime none the less), Heath Ledger probably made one of, if not the best individual performance of all-time. No, I'm not saying that because he's dead?or at least trying not to be bias towards that end. However, if Heath Ledger doesn't win an Oscar for his performance as the Joker, the loss would be a joke. I've seen (along with my more comic-obsessed brother) many Batman movies before this series, and I've seen the Joker. Of course, the Jokers were?acceptable. But Heath Ledger made the Joker. He made it HIS. Whatever Ledger did (death related or not), he did a performance of a lifetime, and of all-time.Now, Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal were great additions to the film. And of course, Morgan Freemen and Gary Oldman were fantastic in their roles. However, as much as I loved this movie, Katie Holmes should have adjusted her schedule to reprise her role. I mean, COME ON! IT'S BATMAN! But alas, I shouldn't hurt the movies rating for someone's insignificant schedule?but I will. However, Maggie did an excellent job, as I saw Rachel 100% throughout the movie.Cinematography: 10 | Christopher Nolan had a great handle on the movie, and there's no other director I would have put into the chair. I mean, the guy was phenomenal in seeing what we see. He directed such a great cast to the best of his ability and got the best movie possibly of all-time. When you think of the greatest directors (Steven Spielberg, George Lucas), it's time to put Christopher Nolan up for consideration. The guy has been nothing but money since Memento in 2000. Also, big props to his brother, Jonathan, for helping the screenplay and David Goyer for story. Every single scene had a purpose, and the audience was always on high-alert.Music: 9 | I have to be bias here. I've always been a Hans Zimmer fan. I'm generally fond of James Newton Howard's work. So automatically, they get an 8 just for being amazing composers in the first place. Yet, they earn their 9th star rating with perfect colors. The music turned your emotions and literally told the story. If one alternation was made, it would have ruined it. Zimmer and Howard were once again perfect. And thank you?thank you, thank you, thank you for not over-playing the Batman Theme.Believability: 10 | If there's one thing I have to add to this, it's that it's just believable. How could you leave the theater knowing full well that you have no clue what could happen? It was that amazing. It made you stay in your seat, no matter how much you want to go to the bathroom.Overall: 10 | All in all, if the box office doesn't tell you anything these days, I'll tell you that it does. The Dark Knight broke the opening day and weekend box office with $158 million worldwide, beating Spiderman 3 in both categories. It also is the most highly-acclaimed movie of the year by everyone: critics, fans, and everyone in between.Despite two 9s and two 10s, I'll give Batman the ten it deserves. It was perfect in almost every way imaginable, and there's just no way it could have been changed to make it better. It's a great shame that with this great success that Heath Ledger had to leave this world from us. A sequel? Difficult with Heath gone . Difficult with the way the Dark Knight ends. Difficult with the way the movie business is. Though I expect a sequel, don't expect one soon. If I were them, I'd wait for a long time?perhaps 4-5 years before another movie. There's just no way that this movie can be topped. It just can't be done.I called it first?Heath Ledger (no matter how he got it) wins the Academy Award for Best Performance.I still have goosebumps from that movie. Just plain beyond unbelievable.",1
"Well the first thing I wanted to do after seeing Fight Club for the first was to see it all over again. Cause this movie is simply brillant. It has everything from violence to humour. I wasn't expect to laugh at all before to see it. The trailer is not really good cause it shows all the violent scene and give you a bad general idea of the atmosphere of the movie. But it's impossible to gave you an idea of what the movie is in two minutes. As it's almost impossible to resumate the movie. Anyway I had a lots of good laugh. But the general humour and mood of the movie is kinda cynical and dark. It's also a great cristism of today American Society and American Way to Live. Since I can't resume this movie I just can tell you that you'll feel like smarter after seen this movie and you'll maybe stop buying Smart Mop after seeing it on Infomertials. It might open your eyes too about your way of life and change for ever you vision of the U.S.A . Some might find it all fucked up. But I think it's one of the ten best movie ever made. The only thing I have to tell you is ""Go see it twice for fully understand everything in this movie"" (4 or 5 times would be mendatory for low IQs =) Thanks David Fincher for this brillant movie And aslo thx to every actors (and of course Actresses) for their wonderfull performences !",1
"The movie had me on the edge of my seat! Everything about it was great. The camera angle and cinematics were on point. It's a movie to watch for ages to come. the plot is great. The cast of actors were amazing, as well as the producer and director.",1
"It's not ALL style and NO substance, but the film makers obviously were much more concerned with looking cool than with presenting a story which held together or had a consistent level of reality-vs-fantasy. The surprise twist towards the end was very clever, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it didn't explain a large number of earlier-on scenes and situations. But hey, it's cool! Dazzling camera work! Astonishing effects! Grooving music! (Sorry, folks, that's great for a TV commercial, not a feature film)",1
"Even after over a decade of Marvel movies and superhero movies in general becoming a yearly thing, The Dark Knight still holds up as one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) superhero movies ever made.",1
"It's not difficult to get carried away describing the love, skill, heart, and expertise of the cast and crew of this movie, but the juggernaut driving the energy is C.Nolan.As a fan, take me with a pinch of salt, however the elements that still evoke emotion, and resonated for a long time following the end credits, were the onion skin layers of narrative. An action movie with spectacle, a troubled vigilante whose duality mirrors the tragic Harvey Dent, and the anarchic Joker, who would let the world burn, just to see what happens. Nolan's allegoric references to post 911 cultural tropes worked perfectly, the best since 2005's Battlestar Galactica.A classic.",1
"First off let me explain my style of critiquing a movie. When I go see a movie I judge it by how entertained I was during and after the movie. Most of the time I am not bothered by little plot holes and slightly above average acting. However if I see extreme plot holes and terrible acting (Nicholas Cage) I will bash those aspects of the movie.From the very beginning of the movie it is obvious that Christopher Nolan has done it again by choosing the musical genius, Hans Zimmer. His sudden changes from epic and loud music to a faint violin or piano truly take this movie to the next level. The final song fits so incredibly well with the ending of the movie that it has given me chills *five* out of *five* times...Clearly any movie that makes a person see a movie five times has good acting, right? Correct. Such good acting that it doesn't even seem like acting in the slightest bit. Leonardo DiCaprio and his supporting acting group act at such a high level that is seems that the person watching the movie isn't even watching the movie. Every time I have seen the movie I have felt like a member of Cobb's(DiCaprio) dream crew. All of the actors and actresses in this movie deserve an academy award for this movie.You know what supports great acting? A story. An emotional story. An emotionally thrilling story. An emotionally thrilling story that has twists and turns. Inception is just that. The relationships between Cobb(DiCaprio) and Mal(Cotillard), Cobb(DiCaprio) and Ariadne(Page), and Robert Fisher(Murphy) and his father(Postlethwaite) were so emotionally convincing that the entire audience would hold their breath when each pair would talk to one another. I can honestly say, without ruining anything, that I was teary-eyed several times during the movie. The plot of this story is done so well that I have been left speechless and confused after each of my 5 experiences with this movie.Stop reading this now and go watch Inception now...PS: Christopher Nolan, congrats on the greatest movie of all time. I believe that your film will be the film that finally surpasses The Shawshank Redemption as the number one film on IMDb.",1
"Christopher Nolan has made this a masterpiece. Every movie he has made has been wonderful: Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, and at the top of the list is Inception. There was great music by Hans Zimmer. The concept of inception is hard to believe. You can only DREAM about it. It's amazing how you can enter to people's minds through dreams. Then you have inception in which you have to implant an idea in their head. Leonardo DiCaprio (Dom Cobb) was amazing. Joseph Gordan-Levitt (Arthur) was amazing, too. Christopher Nolan made a box office record with Inception, beating The Dark Knight which was also Nolan's movie. Good job Nolan.",1
This is absolutely the best movie in the superhero movie history that has ever been made,1
"I have never been a SciFi fan and have also never seen a C. Nolan film, apart from the Dark Knight two years ago, which I found OK, but not overwhelming (don't kill me). I, however, think that Leo di Caprio is one of the finest actors ever, and probably the best of this generation. So I usually go to see all of his movies, independent of the genre.Inception literally made me sit on the edge of my seat. This is one of the most exhilarating, exiting, touching, moving, mind-bending and eventually mind-blowing movies I have ever seen. Honestly, I saw it about three days ago and have thought about it constantly ever since. I am a big film fan and watch movies all the time, but this rarely happens. I will definitely watch Inception once or twice (or ....) more.di Caprio is simply brilliant (and this will hopefully finally bring him the Oscar he has deserved for so long), as are all others, not one actor is a mis-fit.As others here, I am somehow at a loss for words and cannot really describe how unbelievably terrific I find this movie - all I can say is: YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!",1
"The first time I made this movie, for one, I made the big mistake of not having seen Batman Begins in a few years. So, when I went I missed a good deal of meaning behind some important lines because I was too busy figuring out how things that occurred in Batman Begins related to what was going on in The Dark Knight.So, right after I saw The Dark Knight for the first time, I watched Begins again.This time I caught on to a lot more of the dialog in some very important scenes, and the movie was much more meaningful! So, if anyone else has seen this movie once and found themselves confused at some parts... go see it again! You'll find that the movie is even deeper than you thought was. You'll find out that every piece of dialog in this film is crucial to pay attention to. And mostly, you'll find that things you thought didn't link very well before, link perfectly.",1
"Well.........where do I begin? I have no idea.Heath Ledger, given an award after he died. The man was a drug addict and simply went too far. Not such a great performance in the film actually. Mediocre. But because he went tits up, his role was portrayed as one of the greatest ever. Nonsense. Like I said. Mediocre.As far as Batman is concerned, he definitely needs some throat lozenges. What a crock with that voice they had him use.It was less than halfway through when I lost all interest and forgot what the plot was. If there was one. The only reason I saw the ending credits was simply because of the fact that I needed some background noise for the evening.You want some real Batman! Watch the 60's TV show. Campy...yes. Phony...yes. Utterly ridiculous...yes. But, it was Batman and enjoyable.In one sentence.......""the worst ever"".......",1
"I can't say enough about this film its simply the King of Kings when it comes to movies.Other movies might have something better, but put all the contents of a great movie together and this one hast is all Narration, acting, humour, direction, story, suspense, soundtrack...the full package.Its a powerful movie and I don't know how you can keep your emotions in check with such a intense story. Its a tragedy this didn't win an Oscar for best picture over Forrest Gump...for me there isn't many movies that possess the overall strength of this movie, hence why its still #1 in on IMDb and top 5 on many other reputable internet sites.",1
"I didn't expect to see such a thought provoking film when I went to see the movie. I was thinking it would pretty much be a bizarre fighting movie. Plus I didn't figure out the surprise at the end of the movie till about 20 seconds before they made it obvious, very well done.",1
This film is a classic no other similar film will beat it,1
"This movie...where to begin. Well it's hard to believe that when I sat down to watch this movie, that I was expecting a grim depressing movie, about how bad prison life could be. The main reason I watched it was because I am a Stephen King fan, and I heard this one was the best. So I sat down to watch it, and I was fully prepared to feel depressed, and also sad. And when I finished watching the movie, how did I feel...there is no way to say it other than: The exact opposite. I felt uplifted, happy, and after watching the ending, I simply said that this was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. What I liked about it so much is mainly the plot, and the characters. Andy Dusfrene, and Ellis 'Red' Redding are prisoners in the Eastern Maine Penitentiary, known as Shawshank. Andy spends over twenty years in the prison, Red even longer. And when I was watching I could feel (even though it is not shown physically) the years passing. The movie spends the first 3 quarters of the movie at the prison, and you really get to know it, and it's inhabitants, very well. The character you get to know best though is Andy. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself, but there is so much more to him then that. In the twenty years he spends there he manages to earn the respect of his fellow prisoners (particularly Red), the prison guards, and the cruel warden Samuel Norton. Then one day he mysteriously disappears. Or to be exact, he escapes, the first man to ever escape from that prison. It takes him twenty years to deceive all the guards, that he is a quiet honest person, that would never try to escape. During this whole time he was planning his escape, right from the start when he asked Red if he could find him (Andy) a rock pick. It took him twenty years to do all this...hat's devotion if I've ever seen it, and that's why I loved his character. Then there's the last 15-20 minutes of the film which take place outside the prison. The last 5 minutes though, when Red (who is also a fairly likable character) decides to reunite with the escaped Andy, it becomes very emotional, and a truly beautiful piece of cinema. So people say this is the best Stephen King adaptation of them all, but I think calling this movie a Stephen King movie, is like calling The Lord of the Rings a blockbuster trilogy, it just doesn't quite cut it.In fact I simply must say that this may just be the best movie ever made. It has an excellent plot, gritty and realistic setting, a sense of hopefulness (despite being a prison movies), extremely likable, and relatable characters and an ending that can truly touch the heart and soul of many viewers. It is absolutely 10/10",1
"Wow, this is really the best movie ever made. Even though this movie contained a few mistakes, I'd like to rate it full-on-full. I want to tell this to all the people who haven't seen the movie, it's a must watch. You might think that 'Forrest Gump', The Best Picture Oscar winner can beat it, let me tell you, IT CANNOT! I'm serious! It is about a man, Andy Dufresne who has been put behind the bars for the murder of his wife and her lover, a Professional Golf player. But just like every other man in The Shawshank Prison, he too is innocent. Then he meets a, Ellis Boyd Redding, a smuggler/businessman and makes friends with him and his gang. Andy then asks him for a small rock hammer witch is soon delivered to him. He one day sees the names of prisoners written in the cell. He to goes to writ his name on the wall that is so weak that is comes out after which, he starts digging a hole in the wall. After 20 years of being in the jail and realizing how corrupt the warden is when he kills his friend, he escapes the prison and gets the warden so good that he suicides. The last thing that I'd like to say is that it should be rated 9.5 on IMDb but still, that's just a suggestion. 9.3 is good.",1
"Fight Club is multi-faceted movie about a man who is deeply unsatisfied with his life in the modern age, even with all the trappings of success that much of our society is based on, and decides to go off the beaten path to find his own personal satisfaction. From that point on the movie spirals out of control and into the abyss. This is a good thing. The movie holds many meanings and shows the characters in favorable and unfavorable ways. It does not try to cast things in a typical good and evil view point, nor does it say whether the choices the protagonist and the rest of the cast make are sound ones. One of the things it does do is look into the nature of our past, viewing the structure of our society and analyzing why we do what we do to live. It isn't until the narrator (Edward Norton) begins to destroy himself that he finally comes to realize what matters to him. That is when he meets two important characters, Marla Singer and Tyler Durden. It is during this time that the narrator escapes from his normal life by hosting with Tyler an underground fight club that evolved from the two just fighting outside of a local bar. Taking in Tyler's view on life, which is somewhat refreshing and scary at the same time, they form a close bond strongly resembling a married couple. The two do everything together and the narrator begins to emulate Tyler more and more, all the while the fight club grows stronger and stronger until it has become this cult-like phenomenon with Tyler and the narrator as leaders making rules for conducting fight club. Anarchy and non-conformity is their message, which I believe is meant to underscore the irony of fight club and their non-conformist, fight the man attitude. As the group evolves into something more dangerous, this irony becomes more apparent in the way those who once questioned the established authority, now blindly follow their ""non-conformist"" new group. Its been a little over a decade since Fight Club ""enlightened"" me, but it still gives me the same conflicting feelings about its message and the nature of humanity in general. There are those who would take it at its face value and see nothing but frustrated, grown men beating each other senselessly, and that's a shame because there is definitely much more going on then that. David Fincher has crafted an excellent movie: it's disgustingly stylish in its execution...almost too much, if that's possible. The sound track, done by the Dust Brothers burrowed it's way into my brain and never left. The movie would not be the same without it. As far as the actors performances, Ed Norton and Brad Pitt both have a strong rapport and the scenes come off naturally, while Helena Bonham Carter's Marla is hauntingly tragic, and filled with a desperate, but subtle sadness to her. At the time of the original screening this movie polarized people into the two camps of love or hate, due to it's ability to offended or amaze, but I wouldn't have it any other way",1
"Let me just start by saying if you think this movie might not be for you, just watch it. Actually, when I was in the 7th grade my friend and I visited the Mansfield Reformatory (just because we wanted to see if it was haunted) unknowing my soon to be favorite movie was filmed there. Fast forward a year and everything I had heard on our tour of the Mansfield Reformatory about how awesome Shawshank Redemption was, I finally found out.The movie is not something I would typically watch but the story is just incredible. Andy, one of the main actors is a banker and sentenced for the supposed ""murder"" of his wife. Andy goes through for lack of better terms complete hell until he finds his place within the prison and plans to escape because he is truly innocent. Throughout Andy's journey in the prison, you feel as if you are stuck there with him. His frustrations are your frustrations and you wish you could prove his innocence. Through various factors such as sound, lighting, the location (Mansfield Reformatory), and actors have you glued to the screen seeing if Andy can escape. I won't give too much more away for this amazing film but please just watch it, I promise you will not be disappointed.",1
"This is a strangely action packed movie, but in a different way so you feel the rush, the adrenaline and you don't know exactly why... For me, this movie was out of this world completely! Fullfiled with plot twists and unexpected actions (and reactions), you won't be the same when the movie ends! You get to the end and think ""What am i actually doing with my life?""... Its a MUST to see this movie, trust me in this one ;) The only thing, in my case, that partially cut my fun was that when i saw this movie, i already had spoilers, and in this specific movie, when you have spoilers, it will be a disgrace, 'cause you know what will happen and this movie depends on the unexpected to be successful! So if your gonna watch, then don't ask nobody how the movie is or whatever...Just see, you won't regret! ;)",1
"Amazing for comic book fans and non comic book fans alike.
A great watch that isn't overcomplicated and can keep the audience on edge.",1
"I have always enjoyed David Fincher's films.  I still think that Alien 3 is the best of the series.  Although Se7en brought Fincher into notariety, Fight Club could make him as well known as James Cameron, or Tim Burton. Fight Club may be the best film of the year.  The script is great and the directing makes it even better.  The acting is superb.  Ed Norton is great as always (has he ever been bad in a film?).  And Brad Pitt proves once again that he is more than a pretty boy.  Even Meatloaf is great.  This is the type of film that you will want to see at least two or three times. Fight Club.  Go see it.",1
"Inception is a movie definitely worth watching. The story line was a little bit difficult at first to really understand. This was mainly because I first watched it when my English really wasn't up to scratch. The second time I watched it understood how well the story had been told in this movie. By the way, the fact that I watched a movie for a second time already says something about how good it is. Also Leonardo Di Caprio is one of my favorite actors, and he didn't disappoint me in this movie. The music is sublime. Hans Zimmer is one of the best sound track creators of all time. When I look up a movie I really like, it surprises me how often I see Hans Zimmer as sound track creator. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I really recommend you do as soon as possible.Greetings, TheWombatGuru",1
"And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight.While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater.I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.",1
"It honestly is a tough movie to understand; I had to watch it at least twice to fully understand it. It's always going back and forward in the past and present, which is the most complicated to understand because you're kind of confused. But this movie is so intense, interesting and so amazing! The story is honestly amazing with such wonderful ideas. It makes you think a lot way more once you saw the movie and it makes you understand things and see those in a different point of view. Plus, the actors are truly amazing and play really well. Marion Cotillard et Leonardo DiCaprio did such a good job in this one together! I definitely recommend this movie!",1
"I thing What Heath Ledger has portrayed in ""the dark knight"" is a one in a life time role... I can't imagine a person acting like this... with so much passion... I like especially the two scenes 1st where Batman and Joker meet in the Interrogation room and the 2nd my favorite is when Joker meets Dent in the hospital... simply fantastic... I love watching these two scenes again and again... The other beautiful thing is that he has done fabulous job as a psycho character... the viewer could actually feel that he is originally like that... to take a character so deep and bring it into a reality is a work of a total dedication and art... health ledger you are simply amazing... may your soul rest in peace...",1
"The film itself is a clever mashup of modern genres. The acting is superb all the way through, with one notable character (guess who?). We have a hero (Batman) and we have a villain (The Joker), for me they are just vehicles to tell the story. One of which human morals, clash of instincts and then spectacular action blended with suspenseful scene, after scene-storytelling ripped with mystery and twists. The credit goes to the entire crew, who have made a modern masterpiece, albeit a sequel, none shall topple the gripping sounds, dialogue and pictures we so much want to see in cinema. I recommend seeing Batman Begins first, a terrific standalone film itself. Then prepare thyself for action, heart and excellent acting, cinematography and directing but most of all - the edge of your seat film that will not disappoint.",1
"Brilliant. Exquisit. Sublime.... you cant use enough superlatives to describe The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan you are the man! I am officially a HUGE Batman fan now!!!!!! Other film makers please take note, this is what it takes to make a great film. Writing. Directing. Acting. Everything else flows from those core elements.I read somewhere that Nolan is sceptical about a third. I hope that is not true! This movie will be long remembered and will get better with each viewing. I cant wait reserve my edge of the seat again this weekend.Bravo to all concerned!",1
Sometimes you wonder if there ever will be a movie as strong as Godfather or even close to it. You even wonder if there would be a performance as good as Al pacino in Godfather. But Dark Knight delivers and what a way to DELIVER!. Heath Ledger's untimely death did create a lot of hype to the film. However it has paid off completely. Movie is Disturbing because of Heath Ledgers Oscar winning performance. Movie is Breathtaking because of Nolans wonderful direction. Movie has the right hero in the role played by Christian Bale. It has just about everything to make US viewers come out of the theater's completely Blown away by just about Everything. When i watched BATMAN BEGINS I thought to myself 'wow... what a movie'. But when i watched the Dark Knight I cannot describe it in words to show what i actually felt during the movie.. Some scenes were soooooo brilliant that you are thinking to yourself 'how the hell can someone come up with that imagination??' and Nolan has actually come out like a King of Directors because His imagination in the movie beats almost everyone in the business. He is as good as anyone out there. Only one thing I have got to say and that is .. you are showing no respect to the movie by watching it just ONCE. Go and SEE IT TWICE THRICE FOUR TIMES.. AND you would still come out of the theater's BLOWN AWAY!!!!!....,1
"What is Fight Club? Like its main character, it takes on many different identities and seems like quite the epic journey to self-realization. Sometimes it's an action flick. Other times it's a thriller. Maybe even a light comedy, and it's all thrown into a philosophical masterpiece. Fight Club tells the story of the narrator (Edward Norton) whose life is in turmoil due to an extreme case of insomnia. He turns to self-help groups, which cures his insomnia because he sees people who are worse than him. The character is never given a name because he cannot attain a true identity. He is lost within the world as another soul with nothing to live for. The director (David Fincher) injects a lot of comedic moments throughout the film that work quite well. It is in fact a dark comedy, for example when they joke about a woman with cancer. Except, even with this subject matter, you find yourself laughing at what she and the narrator says. In turn, you feel disgusted with yourself and find yourself staring eye to eye with Edward Norton's character. He too is disgusted with his entire life and is stuck in this endless cycle. He then meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, who seems to know exactly who he is inside. He is everything that people are not, specifically the narrator. I found myself wanting to be Tyler Durden mainly because of the way he handles himself. Brad Pitt's performance is wonderfully captivating as he teeters on becoming a psycho and yet you want to join in with that madness.They both decide to start a fight club in which people fight with one another in order to feel something again in their numbing worlds. The film is definitely geared towards the younger audience, but then again if you dislike the world at points of your life, you can relate. The only real flaw within the film is it gets a little off track. It delves into the excessive and overdone specifically with the ""space monkey"" scenes, but is able to get on again after a while. By the end of the film, the viewer is exhausted as the narrator aimlessly tries to find Tyler again after he leaves him. Although, he doesn't really need to find him ever again. I could tell you why, but that would be breaking the rules of Fight Club. The film successfully uses this plot twist to further its themes, but also add another dimension to the story for the audience.The film is able to work on many levels due to the amount of relating the audience can do with their own life. This is a story about how society is one big commercial. They are rebelling, specifically Edward Norton's character, towards that feeling and creating a new one by feeling a fist against their cheekbone. They are all so infuriated that by the end of the film, they watch the credit card buildings burn down to the ground. But none of them are scared, they know who they are and that's all that matters. The film touches on so many different subjects and tries to cover every reach of the human emotion. This is its brilliance and pitfall. It overreaches at some points, but grabs hold of something much greater at others. The film makes the viewer think on a grand scale and gives them questions. I still haven't been able to shake it off even after ten viewings. By the end of the film you won't be asking yourself what is Fight Club, but who am I?",1
Looveee this movie; exceptional!! So much so that it led me to seek out other masterpiece brilliantly made movies. a level of cinematic genius i had never experienced before in the past. like no other movie you will ever see,1
"I was wondered while seeing the top rated imdb movies list that what is so special about this movie which makes it stand at the top #1 rated movie,but after watching it I will definitely say that this movie has each and every right to be in no.1 spot what a pure classic cult film,the best it's a guide to the the entire society and ppl hatts of to the whole team.!!!!!",1
"If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and objective value, cinema does not get much better than this.",1
Great movie..great characters..great camera work. I love the series. I think everyone will be gripping their seat. Good laughs,1
"What the hell such a messy film! The joker simply can commit various crimes just because fulfilling the plot requirements. He can do any thing he can regardless of the possibility of doing so, such as setting up wires in the hospital and inserting a mobile phone in a man's stomach. Many parts have no further explanation, especially the part joker crashes the party, what the audience can see just batman and Racel talking love stuff, but what about the joker??? I hate Chistopher Nolan using tricks to cheat audience. However, many guys who rate more 8/10 for this films i think really so stupid being cheated by the GREAT director.The rubbish batman have no use in the whole movie. What he done is simply the cops doing.Anyway, this movie not suck, but not very good. It DOESNOT worth so much high ranking. Many stupid guys are being cheated, they cannot see the rubbish stuff of the movie!",1
"I saw the movie without seeing any adds or hearing anything about it. I have always liked DiCaprio movies so I went to see this one and I was pleasantly surprised, I thought it would be good and it turned out to be great. My personal opinion is that this movie is worth 9/10 and I would have thought that the average user would rate it an 8. But I simply cannot believe anyone would rate Inception lower than 7.Maybe the IMDb's average rating (and rank in top 10) is a bit high, but I have seen a lot of reviews where people think the movie is worth 4 and rated it 1 because 'they want to lower the average'. When you think the movie is worth 4, rate it 4. The average rating is called average for a reason, it is ridiculous to give extremely low grades just to so the average rating matches your opinion. People who do so are missing the whole concept.D.",1
"Such a great film, loved every second of it, so well put together and the post production team must be really proud of themselves.",1
"Compelling story, brilliant casting, chilling cinematography, and, simply put, a really cool score. These are just a few key elements that went into making Fincher's masterpiece. It's exciting, it's powerful, and it will twist the viewer's mind in ways no other film has before. Fight Club is a perfect film for any contributing member of society, especially those who would consider themselves in any unsatisfactory form of routine. The story pulls you in and holds on tight, all the way until the end. When people ask me what my top 5 favorite films of all time are, Fight Club is always included in that list. It's obvious that Fight Club is, without a doubt, one of the most influential films of this generation.",1
"The visuals of this movie always stood out to me when I was younger. I couldn't ever watch it until years later when I watched it with my dad who eventually didn't want to watch more of it. When I finally got around to seeing the whole thing the first time I loved it, maybe not so much the ending.
After watching this many times I still enjoy coming back to it for certain scenes. This movie is legendary and has unforgettable moments. The opening credits, the visuals with Edward norton picking furniture for his house. The movie has a very original vibe and look.
I knock off points because of plot holes and overall I feel the message of the movie is confused and nihilistic. It feels like an edgy teenager who thinks deep but incredibly narrowly.
Still though it's a fun watch when it's on tv, it's not worth buying.",1
"One of the most gripping movies of all time. Its a fantastic journey which has three characteristics:1. It would take a really long time to complete. He has a feel for how long it would take - but he doesn't know that exactly. And that feel changes every day as well.2. He can get caught at any point - in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end - literally on any given day until he is done - and if he is caught, all his efforts up to that point add up to nothing. The net effect of getting caught would be negative, in the form of additional punishment, added with absolutely no scope of receiving a parole thereafter3. The end result is binary: If he gets caught, twenty years' effort adds up to nothing. On the other hand, if he succeeds, he can be a free man and live the rest of his life happily.If you think about it, the exact same characteristics are shared by anyone working on a Startup (in addition to the fact that only fools would embark on a journey with these characteristics):1. It would take a really long time to complete. You have a feel for how long it would take - but you don't know that exactly. Besides, this feel changes everyday.
2. You can fail at any point- in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end - literally on any given day until you are done - and if you fail, all your efforts up to that point add up to nothing. The net effect of a failure would be negative, in the form of lost investment, opportunity costs, and a bunch of significant 'could have beens'
3. The end result is binary: If you fail, you will feel that your efforts added up to nothing. If you succeed, well.....It might be a strange observation to make from a movie about people serving life-terms in prison - but if you observe closely, the simple and most powerful message from 'The Shawshank Redemption' is this: 'Enjoy The Journey'.",1
"Throughout watching this movie (The Shawshank Redemption), I found it really enjoyable saying it wasn't my usual cup of my tea but I found it amazing.",1
"One of my all time favorite movies. Although there's not much action, the plot and acting pulled me in. Throughout the movie the suspense keeps building and building with everything happening to Andy you just feel bad for him. It all leads up to him escapping which he rightfully deserves to.Clearly Tim Robins was devoted to his role as Andy Dufresne. The way he stays in the same exact character through the whole movie is impressive. He always has a mild composure with little outbursts of anger and rage which I think he uses perfectly. Morgan Freeman as ""Red"" was impressive as always. Taking almost the mentor role for Andy to help him get through being in a jail until finally escapping.",1
"When I first caught Batman Begins 3 years back, I was awed by the way the movie was made. I went into the theater for the Dark Knight with high expectations and guess what........ it surpassed my expectations.Great script, great acting and most of all..... great show!! Christian Bale again shows that he was born to play the Batman.Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred Pennyworth.The late Heath Ledger gave an outstanding performance as the Joker. Won't give the plot away for those waiting to catch this but don't expect Ledger to be in the same league as Jack Nicholson. IMHO, I think he is way way ahead of old Jack in this performance. While the Joker in Batman(1989) was more of a clown, this joker is more of a ruthless criminal who plays mind games with the Dark Knight and Gotham Police Force.The search for a Harvey Dent was worth it. AAron Eckhart hits the nail on the coffin with his portrayal of Harvey Dent and his performance of Two-Face. Watching him will make viewers forget Tommy Lee Jones performance in Batman Forever. This Two-Face stays true to his origins. And also, great idea for the origins of Two-Face. At least, no acid being thrown in court.Overall, a show not to be missed. Can't wait for the DVD release.",1
"The movie was this one-of-a-kind, classy and amazing one!!! Anything to do with the brain I'm in and this Christopher Nolan movie was about crimes done by inducing dreams into people's heads and making them react a certain way?. Sheer brilliance!!!:) Jaw-dropping slow motion sequences and an unparalleled concept! Great work of editing and such success in getting such a complex idea into the layman's brains :) And Leonardo di Caprio is absolutely phenomenal and even better-it feels like heaven jus lookin at the guy!:) The movie did have its flaws? no take-away for life other than probably 'never stop imagining- sky's the limit- dream on'! and it was more of an intellectual and conceptual movie that highly successfully blew the head away, but failed to reach the heart? except probably the love between Caprio and Cotillard? so I don't see Oscars-even for a movie this phenomenal? somewhere down the line it 'failed' to get me clapping and cheering and also at the same time completely taking me over mind-&-soul like how a 'Gladiator', 'Forrest Gump', 'Finding Neverland', 'Beautiful Mind' or an 'Equilibrium' did? it jus took my 'mind'? in these ways I thought the movie was not wholesome for people of all ages to watch, and most importantly to 'cherish' for the rest of their lives? 'Inception' is amazing, aggressive, awesome smart artwork? but not the 'will-change-how-mankind-will-feel' kinds?.'just' brilliant, smart entertainment at a never-seen-before level of intellect. This is not just a 'gal's' way of saying, that no movie is good if not 'touching'? the only 'complaint/aching' is the under-utilization of a movie's immeasurable power/ability to, in 'many-other-ways' 'plant an idea/seed of thought' in a generation's hearts and 'not just the heads' :) talk about planting dreams in people's heads? not in reality something that will actually 'inspire' :)so not a perfect 10 for this one...",1
Love the action in this movie one of the greats. I still have the dvd of this movie.,1
Seen in the theater. Wonderful experience at Xiaoxitian.,1
"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.",1
"Wow what a classic....3 cheers for Chris Nolan....one exceptional director have loved all his movies from the movie following to TDK he has shown what a classics director he is for me he is gonna be the most exceptional storyteller of his time. Now abt he cast bale was effective,oldman was excellent,gwyenhall was OK better than Katie Holmes,Aaron was a revelation loved his make up as Two Face,Eric Roberts was strictly OK and Caine was as usual brilliant but the movie's centrifugal force was none other than the charismatic and super talented heath ledger.No one has portrayed a negative character with such determination and passion as ledger had done. this felt like more of a super villain movie rather than superhero. The story was marvellous the whole backdrop of Gotham was superb.no batman movie had portrayed Gotham in such a manner as Nolan has.Now why i think its the best superhero or to some point the best movie ever made is because of the simple fact that it shows heroes superheroes or normal heroes everyone have some weakness and no one is perfect.this shows that batman is not infallible does the people think so as the quote in the movies goes either you die as a hero or live long enough to see yourself as the villain. this superhero movies shoes the real emotions of a man n how often he is misunderstood by general people. the message is clear some people think abt their immediate people and some people think abt the whole mankind and those people who think abt the whole of mankind are the real superheroes and TDK aka the batman is a real super hero and unlike most of the other superheroes we can see that batman has no jurdiction. Hand up to NOLAN, BALE,OLDMAN AND the ledger hope u win an Oscar fr ur effort.",1
"""The Dark Knight"" which is the sequel to Christopher Nolan's 2005 ""Batman Begins"" clearly without question is a much better film as it goes deeper into the dark mind of both the superhero(""Batman"") and the villain(""The Joker""). The action and drama in the film is nonstop and you as the viewer will find it interesting and exciting. Yet most of all as I just mentioned unlike many comic book films of the past which have been kids stuff this is a film that shows the darkness of human nature proving that good and evil are just a short distance away from one another.When you have such great talent on a set like Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, Caine, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal with the serious psychological direction you clearly know that a film of this type is out to prove that it's fun and full of character struggles with all of it boiling to epic showdowns. Nolan makes the film very lengthy to try and wrap it all together, yet as bat fans know no matter how much you try to get across this saga will always be an epic that continues really my only negative of the film was the long length. As for everything else I loved the way that Nolan explored the conflict and dark minds of both ""Batman"" and the ""Joker"". Plus his subplot that involved the ""Harvey Dent"" character and for his new approach of how the creation of ""Two-Face"" became was interesting and neat.You find Gotham the same only this time ""The Joker""(Heath Ledger)is robbing banks in the city, yet his main plan is to overthrow and control all of the city's underworld workings. Here we find ""The Joker"" shown in a much different form than in the past. This is an evil villain with smeared makeup who was deeply hurt by his father and it was different seeing the clown prince having a weapons choice of a knife. Ledger takes the character to new psychotic heights in fact this performance from him rivals more like a turn to the ""Alex"" character in a ""Clockwork Orange"". I still favor the 1989 performance from legendary great Jack Nicholson who took the ""Joker"" role over the top with a mixture of camp and humor that still lead to majestic vanity, yet still this crazy freak turn from Ledger was great work for the way he did it with such maniacal grace. Heath certainly saved his best performance for last.Bale is once again in top form as ""Batman"" who yet again is a conflicted man trying to clean up Gotham even though an element of camp is shown in the film when it shows the city is running with copycat ""Batmans"". The love interest is still Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal who's a big upgrade over Katie Holmes)only the moonlight shift has caused a break in the romance so Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart)moves in to steal both types of thunder first the romancing of Rachel then he's out to shine as the city's crime fighting DA. Underneath all the conflict and drama the best man to see thru the corruption in the complex world is Lt. James Gordon(Gary Oldman). During all the drama and action and corruption the subplot and twist of Dent becoming ""Two-Face"" happens quickly which wasn't really necessary as this film's central theme is a hero who has to battle with darkness in his own mind and heart.So overall what more can I say on many levels this is the best ""Batman"" movie ever made. As Nolan clearly accomplished a lot with his direction of showing how even a hero can be very conflicted and complicated yet still must fight the darkness and be the heart that shines for justice and protection against evil and corruption. Sadly it's a shame that Ledger didn't live to see this work of success in which he as a dark wild card character helped blaze the film to a glorious victory. Heath's performance is one of the best in film history, and ""The Dark Knight"" in my opinion is one of the greatest films ever made.",1
One of the best superhero movies and one of the best movies in general. It is a must watch.,1
"Regardless of your thoughts concerning the lack of character development, the seemingly conformist message (for lack of a better term)and other various imperfections, this movie goes above and beyond.From a pure film making standpoint, it's a masterpiece. The story is fast paced enough, even for a 2 hour and 30 minute film, to keep you interested and keep the movie going. The characters are interesting (at least most of them) and the acting is good enough to fill the holes.The presentation is extraordinary. The action is frantic. The multiple atmospheres are all gripping. The plot is enthralling.In conclusion, to keep this simple, this movie should be watched by anyone who appreciates film or is looking for a great movie to watch.",1
"I really liked this movie, which I just recently saw for the first time, strange indeed since it is more than 10 years old. It reminded me, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman classic.I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally much more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't match Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen - in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't give him the chance that Steve had.Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the ""original"" too, it's not old-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge differential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon.",1
"If I was asked about my favorite film, I would think for a rather long time about the answer. There are many well-rounded films that I enjoy, so choosing the best of them would be a complicated task. However, if I was asked about the films that I would name among the best, I would almost immediately recall ""The Shawshank Redemption""_a film proving that when a person has will power, a dream, and persistence, nothing is impossible.The film was released in 1994; it was directed by Frank Darabont, who is now one of my favorite directors (his ""Green Mile"" is also great). The main roles were played by Morgan Freeman (whose character, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, in this picture is a kind of secondary character, but as crucial for the plot as the main one) and Tim Robbins. It is necessary to mention that the film has been created according to the novel by Stephen King named ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption""; for me, almost all movies made after King's books are amazing (except, perhaps, ""The Shining,"" which is remarkable, in my opinion, only due to the performance of Jack Nicholson). Anyways, the film tells the story of an accountant named Andy Dufrene, whose wife had been found dead along with her lover. Andy was accused of a double murder and was sent to Shawshank_one of the most cruelest prisons in America.My first impression of the film was that I was watching a typical Hollywood drama. However, after a while, I felt intrigued because the film turned out to be not as glossy and sleek as typical mass culture products are. It was telling an uncompromising story of a person who was unfairly accused and put into circumstances that anybody would find terrible. However, Andy Dufrene not only managed to survive in prison, but also found inner strength to pursue his dream, which was rather a simple one: to become free and rich, and live in the Mexican town of Zihuatanejo. And he manages to reach his dream: in the end, Dufrene escapes from prison, and the final scene shows him driving a sports car along the seaside.What I liked most of all was the actors' performances. Every person participating in the film acted so realistically that sometimes it seems you are watching a documentary. Perhaps, this is due to the influence of the place where the film was made; all the shooting was done in Mansfield penal colony, Ohio. All the characters are convex and credible, and sometimes I noticed being sympathetic towards some of them (like Freeman's Ellis Redding, for example); but then I realized that I was watching a film about prison, and Redding in fact was convicted for a triple murder.One of the film's strongest scenes (and one of my favorite) is when the prison's warden is reported that Andy Dufrene's cell is empty: he goes there to check it out_and indeed, all he sees is a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. Angry and anxious, the warden throws one of Andy's belongings at the poster, and surprisingly manages to make a hole in it. After he hurriedly tears the poster off the wall, he sees a tunnel_the tunnel Andy had been digging for more than 20 years of his imprisonment with the help of a small rock ax. This was the second thing I liked about the movie_the idea that hope never dies, and that will power can make any path possible, and any choice correct.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a great film to watch; some might find it stressful, because in fact it is a serious drama that shows a lot of injustice, violence, and other discouraging scenes. But, all this is needed to show how a single man with a dream and strong character can withstand all his misfortunes and change any life circumstances for the better.",1
Dreams within dreams within dreams that make you wonder. Where do I sign up? The movie make you want to see how they can pull off what they did and it didn't disappoint. The ending makes the audience decide which is always a nice conversation starter and makes for a good discussion afterward.,1
"1. This movie at least attempted to be more than just a glorified cartoon -- by focusing on some exquisite moral choices/dilemmas, beauty/ugliness, loyalty/betrayal, etc. That is its main strength, IMO.2. This movie -- as others have pointed out already -- has SO MANY plot inconsistencies/totally unrealistic sequences (even for a fantasy flick), it falls BELOW cartoon-like in that regard. That is its main -- and most annoying -- weakness.As far as the acting goes -- the Joker clearly stole the show. But the problems weren't really with the acting -- they were with the totally unrealistic way the plot evolved. Way too many subplots; not enough glue holding the whole thing together.You have to give the director credit for trying to create something of epic proportions, but you also have to hold him accountable for failing to deliver on that potential.",1
"DiCaprio, a master at extracting secrets out of the minds of sleeping targets, accepts the assignment to plant an idea into someone's mind - a task he managed once before with disastrous results. The first forty-five minutes of Christopher Nolan's thriller are a riveting roller coaster ride of overboarding imagination. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its initial promise. A story that, at its core, is a dream taking place in a dream taking place in a dream taking place in a dream has limitless possibilities. And yet Nolan the writer provides Nolan the helmer with not an ounce of fresh ideas once the inception-mission is set into motion, surrendering to - and relying too heavily on - trite shoot-ups, car chases and explosions that can be found in every ho-hum action yarn. The final showdown is a kicker, though. After ""Revolutionary Road,"" ""Shutter Island"" and this project, DiCaprio should seriously think about a change of pace. By now, he can play this kind of character in his sleep...obviously. Academy Award winner Cotillard gets constantly reminded why she got the Oscar in the first place (it can't be that Nolan chose this particular song by accident), Ellen Page's wryness is always welcome, and Michael Caine is wasted in a throw-away role. Expert, mood setting score by Hans Zimmer. All in all, ""Inception"" is a good (and good looking) movie. Pity, it could have been a great one.",1
"I was shocked by the second time I watched
this movie, The first time I saw this movie, I was confused not knowing what was going on, after that I read the reviews, then I realized I should be watching this movie again, so I was shocked how this happened and I didn't notice. I'm going to talk about all things in this great movie and I hope I never forget anything. The great director ""David Fincher"" gave us a great anecdote with plot twist from the movie and storytelling was perfect with the script, the cinematography was absolutely amazing, the greatest soundtrack what can I say, wonderful music with scenes, the great acting by ""Brad Pitt"" and ""Edward Norton"", the Diaglogues was perfect I can quote From it, The twisted OMG what amazing it is, The ending was the answer for all of this. Finally I'm glad for everyone who worked in this masterpiece thank you all.",1
"With INCEPTION, Christopher Nolan proves once again that he is one of the greatest directors of our time. This is a complex, mind-bending and engaging story of dreams and the dangers they can present. It was an original script, written by Nolan ten years ago, then rewritten and worked on before shooting began. The result is a true cinematic experience.INCEPTION is the story of Dom Cobb, a master thief in the art of extracting secrets and ideas from people's sub-consciousness, and his search for a way home. Cobb is offered a job to plant an idea deep into the mind of Robert Fischer, the heir to a multi-billion dollar empire. In return, Cobb will be able to go home. Planting an idea is known as inception, the opposite of extraction, but pulling off inception is no easy job?Christopher Nolan manages to create something truly original with this movie. The acting is wonderful, visuals are outstanding and the story is complex and intelligent. Out of all movies released so far in 2010, there is not a shadow of a doubt that INCEPTION is the best one, and will remain at the top for the rest of the year. This one demands an Oscar or three. Highly recommended! And, did I mention how amazing Hans Zimmer's score is? Well, it is.",1
"I'll admit I was excited about it. I thought it would be good. But, would it be THAT good??? Happily, I can say yes!!! Believe the hype, this is an excellent movie with brilliant acting. I don't really need to tell you how wonderful Heath Ledger was as the Joker, if he doesn't win an academy award for this movie, he will definitely be nominated in my opinion. His Joker was scarily psychopathic, veering from engrossing when he spoke and laughed to plain scary as he carried out his plans. I couldn't wait for him to lurch back on the screen and steal each scene he was in. The other actors were brilliant - particularly Aaron Eckhardt who was completely convincing as Harvey Dent. His bravado and faith in his convictions shone through. The best thing for me about this movie is that it resonates with our world today. It is a gritty movie which dealt with issues like terrorism and anarchy within a jilted society. Timeless issues really. Superhero movies are fun and action packed but, this transgresses from the traditional superhero genre to create a relevant story. The reasons for Batman's and the criminals actions were somewhat justifiable... and there isn't always a happy ending. This is the first time I have watched a movie and as the credits rolled at the end have said ""I'd come back and watch it again next weekend"". It IS that good.",1
"The actors, story, cinematography everything is at his best! How real Christopher Nolan made this world seem is just briljant.",1
"I thought this movie was extremely well done. Heath Ledger was astounding as the Joker. One of the Best Batman films so far. It was smart to include Two-Face to the plot. The fact that the White Knight of Gothem turned against good after his love died was genius on behalf of the Joker. I also thought that Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman were very good in the movie too. I also really liked the Joker's stories of how he got his scars and found them very chilling and the way the Joker licked his lips in a very intense way was amazingly done by Heath Ledger (R.I.P). I thought the conclusion statement made by Gordon (Gary Oldman) was the perfect way to end the film. In a nutshell I thought this movie was well done, intense and extremely enjoyable. Great movie over all. Enjoyed thoroughly! On the edge of my seat the entire time.",1
"I am very fond of Christian Bale's roles and DC Comics, so this film is perfect for me.",1
"Fight Club is the most original, idealistic movie of the 21st century thus far.  The acting is well-played and honest to human emotion.  The story is insightful and flows well.  This movie put Brad Pitt and Edward Norton on my favorite actor list which includes the likes of Tom Hanks, Kevin Spacey, and Denzel Washington.  See this movie if you need a cool story of human insanity, enlightenment, and self expression.  It won't let you down!  The script of this movie is literature.  I give it a ten, because you know a movie's good when you can watch it over and over again without noticing how bad your ass hurts from sitting to long.",1
You should watch it few times to compeletly understand it.,1
"I actually can't believe that people hate or even dislike this film, because for me it's one of the best of all time!! I think this film is very clever and is full of some brilliant and pitch black comic moments(Like when the guy trys to start a fight with a priest!!) The acting in this film is nothing short of outstanding, Norton is excellent and Pitt delivers a 5 star preformance!!So take it from me, check this film out!!!",1
Its kinda overrated but its still a very good movie,1
"Blew me away actually, very original (-planting an idea in someone's subconscious while they sleep) takes place, and tries to get the absolute most out of the story, action and graphics within the rules it created for itself for this inception to take place.Even though I found the movie very entertaining, in the end I felt it left me hanging. This was because the movie kept telling me over and over again how brilliant it was, and how superbly complex it was, while in fact, it wasn't complex at all. The basic story is very simple actually. It's just made complex with a lot of gimmicks.This isn't really a bad thing, all movies do it. So I wondered whether 'feeling conned' is a good argument. I guess it mainly had to do with the ending of the movie. The ending is a cheap way to have your audience question whether it was real or not. Of course, there is no correct answer. And that's OK. But why ask the question than? If it all wás real in end, the movie is that much better. Now they choose to be oh so 'deep' and 'thoughtful'. Where yet again, it really is not.I guess the 'feeling conned' sentiment comes from all the 'this movie is oh so complex, oh so deep, oh so thoughtful' gestures it makes. But it fails to deliver actual arguments (for me at least)to back that claim up. The gimmicks are (needlessly) complex indeed, the basic story itself is not, not by a long shot.This all sounds very negative, and the movie doesn't deserve it, it's a very good movie and to all the people I know I recommended watching it. Mainly because it spawned interesting conversations. However, that bitter after-taste of 'feeling conned' has made me come to feel this is a movie without heart. To me it seems they didn't want to make this movie so 'complex' and 'deep' because they loved doing so or because the story deserved it. They only did it to try and trick me to think this was a brilliant movie. And when you try to do that with me, I tend to back away.",1
"This movie is amazing. I life my life by the premise of this movie. The takeaway from this film is something every US citizen should watch especially in this century as the media consumes our culture. You might ask yourself what your watching for a good portion of the movie, but in a good way. It all pieces together in the end. I highly recommend watching this twice just because... well.. you'll understand at the end. It's one of those movies where you need to watch it twice to catch the subtleties.",1
"As much as I can't deny that in more recent viewings, Inception hasn't wowed me as much as the first time (but then again few movies do). Still, in one of my latest revisits, the movie continues to grab my full attention whether it's with smartly written dialog or exciting action scenes. Plus I still believe that DiCaprio deserved a bit more recognition in his role as it's one of great emotional depth.So in Inception we are introduced to a world in which dream-sharing is possible and procedures like extraction are the norm in the espionage game. Cobb (DiCaprio) seems to be the biggest player, but now he is faced with a choice, as a wealthy energy mogul named Saito (Watanabe) promises him an opportunity to stop running and go back home to the U.S. The catch? He must perform Inception on the subject, or in more known terms, implant an idea in the subconscious. Christopher Nolan has directed one the best movies of the genre for me. A complex idea that is shown to the audience by fantastic visuals and asks some pertinent questions, Inception allows you to be entertained but also mentally aware of what's going on. It is a blockbuster movie, there's no question there. However it's one that offers a unique story that plays out at a fast pace and with ideas that will certainly be discussed after the movie finishes.Inception is without a doubt still a great movie. It's been 4 years since its release, so understandably the hype has died down, as has the discussion of the movie's plot. Some of us still love it, others have been let down in repeat viewings, while some still claim the movie is flawed and not smart. Personally I believe it's a masterpiece within the genre. As a general movie? Well that's a discussion for another time. My final advice is whether you end up liking it not, do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you still haven't. It's unmissable.Rating: 10/10",1
"I hadn't seen this film until today and I never would have rented it if I hadn't seen that it was so high up on the top 250. It wouldn't have been a great loss. It's a pretty good movie, but a bit sappy for my taste. Gives you lots of warm feelings inside about persistence through adversity, hope, friendship and all that good stuff. If you're into that, it is very well put together and it features some good acting and a beautiful score. Oh, and -- this could be considered a SPOILER given that it's a prison movie -- the ending is so nice and so predictable and so cute and so corny, it just hurts. Art, it is not.",1
"Firstly I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.The Shawshank Redemption is a perfectly woven, superbly performed, and flawlessly shot cinematic masterpiece that is sure to never be forgotten. Along with Darabont's other prison outing, The Green Mile, he has crafted a pair of subtly affecting dramas with real heart. Shawshank, however takes the prize. Phenomenal stuff. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy living' or get busy dying'.""The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?",1
"This movie gave me all I ever expected of a movie. Interesting story with interesting actors. Some action, some tragedy. However some people criticize it for some lacks in the story I think the perfect work that David Fincher has done makes me to forget about those lacks.",1
"I could use words like ""epic"", ""a masterpiece"", ""brilliant"", or several other clichés to describe this movie (I guess I just did), however one indication that a movie transcends to a level that cannot merely be defined in words is when it simply sticks with you.The Dark Knight sticks with you.A day after seeing Christopher Nolan's second installment in the ""Batman"" franchise, I find my mind wandering to various scenes and events in the picture that literally affected my subconscious. It is truly rare when a film can generate that kind of immersion... but this is one of those examples.As many other commenter's have mentioned, the cast all deliver excellent performances. I will also concede that Heath Ledger is indeed phenomenal as The Joker. However, the one performance that will likely get a fraction of the recognition it deserves is Aaron Eckhart at Harvey Dent/Two-Face. By comparison, Ledger's character intentionally has very little depth; we get no back story on the Joker's origins, nor any explanation of his motivations... but that was the point. The Joker represents chaos and anarchy, a soulless psychopath who just wants to ""watch the world burn."" From that perspective, it works very well. Eckhart, on the other hand, had the remarkable task of playing a character that starts out as ""Gotham's White Knight"", but slowly descends into a character full of hatred and vengeance because of the terrible tragedy that he endured. All the while sharing the screen with a Gotham villain that, by nature, ""steals the show"". Unlike the Joker, you can truly empathize with Harvey Dent's motivations... he is horrifying, yet draws a great deal of sympathy. Dent is the quintessential tragic hero, and Eckhart completely pulls it off. The real clincher, though, was the absolutely fantastic makeup/CG for Two-Face. I can say without exaggeration, that it is both shockingly haunting and believable at the same time... which is likely why that image still lingers in the back of my mind.As a whole though, The Dark Knight pulls you in and never lets go. Perhaps it is fitting that Nolan chose not to include ""Batman"" in the title, because this movie could have functioned even without such a well-known protagonist. It is more a crime drama with DC characters injected into it, than a story built entirely around them. That's not to say that the characters take a back seat, however their personality traits and origins serve as inspiration for something even larger.The Dark Knight puts Christopher Nolan among Hollywood's most elite directors. Dare I say it; he may have even undone the seemingly reputable damage to the ""Batman"" name that ""Batman and Robin"" caused. Forget those other movies, Nolan's Batman will be the one to remember.",1
"Fight Club made me think, and it did it whilst telling an engrossing story that wasn't patronising, like other films that want to make you ""think"". By the end of this film I felt fulfilled but also that there was an innate problem in society that needs to be fixed. This film made me want to eat the rich. I also thought that the perspective was really interesting and having to question what I was seeing was really fun.",1

Summary: A Man is asked to do the impossible.He is supposed to plant an idea in someones mind while In a shared dream. A dream requires a architect and a subject but can have more than two people in it. To get out of it you have to die or have a kick. A kick is a fall or a dunk. Recommendation: I think overall it is a good action packed movie but don't get until you watch it again. Analysis: lighting. The very beginning music builds rapidly on a black screen and then Bam! You have ocean waves roaring. This is the first thing they do that grabs your attention instantly. after That a man appears dressed in black lying face down on the shore. Then a guard appears with a gun poking him with it. the shot has the camera low looking up to dark uniformed guard with the sun above his head. This makes him look in control and in the position of power. Next they show a Chinese or Japanese building. then they show him being dragged into a dark room helplessly. The dark lighting with the sound effect give you a chill down your back and gets you curious. throughout the beginning his face is half covered in shadow. the darkness just builds curiosity and gives you a nervous feeling. But later it shows how gloomy Cobb is. (Cobb is the main character) It shows how hard his life is but still gives intensity when needed.,1
"From the intro setting up the mood for the 1940s with If I didn't Care that strangely feels like Bioshock or Fallout from the other era defining themes such as the relevance of Rita Haywood from the 50s to Tommy Williams emulating the James Dean Rock' n Roll character to set the mood of the 60s. This is something that has not been addressed when reviewing this movie, how it seamlessly transfer from era to era is genius in itself. The camaraderie between Andy and Red is flawless and the viewer truly believes that these two are the leaders of Shawshank and are the best of friends. By leaders, just look at the scene where Heywood is about to be slit by Brooks and Andy and Red are notified right away to solve the problem; great scene symbolizing their importance to the group. The only flaw which keeps it from being a perfect 10 out 10 movie is that it suffers from the same stereotype that prison movies are littered with, and that is the inclusion of sodomites. I know that's what happens in prisons, but is just disgusting and cringe worthy seeing this on screen; however Shawshank Redemption implies what the Sisters do to Andy and never graphically show it on screen and that is the saving grace. That is why it only loses one point and not several, anyhow. The movie's message about hope is more heavily implied near the end though, how Andy never loses hope while Red is closer to being institutionalized. The line get busy living or get busy dying always sends chills down my spine because of its relevance when Andy says it when he knows that the system is absolutely corrupt when his only witness that could get him a new trial is killed so that Andy could keep laundering money for the warden.",1
"I'm the 2436th person to review this movie. I first saw this movie on TV while at a girl's house I was dating. I came in at about 30 minutes into the movie but I was truly captivated by the movie and I never forgot it. More than 15 years later I saw it on DVD uncut and I liked it even more. Some things I'd forgotten about from the last time I had seen it. But one thing I will never forget is the brutality of that lead guard, played by Clancy Brown. This was a movie that wanted me to abolish maximum security prisons! The violence, the rape the intimidation the corruption! It didn't start with Attica (See My Review Of Against The Wall) but has been in existence since America's founding.Tim Robbin's character had the worst luck of anyone in the world! He was at the crime scene but did not go into the room where his wife was cheating on him. He left bullets behind and then stupidly threw his gone into the river only to not have it be discovered. Had he kept his gun the ballistics would have proved that his gun was not the murder weapon. As it stands another killer did the murder and in essence got away with the crime. This led to Andy's (Robbin's Character) being convicted for a crime he did not commit.I was amazed at the inner strength that Robbin's character Andy had. He was beaten, humiliated, raped and yet was able to still persevere without losing his mind. But that's what he had in abundance. He had a mind and he used it to outwit his enemies and friends too. In many ways his escape reminded me of the two fellows who escaped from prison a few months ago in New York. It was a tenacious desire to get one's freedom from the oppression of the Man! This is why I admired Tim Robbins and his character, Andy.Redd was portrayed so well by Morgan Freeman that the story might just as well have been about him too. I'm glad that Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford were not cast in these roles. The film would have suffered I'm sure. But I will say this, the film might have done better at the box office had the title been different. Shawshank Redemption is not really a catchy title and may have turned women and some men off entirely to seeing the film. This is what at least one writer said. Despite this I give the film Four and a Half Stars. Leonard Maltin gave it Two and a Half out of Four Stars. I disagree with that but he may have been turned off by the length of the film.The author Robert A. Berman in his fantastic book Fade In: The Screen writing Process said something interesting. He said that he had read an article about films with bad titles. He said that almost every badly titled film did poorly at the box office. ""The Shawshank Redemption, which did okay in theatres, might have done more business with a better title. I passed on seeing The Shawshank Redemption in the theatres. The title just turned me off."" He went on to say that he saw it on Pay-For-View and liked it while adding that a good title can make a difference in box office sales. I concur with this observation. The title of this movie is nothing to write home about. This may have explained its average showing at the box office. Despite this, don't hold back from seeing this fine film. It's a true gem!",1
The subtle yet in your face message about consumerism and conformity plays an interesting and compelling game that will stand the test of time.,1

"Every once in a while, the giant Hollywood production companies manage to produce something beyond a box office , money making, trend setting and ""watch me everybody"" movie - they produce a piece of art. And if this piece of art can speak to people openly, if it can make them think freely and create a emotional turn-on every single time their senses unite with it, it becomes a Cult. How else can you describe Fight Club but a cult movie? I got one - a cry for revolution movie. It goes in open war with everything we accept for a material reality. It FIGHTS the big lie of the modern society that is all around us. It hates every single cell of the organism of todays life - even itself ( a hit motion picture). Yeah, my friends, prepare for the fight, it is about to begin.How do you start a revolution? You begin with yourself - you must free yourself first. You must lose the chains and get back to the origin , to your nature. Then you find out that other people feel exactly the same. Their energy is also spent on things that are not important, day after day. They too , deep inside, have the urge to FIGHT. They , however , do not know how to define this instinct , the burning sensation in every single molecule of their bodies. You teach them, help them to break free and then lead them. Where? To anarchy? No. To God. To the place they want to be. To the higher source of energy that the human being can become one with. Forget about everything you now think is a priority. It is not. Come on , it is not that hard. Just close your eyes. Do you feel angry? Think you are waisting your life , and I mean every second of it? Something tells you that this can be it, I can spend the rest of my life like this? I know you do. One of the greatest powers of the man is the ability to make a choice. Make yours. This movie does not suggest you should go out and fight other people, you know that. It suggest you to FIGHT, and fight your way. Wake up, go out and fight. Join the revolution. Open your mind and think. After all , it is your life. Start living it. Your way.",1
"Heath Ledger is incredible in this movie... He made the joker the world's most iconic ,great supervillain of all time... No one can present the character of joker as great as Ledger. He is Perfect!!! Within a limited screen time Ledger attracted all the attention to him. It's a legendary acting",1
Loved it sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much......................,1
"I went to see The Dark Knight yesterday. My expectations were rather high after reading the usercomments and ratings at IMDb. But movie did not even get close to the sky high ratings it has been awarded. Shortly described - the Joker character, played by deceased Heath Ledger is acting at is best. No doubt about that. BUT the rest of the movie, the plot etc. is only average and what you could expect. I went to a mid-day play and halfway through the movie i was almost about to catch a nap.. i was NOT especially tired when entering the cinema. When people are talking about a world class movie here, they are way wrong!! I could mention a bunch of way better movies but if you expect to go watch a good/average action based movie which is 30 min too long and if you are well rested - then go see The Dark Knight. (I am not a lonely wolf on this one as 4 of my friends who went to see it afterwards, totally agrees with me) 6/10 nothing more!! - go see for yourself.",1
"While just as silly and more or less pointless as his earlier flicks, Nolan has created in Inception a decent enough heist movie. Just think of it as a movie about a multi-layered holodeck program, however, designed by programmers familiar with Counter Strike, cinematography, and disaster movies, since the idea of dreams in this film is quite banal and undreamlike, really - they are capitalist espionage tools with all the subconscious removed, or rather, translated into what is familiar to Nolan - a kind of Michael Bay alternate reality. The story, touted as complex, is complex only on the level that it is a heist movie - a fairly straightforward and very linear heist movie. There's no psychology (one character's statement that ""it's all about X"" is the entire psychological content of the film - the oldest trope in the book becomes a single, meaningless line) philosophy, ethics, and certainly no spirituality involved. I've seen some making comparisons to Solaris, either Tarkovsky's or Soderburgh's, but these are specious comparisons, made in a desperate attempt to elevate Nolan's vacant shenanigans. Don't believe it. The film is a hoax. It's fun, but it's a hoax. Nolan's characters are all self-centered and only speak the technobabble or reductionist claptrap Nolan forces into their mouths, there's not a shred of intellect anywhere.One step above a Michael Bay creation, and that's it.",1
"This is one of those rare movies where the movie is as good as the book. Yes, it's on all the time on TBS and you have probably seen half of the movie part of the way through but in order to really realize it's greatness, you have to watch the entire thing. Stephen King is known for making so many books into movies but after being a fan of his for over 25 years, only a few of his have really translated to really great movies (The Green Mile, etc) like this one has. It is one of those movies that started out slow but has gained momentum over the years. The reason it has do so is it's pacing and great storytelling. With great story has come this great movie. I thank so many people for getting it made and thank so many people for making it so great. Thank you.",1
"""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club""I will go ahead and break the rule and simply talk about Fight Club; the 1999 film that I recently added to my favorite movie list. In my opinion this is one of Fincher's masterpieces along with Se7en. David Fincher has made some great films, but none have ever rivaled his work in the 90's with these two films. Both Se7en and Fight Club are among my favorite films and consider them superior to Fincher's other great recent films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Social Network, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Fight Club is an extremely violent film, but I don't think it's gratuitous because the movie really works as a satire and raises several philosophical questions about how enslaved we've become under the capitalist and advertising system, but it also points out the danger of anarchy as well. We've become materialist beings finding our purpose in our possessions and have left out the spiritual part. Sometimes we need to feel pain to remind ourselves that we are alive, and in a way this film works as a highly crafted metaphor. I loved the way the story was presented and how this surrealistic film worked. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls, Fight Club is a masterpiece thanks to Fincher's direction and the performance from the excellent cast which includes Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter. I really loved this movie from beginning to end, including the twist in the final act. 1999 was the year of great twists considering this is when The Sixth Sense was released as well (my all time favorite film). Fight Club is a must see film for all.The movie begins with a scene where the narrator (Edward Norton) has a gun forced down his throat by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), to which the narrator begins to tell the viewer what has led him to this point through voice over narration, and so the film is told in flashback. He takes us back to the days when he was an office worker who experienced severe insomniac problems. The doctor recommended that he visit a support group with men who have suffered from testicular cancer in order for him to really see the pain other people have gone through. Despite not suffering from this condition, the narrator decides to do so and discovers that going to these therapies allows him to finally being able to sleep for the first time in months. After this, he decides to attend a different support group every night and everything seems to go well, until he discovers a manic depressive woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who is doing the same thing he's been doing: jumping from one support group to another. Seeing her as an intruder and a liar, the narrator can no longer find peace in the support groups and so his insomniac problems begin again. His life will change dramatically when he meets Tyler Durden, a soap maker, in an airplane and has an interesting conversation with him. They exchange numbers and when the narrator arrives home from the airport he discovers his condo has been blown up. He then decides to call Tyler and ends up moving in with him at an old abandoned complex. The two start a very different support group which they call Fight Club since they have to fight one another. The movement becomes popular and little by little they begin to form a revolutionary movement known as Project Mayhem, but things begin to escalate too fast and dangerously. Edward Norton appeared in the big movie screen during the 90's and this was when he made his best films (American History X, Primal Fear, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Rounders, and Fight Club), although I would have to argue that his best performances were in American History X and The 25th Hour. However he is still excellent in this film as well. Brad Pitt is at his best playing the sort of chaotic and anarchic character who in some ways is similar to the narrator, but in others very different and more dangerous. He has a strong pull on Norton's character and influences him deeply. Helena Bonham Carter also plays one of her best roles as this sort of manic-depressive character who stands her own ground in this mostly male dominated film. The performance from the cast is one of the best things about Fight Club which works in every level. The visuals and special effects are also fantastic. It is a dark film with a lot of violence mixed with satire that had me laughing quite a bit. I absolutely loved this movie and the ending was just brilliant.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",1

Excellent movie with suspense script writing is very good in whole movie they keep our minds in deep thinking of dreams Christopher nolan is excellent,1
truly one of the best movie i have ever seen.....the acting of Morgan freeman is outstanding as it always is....also Tim Robbins has done nice work......the plot of the movie is very enjoying and won't let you get sleepy..the movie is very much interesting at all times and most of the time you cant predict what's going to happen...also the cast of the movie is very appropriate.when i watched the movie i was truly amazed by the story and no matter its the best movie of all time....also the direction of Frank Darabont is really worth appreciating...as his direction made the movie really awesome...the movie again is truly worth watching....i enjoyed watching this movie and hope you guys enjoy it too....,1
"In my opinion this movie is the best Christopher Nolan has directed - This movie is better than The Dark Knight in my opinion.I didn't think that any movie that Nolan would direct after The Dark Knight would get any better but it outshone it by 20 times.When I went to see this movie I definitely wasn't disappointed with it.Nolan is one of the best directors ever. I do believe without a doubt this is Nolan's masterpiece and any future movie from Nolan will be very difficult to do better than this one.It reminded me of the Matrix but much better with a mix of James Bond.It is very hard to understand unless you pay very close attention to the movie(It is very hard to describe what this movie is about), the plot was very good and had a very good concept,Leonardo DiCaprio had an amazing performance which is very worthy of Best Actor Academy Award and everyone else in the movie did almost as well.The soundtrack in the movie was breathtaking.It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen next.It was interesting and imaginative.The movie did very well in every part and has all the elements required to earn Best Picture at the 2011 Academy Awards and other awards, I think that not only is this the best movie of 2010 it is probably the best movie of the 2010 decade.If you haven't seen this movie yet you MUST see it.It is well worth the money.10/10 is my rating",1
"So yeah this is probably the best movie ive ever seen in my life. Its brilliantly shot(roger deacons of course) magnificently scored, perfectly acted by the entire cast,heart warming,heart breaking and uplifting in equal measure. Its a classic for a damn good reason and I hope it gets a 4k release for its 25th aniversery.",1
"I am surprised to read that so many people think that this is a fabulous masterpiece. It is better than most superhero films, but that isn't saying much. Christian Bale is quite bland as Bruce Wayne, and a bit over the top as Batman. The film never gets to grips with how he behaves as Bruce Wayne, either in public or in private. It is interesting that he is never shown enjoying his wealth, but nothing much is made of this.Whereas ""Batman Begins"" was good in that it went to some trouble to explain how Batman could get hold of his astonishingly high-tech gadgets and vehicles, in this film we are required to believe that he makes some stupendous gadgets himself, very quickly, using his development company, but without its knowing. There are some rather improbable rooms that such things happen in, too. Be realistic or be stylised and fantastic - make your mind up. Similarly, decide whether Batman is a human, with the abilities of a human, or some super-human, but this film keeps trying to have it both ways.Heath Ledger is indeed good as The Joker, although really any actor worth his salt should have been pretty good in this gift of a role.The casting of the love interest was bizarre. We have to believe that Gotham's two most eligible bachelors are both dotty over her, and the dialogue keeps saying that she is amazingly beautiful, but the actress cast is fairly ordinary-looking, and the script writers never give her anything to do or say to make her adorable.One major criticism I have of the film is that Gotham City, which we are told is forever poisoned by corruption, looks so nice. The buildings are all well built and maintained. The streets are sunny, well laid out and litter-free. The city is clearly prosperous and well-run. There are several hospitals, all clean and with good equipment. Whenever the city has to organise anything, all the various employees of the city spring into action efficiently and things happen, again and again.The next big criticism is that the film is FAR too long. It appears to come to conclusion, and then keeps going, with twist after twist, each more improbable than the last. Whereas the film works pretty well as thriller for the first half, the endings strain credulity and patience. The Joker is able to place bomb after bomb in all the right places without anyone's suspecting, and the police's actions get more and more stupid.I'm hoping that The Watchmen will blow this away.",1
This is the bast movie I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face.This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy Villain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's ""White Knight"" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.",1
"It is always fun to read the 1 out of 10 star reviews on a movie like this. A quarter million IMDb reviewers found this film to be near the best a movie can be and 80% of top critics on RottenTomatoes thought it was good. This being the internet, the next step is for the contrarians to pop out from under their troll bridges and explain why it is actually the worst thing ever made. Really? The acting is one star, the story is one star, the dialogue is one star, the special effects are one star and the overall movie worse than, say, Glitter? Someone even had to post that he is in Mensa and he is smart enough to know that this movie is stupid. Let me quickly say that I feel most people would enjoy the mixture of action, emotion and brain tease that Inception delivers. It is a very solidly built piece of entertainment. The music can be a bit overwhelming and there is a bit too much exposition but otherwise this is a very engaging and clever movie with enough emotional moments to make you care about the action. It solidly deserves a place in the top 250 which has great movies listed despite the constant gripes that it is filled with summer blockbusters and pop fluff.In response to some of the main critiques that the geniuses have posited:""Dreams don't work like that - all SMART people know this."" - it is made pretty clear during the movie that these dreams are chemically controlled to induce certain levels of sleep depending on the chemist's concoctions. This allows Nolan to give his movie a set of rules that are a bit more hardline than actual dreams. He has also introduced an architect to control things. So, yes, it isn't as dreamlike as other dream movies because we are being guided by drugs, an architect, and a team of dream manipulators. ""Nothing matters because it is all a dream."" - nothing matters in life because we are all going to die and the sun will explode and erase everything that ever was. Cobb's battles with his demons and the threat of being trapped in a hellish mental limbo are real whether the whole thing was a dream or not.""There is no there there."" - knowing this line and repeating it doesn't make your argument any more valid than the overused ""jumped the shark"" quote. Obviously not every movie will be liked by every person but it is hard to believe that this movie that has so many well-crafted aspects could honestly be deserving of one star.",1
The best film. I recommend every pouch to watch . Tom Hardi best actor.,1
"First of all, this movie has a pretty good cast. It's a shame that Freeman and Oldman have such small roles because Christian Bale as Batman would be as forgettable as the usher if his voice wasn't so stupid. The joker was indeed played excellently by Ledger which saves this film from absolute mediocrity, but I can't understand why the performance could deserve an Oscar. He just plays a crazy guy well. His character lacks any other emotions or motivations. The effects and gadgets are very impressive, if not a bit ridiculous at times, but it's a comic book movie and I wasn't hoping for realism. The plot is a bit messy and dragged out but overall quite good. I felt like two face was created rather inexplicably and was killed off too soon. Ranked the best movie EVER at present?! Not by a long shot. I didn't leave the cinema feeling moved, thoughtful or blown away. It was just a decent action film.",1
The music department did a great job! Did not disappoint!,1
"Inception Nolans latest effort is a cleverly constructed and beautifully executed sci-fi thriller, apparently he first pitched the idea to WB in 2003 and then went away to write a script he thought would be finished in a few months, 8 years later the film is released and it's no wonder it took so long to complete. The film follows Cobb (Leonadro Di Caprio), who specialises in entering people's dreams and stealing valuable secrets his employers. We open with Cobb in the mind of Saito(Ken Watanabe); a business tycoon he needs to retrieve secret documents from, but things go horribly wrong when the subconscious projection of his former wife enters the dream and betrays him. Cobb and his partner Arthur (Joseph-Gordon Levitt) are forced to flee the country as their employers will not tolerate failure, but Saito tracks them down and makes them an offer; Inception. If they can successfully plant an idea into the mind of one of Saitos competitors Saito will pull the strings necessary to grant Cobb the freedom to go back to America and see his kids again. Cobbs team is consists of Arthur, Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), Eames (Tom Hardy), Adriadne the architect (Ellen Page) who is responsible for creating the dream. Nolan not only manages to create a wonderful story, but also adds his own cyberpunk dialogue to the mix. 'Riding the kick', 'Totems', 'Projections', they all add substance to the world he has created. The origins of this technology are not explored, in fact it's more of an alternate reality than a story set in the future, but it's a world constructed with such attention to detail that it feels real. What follows is a complex but not overly contrived series of dreams within dreams in order to plant the idea deep enough for it to stick. It's a mixture of theft and business espionage that provides a setting for some wonderful visuals, and in the end the only limitation is the mind of Nolan himself. One scene where Arthur is fighting off the projections of the target inside a rotating corridor is thrilling to watch in all its nauseating vertigo, whilst Cobbs training of Adriadne provide the artistic license to pull a whole host of crazy special effects. Cities bend in half, mirrors smash and turn into streets, it's a world of unlimited potential. Di Caprio once again proves that he knows how to pick a movie, his Scorsese partnership rarely disappoints, but Nolan has provided the platform for another successful performance. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is able to play his role with both suave coolness and perfectly timed comedic relief, whilst Ellen Page uses her indie image to convey a female lead devoid of the usual stereotypes. The rest of the supporting cast all do a fine job, especially Cillian Murphy as the mind-invaded and emotionally manipulated target of the Inception.After watching this film I'm still convinced Nolan boasts a flawless oeuvre, every one demonstrates a clear talent for script-writing. Insomnia may be the weakest of them all and it will come as no surprise it's the only film he had no hand in writing in. Nolan however could not resist one final teaser to the audience with Inception. As the film concludes and we are left satisfied with the arc of our protagonist, the camera pans away on to the perpetually spinning totem. As it is about to topple the film cuts away, now I don't think Nolan is seriously trying to imply that Cobb is dreaming, instead I think it's his own clever Inception. To plant an idea into the minds of the audience and watch it grow.",1
"One of the greatest and true pieces of cinematic masterpiece. Shawshank will forever be in at least the top 25 movies to watch of all times. I can watch it over and over again and never tire from it.The Movie allows you to ponder the troubles in your own life, that no matter what problems, no matter what is bringing you down; as long as your mind stays strong then the skies the limit. Shawshank is not only a prison movie, but a movie about humanity and acceptance. Tim Robbins character is so smooth with out a care in the world, its if like prison life doesn't even phase him, but it just showed that no matter how he felt and how hard of a time this character suffered, he was in time befriended and accepted for who he is and how strong willed he proved to be.",1
"I chose this as the best film I'd ever seen for two reasons: the script and the acting, both of which are without peer. We've come to expect greatness from Edward Norton, who can make us gasp with the slightest change in the blood vessels of his eyeball, but Brad Pitt provides Norton with the perfect acting foil. This film demonstrates why Pitt needs better scripts, because it proves he is in the top tier of American actors. He needs to stop hanging around Clooney (although after ""Good Night and Good Luck"" we may all be rooting for Clooney to get writing and directing Oscars) and start seeking out non-genre scripts. Working together cemented a close friendship between Norton and Pitt -- it's a compliment to both to say that they deserve each other. The movie is hilarious and dead serious and a sharpshooter when it comes to urban male psychology. I'll bet you can't watch it just once! You'll want to watch it the second time with the subtitles on, just to make sure you get all the verbal sorcery. What great dialog! Some people are afraid of this movie because of the fight scenes, which are indeed realistic and bloody, but that commitment not to soften or dumb down the film is completely right and part of what makes this such an intelligent, watchable, and, finally, a ""moral"" film that occupies the ethical high ground without going anywhere near the pulpit. FIGHT CLUB is one of the high points of 20th century art.",1
"Comic book movies are all too often a little hard to take seriously. Their sources, comic books, keyword being ""comic"" gives them a spin that they are just entertainment. In fact, many are just that. Maybe even most of them. Even if they are good stories they almost always have that element of ridiculousness. A favorite comic book character of mine, The Punisher, was put to screen in 2004 with an unusually dark ""comic book"" movie, but it still had that air of it is just a movie. A dark and brutal one, but even the most die hard Punisher fan knows, his/her hero exists in a world other than ours despite the fact that he has no superpowers.Batman is slightly comparable to The Punisher in that he he has no superpowers, just his gear and brains. Admittedly Batman's gear is even more out of this world than the Punisher's, whose tools are just various weapons, and not custom made caves, hideouts and vehicles. However, Batman's appeal seems to be broader in that his story is broader. He isn't just one man out for vengeance due to a personal tragedy. He is a person who could easily live comfortably without risking his life, yet chooses to do so anyway. There is an inherent good that Batman possesses and it drives him to go above and beyond when he could just easily settle on a comfortable life. Batman as a comic book character, and especially in Christopher Nolan's rendition of him, has been elevated to an almost mythical status. He is obviously unreal, yet he rings true in more ways than one. Perhaps that is why Nolan chose to use Batman's nickname as the film's title, ""The Dark Knight"" as Batman is not a knight in shining armor, as the cliché goes, but a someone with a critical difference.""The Dark Knight"" perhaps constructs its greatest complexity by showing Batman not just as a realistic character with his own conflicts, but that society is conflicted about him. He isn't just Good. He is mostly Good, but part Ugly in his fight against the Bad that is equally impressively shown as The Joker. From The Joker's surprising introduction at the film's start to the end he wrecks hell and plunders for his own good, but he is far from the Black hat villain of old John Wayne westerns. A great scene, near the beginning is where The Joker sticks a pencil into a table and then ""makes it disappear."" That scene is a hilarious bit of dark humor and an act of savagery that bluntly sums him up. The chaos that The Joker causes affects everyone even causing some to ""turn to the dark side"" (pardon the cliché) but still in that complex manner that rings true and has not one bit of cheesiness in it.The action sequences in the film are nothing short of first rate. Limited and smart use of computer graphics and real explosions and car crashes. So even if the film is seen just for the action it works as a great movie. Contrary to many recent action film sequences these are simply superb and not a confusing mess of non-stop editing and noise.""The Dark Knight"" is a great film because it works on many levels, is so well constructed on many levels. It can be watched as a straightforward superhero/villain film or a symbolic representation of struggle in our ever growing and urbanizing world. It is a engrossing tragedy that shows a cruel world where not every good guy makes it to the end, but also largely uplifting at the same time. And, I'll say it once again, it rings true. --- 10/10BsCDb classification: 13+ --- violence",1
"In the coming paragraphs, I will try to lay down what I believe beyond doubt has happened in this movie, what was real and what was a dream, and in the course of doing so, I will unfold the reasons behind my beliefs. I' d be happy to discuss counter theories from Inception enthusiasts like myself.So, without over complicating things and talking about dreams within dreams within dreams, let me put down some basic principles: 1- A minute in our life is equivalent to almost 10 minutes in the first level of dream which is equal to probably a 100 minute in the third level of the dream and so on. Bottom line: the more levels down of a dream one is in, time extends to hours and weeks and years. Remember, Cobb and Mal were sleeping in their house while doing the experiment for a couple of hours and in their dream, they lived over 50 years.2- If someone dies in a dream, s/he wakes up immediately. However, if they were heavily sedated and are in several dreams within dreams, they are lost in Limbo. Limbo is an expanse of infinite raw subconscious. It is the deepest anyone can travel into the mind and the person will not know they are in Limbo nor that they are dreaming.Now that the above is established, here is what happened: 1- Cobb is truly unable to go to his country because he is accused of murdering his wife. He believes that Saito's proposal is the only way for him to be with his children again.2- Cobb accepts the job and the part in Mombasa and the airplane are all true.3- Saito gets shot in the first level of the dream and they fear he will go into Limbo in which case he will not honor the agreement with Cobb simply because he would forget when he wakes up everything that happened prior to him getting on the plane.4- The team continues in the dream traveling till we see Saito dead in the ice stage.5- Ariadne and Cobb decide to go to Limbo to get Fisher and Saito.6- Ariadne brings Fisher back and Cobb goes to look for Saito.Now, the part where the movie starts, Cobb on a deserted shore and some security people taking him to an old man is actually Cobb dreaming in Limbo. Cobb knows that Saito is dead and is now in Limbo. He wants to go bring him back but remind him to honor his promise. If Saito forgets everything else, he should not forget to make the phone call that he promised to make. Otherwise, Cobb lands in the airport and will be forever prisoned for murdering his wife.Cobb meets Saito, the old man and reminds him of their agreement. The question is: why is Saito so old and Cobb is still young? Cobb knew that Saito died and hence dropped in Limbo. The long minutes that passed from Saito dying after throwing the bomb at the projections in the ice field and Cobb and the others discussed what is to be done, these few minutes are years and years in Limbo. Remember what I mentioned above about the experiment Cobb and Mal did. They only stayed dreaming for possibly an hour or two, but they lived over 50 years in Limbo. This explains why Saito has aged so much while Cobb is still a young man.Everyone wakes up in the plane and starting this point in the movie everything is real again. It is clear that Saito doesn't quite know what's happening. Possibly he lost a big part of his mind while in Limbo but we know one thing when he picks up the plane phone: he remembers he has to make this phone call. The phone call is made and Cobb passes through immigration with no trouble. His father meets him and takes him back home.A lot of controversy that revolved around this last scene is because of the totem spinning. People say, the totem didn't stop spinning, therefore, Cobb is still dreaming. They also say that the children didn't age and they were wearing the same clothes as they wore in his dreams. In fact, if you see the movie three times like me, you will know that the children clothes did change. I am sure the director intended to do that in order to confuse us, which I think is awesome. About the totem, despite the fact that Cobb was in the real world, I believe the director was just trying to tell us that it didn't matter to Cobb whether he was dreaming or was in the real world. What mattered to him was that he was with his children, in his home in his country. This opens the door for a widely debated subject that is discussed in the movie: what is real and what is illusion? If one is living in a happy beautiful illusion, does it really matter? Should our experiences only count if they were experienced in the real world as we know it? And for that matter, how can one know that this whole big world is not another dream and that we are not sleeping somewhere waiting to wake up?",1
"One of the best films of the year. In 2005, I walked out of Batman Begins with a huge smile on my face! I could not wait for this sequel.Batman Begins was everything I wanted in a Batman film, it had tons of action, superb acting and direction, nifty camera work, and a story to tell. It was the Batman film I have been waiting for. Now this is probably one of the best comic book superhero films of all time.As Kevin Smith said, it really is the Godfather Pt. II of comic book films. The acting is it's chief strength in this movie. Christian Bale is the best Batman/Bruce Wayne of all time, thank god Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes, and Heath Ledger god rest his soul. Ledger was the perfect Joker, even better than the great Jack Nicholson. Ledger's performance is so terrifying, and he brings depth, realism, and fear to his Joker. I really hope they give him an award. The film has a great supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as DA Harvey Dent, who becomes Two-Face, Gary Oldman as Lt. James Gordan, Michael Cain as Bruce's trustworthy butler, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Christopher Nolan again will blow you away with this one, as he did in Batman Begins. The action scenes rock, and they don't look fake at all the stunts are amazing.The Dark Knight tops The Incredible Hulk and in a few ways tops Iron Man. I would say this is right next to Spider-Man 2 one of my personal favorites. This film is completely flawless, and it is one of the best films of 2008, and a movie you must see! Just like Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original in almost every way possible! The story is so well written, and the script just keeps the film going and moving in a good pace, and I was never bored with the sub-plots, or even the love triangle between Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent, and Rachel Dawes.The run time is long, but I must tell all who read this review, that it is the fastest two-hour thirty-minute epic I have ever seen in a long time. Not a minute in this film I was thinking, oh they should have cut at least seven or eight minutes. This is an Oscar worthy film, I know the Acadmey will not give it any recognition, because they are just not fair. Like all those other superhero flicks that do deserve nominations besides special effects, like Batman Begins, Spider-Man 2, X2:X-Men United, this year's Iron Man, or many, many other comic book flicks that are Oscar worthy.In closing The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, and will not disappoint fans of Batman, and this is a comic book movie for non-comic book fans, and it'll leave a lot of fan boys wanting more. I know I did, and I hope the third chapter of the Nolan series will come out soon, and top this one.",1
"The Dark Knight it's not only the greatest superhero movie ever made, this is one of the greatest film of the century. Christopher Nolan takes the Gotham City into a realistic world. And the writing it's just flawless, and not to mention the cast from Christian Bale to Gary Oldman to Aaron Eckhart and most of all Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger give and left us with one of the greatest performances in cinema this is truly one of the best movie ever.",1
"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shaw shank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shaw shank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.",1
"Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design makes the movie ""Fight Club"" a wild ride. It's one of those mind benders where the more you think about it, the greater it gets. Its funny, brutal, sadistic and a true masterpiece. The movie itself represents the desperate cry of the consumerist modern man for something to put out the anxiety and conformism of his life - taking shape in a brutal, over-violent anarchy of religious echoes. A dangerous movie for the mainstream audience, who will certainly misunderstand its brilliant, powerful statement. The message is simple. Get off your ass and go do something so you don't end up like the narrator or the followers that simply follow orders, no matter how brutal said orders goes.",1
"Definitely must watch, it was a great movie and a very thrilling twist. I had to rate it from how good it was.",1
"I had come across reviews that compare this film to Matrix. Notwithstanding all its bluster, the first Matrix was built around a very basic and ancient philosophical argument: which is real, the physical around us or the world in our minds, i.e. our perception of the world? Which is worth preserving, the perception or the physical? In other words, should we take the juicy steak our mind tells us we are having, or should we make do with the muck? Even the action was wrapped around this basic argument and it lent its strength to the film, the first at least.Inception is action packed. It doesn't exactly take your breath away, but it takes you to the end. The images are good, the acting is alright, you are left with a feeling of satisfaction at the end. But Inception doesn't give you arguments about the nature of dreams or the human mind. You can find some parallels in a few of the action sequences, but it doesn't give you the same kind of mind-tickling Matrix gave.Watch it. You will enjoy it for what it is.",1
"After viewing Fight Club, a lot of ideas will run through your mind. This is the sign of a great film. It doesn't just entertain and hold you in suspense; any simple, ordinary film can do that. David Fincher's extraordinary tale about male aggression and the oppression we face from everyday marketing and materialism takes all this to another level, pushing us to the very maximum that we are able to handle. It all starts out so simple and dark: a nameless, obsolete insurance worker sleepwalks through his life all the while working a job he hates to buy crap he doesn't need. He needs a change and the audience knows this as well. For the first 30-40 minutes of the movie, we get a dark tone of political and social satire that really makes you think of what kind of film this is. Then, it all changes. Just like Edward Norton's character, our entire experience is jolted when Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden steps into the frame. For the rest of the running time, we are thrown and tossed about back and forth, helplessly watching this confusion and chaos bring itself to light. At times, we have to scratch our heads as it can get carried out of hand, but never does this film get off track and fall into obscurity. There is a clear message here, although it may have multiple explanations. Cinematically, this is one of the most brilliantly-shot movies in recent memory. Fincher's directing style is so clever and slick that it perfectly complements the settings and the acting. That being said, the acting is some of the best you will see in any movie. Brad Pitt is mesmerizing and easy to hate at the same time, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a strong supporting role. However, it is the work of Edward Norton that makes this movie memorable and stays with you long after it is over. In every scene he is in, and there are a lot of them, Norton perfectly captures the attitude and feelings of the Narrator. At first, he is depressed and out of touch with reality. As the story moves on, he becomes more aware and self-destructive. The audience also becomes more involved as we wonder where this could lead. Perhaps the most striking thing about Fight Club is that the premise is entirely plausible. It is not ridiculous at all to think that such an idea could spring up and alter the course of many peoples' lives. Still, this film provides more warning than suggestions. Simply put, this film is not just for entertainment value. There is much more here than meets the eye. Of course, not everyone will take it for anything other than face value. But, if you look closer and really try to understand this fascinating story, you will see a message; just don't be able to decipher it anytime soon.",1
"A classic from excellent producers. Top quality presentation. Good actors, good budget. Certainly a must watch! From the critics point of view, it took quiet a while for the story to get a direction in the plot (Escape plan). It also took a while to get the characters in place. A certain degree is direction loss with the story concerning the incarceration in the first place. As if there wasn't a great plot to convict, but a need for conviction so that the character is in place. A master piece in concealing details of processes involved. Of course, Morgan Freeman was the highlight in the casting, but William Sadler and Tim Robbins were excellent additions. Set in the earlier 21st Century during the probation years.",1
"First of all, I need to point out that I'm not a Batman fan, or Superman, or Marvel, may be a Vertigo, D.C. yes, but I try to be totally neutral when I review a movie.I have watched all Batman movies, including Batman Begins. But I find myself hard to explain what is the purpose of making a new Batman movie. Well Batman Begins point out that Batman must have his background history, how Batman became Batman himself. But I found Batman Begins with a lot of failures, like: the action sequence camera, some special effects are cheap, and it's not even a good movie. Not a masterpiece at all. And I found myself trying to digest how the daily and actual public of cinema ignores what a real masterpiece could be, it's a shame how we have ignore the epic work of real masterpiece, the hard dedication it takes to do a tremendous film. The Dark Knight points out to be more realistic than the other Batman movies, but not darker, since Batman Returns it's know as the darker one of all Batman films. Batman has been changed from a 60's family show, to a darker series of movies but the Dark Knight cannot make the plot of a millionaire dressed like a bat, fighting against villains and crazy maniac realistic, because the plot doesn't need to be realistic. Batman in a realistic way it's having another hero, not Batman. So then the point of making another Batman movie because it's going to be realistic it's meaningless. May be the movie it has a serious point, but?not really. The acting was overall good, but some of the acting in the film it's feels like it's natural, not hard to act, it's just simple. The action sequences are really good, or at least better than Batman Begins, but there is not enough action to really name the movie an action movie, the special effects where the best part. To have a better knowledge of the characters, you need to watch Batman Begins, but there is no background history of the main antagonist: The Joker. You can't consider this movie as an action-present movie, where the only things that matters is what you see trough the entire film because the last movie would be meaningless, but it's not so cleaver what are the real characters purposes either. Also the personality of all the characters are too simple or too complex (I mean, they could be a lot of options of what is the real meaning of the character's actions), that you get eventually confused. May be this was an attempt of making the movie more realistic (with different thoughts, feelings and values over a confused mind), but having a personality like the Joker, and having a realistic personality of Batman it really doesn't fit. Another thing is that there is no blood where it should be in the movie, which is not realistic, and I'm not saying a movie need blood in order to be good, because I enjoyed watching physiological terror like Rosemary Baby, showing horror movies doesn't need to have action violence, with blood in order to be good, but the lack of blood it just points that the movie can't be realistic, because realistic means aggressive too. The dialog had changed into something different from a Super Hero movie.So at the end it leaves me the question of: What is this movie?Not realistic, but not really a child movie either. Not comedy but not so serious. Not Super Hero, But not Hero movie either. Not drama movie.I'm sure producers and the staff in general worked hard to bring the best material in this movie, you can see that, but it seems they tried to satisfy all kind of public and because of that it doesn't have a solid structure to describe it. May be they where so concentrated in the special effects they didn't take care a lot of those things, either way you can't skip out those mistakes, having a movie without an structure, it's having a man without a vertebral spine, and by structure I mean a purpose, more than satisfy Batman's fans. My conclusion is: this is a Blockbuster, an ""ok"" movie with some great special effects but without an structure to make it solid, a meaning to make ourselves concentrate on that specific point like comedy, or drama. And I'm sure, this is not a masterpiece.",1
I really do adore this movie so well acted written well superb effects and atmosphere. The cast is quite a treat good chemistry and well directed to boot. I do add one caveat this movie is very out of the box and abstract. If you don't enjoy deep and odd psychological themes you wont get parts. I think this is Nolan's best work and deserving of praise. Yes I will admit if the effects weren't so good it would be a bit less impressive. Watch this with a somewhat open mind and you should be pleased.,1
"No doubt about the success of the film.Stunning concept by Christopher Nolan and superb presentation by Leonardo.Incredible visual effects with a nice back ground score.Leonardo has became one of ""THE BEST ACTOR"" for me in recent times and i simply love his acting.The best word I can use for this movie is Intelligent. Inception is the most intelligent movie ever made. What a script!!!!Hats off to Leonardo and the entire team of Inception. You will need to watch this movie twice to understand its complexity and to figure it out completely.This movie is one of the best movies made till date and is a must watch for all movie lovers.",1
"It never ceases to amaze me how the flavor of the day can impact people's actions. How many people went out and saw this movie because of the cleverly hyped story about the portrayal of the joker contributing to Heath Ledger's deteriorated mental state at the time of his death? Oh man is he dark and crazy and totally deserves every award in cinema, right? I guess this review is aimed more at the fanboy reviewers than the movies. I gave this movie 6 stars out of ten which I honestly feel it deserved. This movie is not flawless. It doesn't deserve 10 out of 10. Your ignorance is displacing other really good movies on the Top 250 list for movies that don't belong in the Top 750.""But I really do think it's perfect!!"" Let me point out a few imperfections: 1) Maggie Gylenhal's performance was flat and uninspired. 2) Because one man's cell phone is designed as a sonar device everybody else's phone in the city now has that capability? Smells fishy. 3) With said sonar technology you can create a map on a monitor that is so easy to use a smart guy can figure it out and use it to save your life in a matter of hours. 4) Batman's voice...AGAIN!I could continue this list but you really only need one flaw to ruin perfection. This site used to be perfect when people gave honest reviews. At first I was tempted to give this movie (and Inception, which is actually worse than this) a 1 star rating. But my reputation will not be tarnished!",1
"My Take: A bold, visionary modern classic.No joke here! THE DARK KNIGHT, the new Batman thriller from Christopher Nolan, has a lot of buzz that comes along the merchandise and the marketing, but it avoids all the shortcomings, and even in fact going beyond audience expectations. After Nolan's own brooding and realistic version BATMAN BEGINS, audience expected a similar approach on DARK KNIGHT. The arrogant Bruce Wayne, the darker vigilante Batman, no nipples on the Batsuit, all that is fulfilled in this new film, but this is also darker and much better than anyone in the audience expected it to be. In fact, it's the darkest, deepest and most significant and exciting one in the series since BATMAN RETURNS. While it takes a different path from the original series (although thankfully, staying much away from the awful BATMAN & ROBIN), this is the new Batman for the new ages.Christian Bale reprises his role as the most arrogant (and best) Bruce Wayne, and alter ego Batman, who once again sets out to restore order in the crime-ridden streets of Gotham City (not exactly the land of opportunity), as it is once again leaking with criminality and injustice, in the form of the evil Joker (the late Heath Ledger, who makes a brilliant performance in his last film that made the evening news) and crime lords who terrorize and make their own circus of chaos. It's up to the Bat to put a stop to it all, but this time, it ain't juts gonna be his job. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the hero without a mask who lends his own hands to keep Gotham in high stands against crime, despite the every growing urban chaos. Dent also happens to be dating Bruce Wayne's best friend Rachael Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Mrs. Cruise Katie Holmes), blooming up a little love triangle that doesn't go corny at all.Nolan's Batman worlds are fantastic and effective ones. Whilst not the visually eye-popping Blade Runner-era Gotham City that Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS was, but surely much closer to the reality of current situations. This time, the threats are real, and the solutions to the problems are far more desperate than kicking ass. Crime is real, crime is bad, and Nolan emphasizes on every frame. The absolute reality of the picture is one of the reasons why it's the best and most topical Bat-film to date. But DARK KNIGHT is a mere subject discussion. The excitement comes in waves, from chases down the dark streets with trucks, vans, and the Bat's own Batmobile (which transforms into a speeding motor-bike when it self-destructs), or battle sequences that are intense as they are well-made, DARK KNIGHT satisfies as pure entertainment. The screenplay is bold and daring, venturing into a subject so much deeper than where it usually settles upon (enough to make you forget the fiasco BATMAN & ROBIN was). Then there are the performances, mentioning the late Mr. Ledger's performance front and center, are excellent and nearly flawless. To date, it may be the best performed superhero flick I've ever seen.All-in-all, THE DARK KNIGHT is the superhero mainstream of the summer you have got to see if you see no other (and I may doubt that you'll see more). No joke! Rating: ***** out of 5.",1
"Firstly, this film is not like you might think it is; it's not irreverently violent, it's not mindless entertainment, and it's not a film in which Brad Pitt gets his pretty face re-arranged!It is however a well written, depressingly claustrophobic, finely acted and funny film, that has a delicious and unpredictable plot twist (for those who didn't know). Me saying that this film is ""depressingly claustrophobic"" is not to put it down, as I am so tired of films that do not draw you in or engage you in any way. Just moving wall paper. This film is probably quite different to most films you will have seen, so I can not insist strongly enough that whoever you are you see this movie, for an experience that may change your perspective on films if it doesn't alter what you expect from films.SEE IT! (now) it's more fun than most of the other c**p you'll find in your video store at least!",1
I liked Christopher Nolan's touch that the movie ended and you Do not know if it was a dream or real world!!!!,1
My Favorited movie based on Steven King novel ever!,1
"A dreamer never cowardice to hide in their own imaginary dreams and is always brave to face the cold and cruel reality and dare to ask himself - ""who am I? This is the great man and the life everyone wants. If this life is a dream, let me sleep until the natural wake up. I will accept all the reality and love the dream, also will not refuse the reality.",1
Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen.,1
"This is one of those movies that I got used to hearing ""You can see it when your older."" Well, finally saw it and was totally amazed with everything. The direction, th acting, everything.The Acting- The eye candy doesn't get much better than this. (sorry if I come across as shallow)Brad Pitt gives a great performance, being scary, sexy, mysterious and downright awesome with no spots in between. Not to mention he was very, very attractive. Edward Norton, who I couldn't get over at how fast he slimmed down for this gave an unforgettable performance. Everything came off right, the narration, the beating himself up (best part ever). And for last Helena Bonham Carter, her acting was amazing, she was playing such a sleazy character but she did it without overacting at all.The Direction- Perfect, the shots, the small uses of effects everything.The Script- Perfect & logical. With the right mix of seriousness and humor.All in all: 10/10 great movie, good acting, attractive men, fist-fighting. Don't get much better. :) -Hannah S.",1
"A long time ago, I didn't finish watching half of the movie. I remember that the color of the whole movie was too dark to watch. This time, I finally watched it twice, and then I was even more depressed.",1
"To have not one but three glaring product placements for Pepsi seems somewhat to render the anti-corporate message of Fight Club a tad hypocritical.  Shame, as this put me off what was otherwise a technically brilliant and thought provoking film.",1
"I know giving The Dark Knight a perfect ten might not be highly original,but this film really does deserve it.Having said that there are a couple of things that bothered slightly but they weren't enough to really have an impact on my score.But more on those things a bit later i'll start with the good things.First off the cinematography is a big step up from the first film,more in the fight scenes than anything else,I know Christopher Nolan had intended the scenes to be hard to see because we were seeing Batman fight from the perspective of the criminals but it never really sat well with me only because i'm just not a fan at that kind of thing in the slightest,Also with such an unknown fighting style I really wanted to see how it worked,well know Christopher has decided to fix that and pans along with the action rather than cutting all over the place.Next up is the music and it's wonderful, it perfectly captures the mood and helps tie you with the characters emotions,I really love the creepy ticking/scraping sound at the beginning logos.The writing for this film is set to go down with the best scripts in cinema history,with so much happening it would have been easy to fall into the trap of it not making any sense at all or trying to fit so much in that it got boring,but that's not the case,I was always interested in what was going to happen next and everything was written so well that i was never confused as to what was happening.Now the acting,I don't think there was one person in this film who didn't do a great job,Christian Bale was excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman,at many points in this film you see the internal struggle that's happening inside him and at other times complete hopelessness,like he just doesn't know what to do,Aaron Eckhart gives Harvey Dent a real purpose and creates a very good, honest, likable character who you really feel sorry for when he eventually falls,whats more I could understand what his pain was and why he was doing the bad things he ended up doing.Maggie Gylannhaal is just a hell of a better actress than Katie Holmes will ever be,Maggie gives Rachel soul and a reason for being,all Katie Holmes gave was this smarmy little smirk on her face that I just wanted to smack off.Micheal Caine,Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman all gave their usual great performances,but the one everyone's talking about is Heath.There's not much to say that hasn't already been said by every other person on the planet so i'll say that it's all true,no performance i've seen has had this impact on me,i'll never forget it.One of the things that really make the Joker work for me personally is the way he is always licking his lips,i really works in two ways,one is it's like a tick he has just because he's crazy and second if I have those scars around my mouth i'd probably feel them with my tongue constantly too.So there was really only two things that bothered me and that was that I didn't feel the city was the same,obviously going from a giant set to filming in Chicago it will look different,but it just seemed to go from this giant dark Gothic city with things overhanging everywhere to.....well Chicago.Last but not least I think the Scarcrow was wasted in this film,it felt too much like they were just trying to get him out the way so we wouldn't have to worry about him,they could have just not put him in and it would've done well to save him as the enemy if they chose make another film,but I guess they needed a reason to introduce the Batman copycats.This is the best movie you will see this year,if there's anyone left that hasn't seen it see it at the movies at least once,because it just won't be the same on DVD.",1
"Christopher Nolan has yet again out done himself with a mind blowing storyline and his nonparallel directing skills. After writing and directing a mega blockbuster, The Dark Knight, Nolan has created a super mega blockbuster, Inception. He has yet again created a different level in story writing and film making and he has reached new heights which no one has.The movie is absolutely visually stunning - god like cinematography, heart pounding - non stop pace, out of this world storyline and amazing acting - Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page & Joseph Gorden-Levitt. This movie will keep you guessing until the very end and there is not a single second where you want to look away from this movie.Nolan is not the only one who has reached new heights with this film but also Leonardo DiCaprio. Caprio has been vintage in this movie and his performance was beyond outstanding. Nonetheless, Ellen Page and Joseph Gorden-Levitt have also performed extremely well in their respective roles. There is no doubt Inception is going to bag good amount of Oscars - Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Screenplay, Visual Effects and probably Film Editing.Nolan has yet to write and direct a film that is below hit level. Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and now Inception. After watching Inception, I can't wait to see what he will have stored in his next movie, which he just announced, Batman 3. Batman 3 will be releasing in 2012. I know its a long time to wait but when it comes to Nolan its worth it.",1
"this film has everything brilliant actors(brad pitt and edward norton), good action scenes and a brilliant story line , which has one of the best twists ever in film it even makes the whole outlook of the film completely different the 2nd time round u see it, a must see for anyone",1
"One of the greatest movie i have ever seen,i like the two actors",1
"All time favorite and a classic movie to watch. No wounder it is on top of the IMDB all-time best, slow at the beginning the movie develops into something mesmerizing.I can only wounder what producers and director(s) went through in the making of this movie.",1
"A lot has been written about this film already so I won't repeat the obvious. It is, overall, a very good movie. But it has a big problem.The emotional core of Inception is DiCaprio's character and his ""relationship"" with his wife, Mal. Whenever the movie is telling that story it's fantastic. Whenever it's not, it's not.The end result is a mostly-great movie with about 45 minutes of unnecessary explosions stapled on.The ultra-generic action sequences (with one notable, Matrix-esquire exception that ends much too quickly) are tiring and unexciting, and show a distinct lack of imagination. The Dark Knight demonstrated that this otherwise-gifted director has trouble building coherent/engaging action scenes, but the gimmicky nature of the Batman franchise made it forgivable. In Inception that failing takes center stage since the last 45 minutes demand almost non-stop action that Nolan is frankly unable to deliver. Placed beside The Matrix, or even this-year's Kick-Ass, the snowy final battle in Inception is downright boring and threatens to bring the film to an anti-climax. Fortunately the resolution of DiCaprio's storyline is fantastically engaging and brings the rest of the movie up with it.I wonder if Nolan is wasting his considerable story-telling talents working in a genre he doesn't love. This man does not want to film action; it's obvious. Maybe he should just stop trying and focus on telling the tales he wants to tell instead.",1
"It was with great reluctance that I watch batman begins seeing as Nolan directs his movie in a clear attempt to out stage Tim Burton's version by portraits similar scenes to the ones that catch in the Burton movie like the ¨I'm batman¨scene; and like the introduction of the batmovil. The previous statements and comments on this recreation of batman to make it less like the previous version and more like the action comics; elevated much of fan expectations. Seeing as Nolan fails to focus the production on this goal the results showed on the box office as the movie produced shy of $50million less than the 16 year old remark.It is true to say that the attempt succeeds to restore batman's image after the horrifying spectacle Schumacher put us fans through with his sequels. It is with a refreshing attitude that i came out to see the latest of Nolan's batman seeing how he goes to the original idea of bringing the Dark Knight back to his essential basics. Not killing the villains, focusing on the antihero status that batman stands for, the whole creation an make up of the villains not diminishing there characters to improve the plot was great and commendable. Though the competition with the Burton version remain but fortunately it didn't break the movie's directed effect to the audience. I loved it and any other batman fan should think the same and hope for a third part. Shame the joker's interpreter died cause he did manage to convey the sicotic dark humor that was so much need to contrast batman.I really love the movie's structure and I will follow it for the time that the Francaise continues to serve me such a wonderful show.",1
"In my opinion, the best Batman movie and the best comic-book adaptation ever. Mature, engaging and complex. Shades of Frank Miller's work and nods to Batman's darker origins as envisaged by Bob Kane.I love the character contrasts in this movie. Alfred is a great foil for Bruce Wayne. Gordon is a great foil for Harvey Dent.The movie has its roots in comics, so I can forgive the occasional lapse in realism - the 'skyhook' rescue - and it all looks spectacular and I never expected realism in the first place.Performance wise, the movie is hard to fault. From 'Zeus' as one of the prisoners - surprisingly good, to Eric Roberts - again, surprisingly good, through to the leads. A million other people will comment on Heath Ledger, so I won't go on too much about him, but he is stunningly brilliant. A twitching, clicking, off the wall performance. My favourite scene? The Joker leaning out the cop car window and all you hear is the wind rushing past him. Absolutely captures the Joker's anarchic world.Christian Bale captures the struggle of Batman's dark side and his faith in humanity wonderfully. Tortured but ultimately good. Christopher Nolan wisely chooses not to overplay the gore. There is plenty of violence but not much blood. Sometimes things are best left 'suggested' rather than graphically displayed. This may have been done for rating purposes, but for me, it works.A superb piece of cinema.",1
"What can be said that already hasn't been. Shawshank Redemption is a spectacular film which focuses on Hope and fear. Morgan Freeman does what he always does, delivers a fine, unforgettable performance. With a voice like that it extremely hard too. As Red, Freeman narrates the tale of how a man wrongly accused of Murder, is sent to life in prison and has nothing but hope to cling on.Stephen King epitomise great storytelling. You don't need twists every scene nor do we need a complex plot that tries to hard to stand out. With colourful characters and fantastic interactions, a story can truly become personal. OK, many here has probably never been sent to prison for something they didn't do but this doesn't stop anyone from imagining the fear and hopelessness that one must go through when stripped from their freedom and rights.There only few films out there that makes the most out off every shot. Shawshank is one of those. There not one wasted second, no scene which could or should of been cut from the final version. Everything is done to perfection. You can feel and sense the delinquency and effort put into the film which luckily for us, makes the viewing that extra special.Pointless it may seem, writing a review for a film which has already been critique to death, but heck, a little more praise won't do any harm. Yes, you will get your snobs who will bang on about how this film doesn't deserve to be number one, but those are the ones who believe a story must be plagued by thought provoking twists. All i have to say is that Shawshank is a heart warming tale that will no doubt leave you in a fuzzy ball of warmth and amazement when the credits begin to roll down on this extraordinary tale",1
"I went on premiere of new Batman here in Croatia and as soon as I came home I wanted to write a comment about this one. The reason is obvious; I wanted to be able to write all what I need to say now, when I'm still 'fresh' and under impression of this great movie. Although my favorite director is Tim Burton and his way of presenting Gotham City is still my favorite, I must say that this is the best Batman movie made. It is way better even from the last Nolan's Batman. My respect to Mr. Nolan goes way back to his first movie, and till today that man doesn't have a stain on his career. Not only that his movies are OK, but they are great and he really enriches world of movies. So that is all about Nolan, cause I'm eager to talk about the movie.What I liked is well made story that will surely keep you awake right till the end (even though the movie is long - 152 minutes). I admit that at first I was bit skeptic about Joker entering in the Batman series again. For a long time Jack Nicholson had no competition and no one really dared to think about playing Joker. Not until now. Late Heath Ledger had guts to show the world what Joker is like. He created his own Joker, different from Nicholson, but equally or even more brilliant. You see, Nicholson has that 'crazy' face and smile and Ledger had to start from nothing. Sadly, one brilliant actor is not with us today but he will always live through his movies. The role of Joker made him world wide known (even to not movie or Batman fans) and in my opinion took his life. It would be a shame if Academy decides not to give him honor in a figure of nomination for Best Supporting actor, at least.Every character in this movie is shown to us right to the bones. Bruce Wayne (Batman) is presented as hero, that is also only human (that's what I liked about Batman in general - he is only human, with no special powers, only gadgets). Human who acts by the emotions but hero who will take the responsibility on his back and became object of hate because he is the strongest. Not machine, but human. Christian Bale is only solid, cause he is out shined by Ledger and Eckhart (same thing happened to Keaton in very first Batman with Nicholson). Aaron Eckhart is another actor who shines here as Harvey Dent (Two-Face). His character is the most complex one in entire movie cause he became something that he despised - a criminal. Personal tragedy created lunatic from him who lets coin to decide if someone is going to be killed or spared. Acting and evolving of Eckhart/Dent is brilliant and for every price (specially one to screenplay writers - brothers Nolan). Women, Rachel Dawes, who makes love interest for both Dent and Wayne is played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. It is a great choice, over Katie Holmes from ""Batman Begins"", because Maggie is so natural actress that is great to watch her on screen and her character is the tragic one (I would say more then the ones of Wayne and Dent). Lt. James Gordon is played by great Gary Oldman with enough emotions that makes his character believable (specially last scenes with his family). Screen legends, Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman, are given smaller but very important roles. Caine as Alfred, Wayne's conscience and Freeman as Lucius, inventor and friend. Although the atmosphere of Nolan's Gotham is not as dark as Burton's, Nolan's characters are darker and stylish and in all that dark there is light at the end; people on those two ferries showed that even though there is lots of suffering and evil on this world (in Gotham), that when it comes down everyone can be united in life or death - that is also a great victory over Joker who never thought that that kind of scenario will happen. Everything is described in words of H.Dent: ""The night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you, the dawn is coming.""At the end, I will also add that this movie has some parts not explained till the end (like Scarecrow's appearance for only a minute or what happened to Joker - he stayed alive so some other actor would take Ledger's place; not like original script were Joker dies). Probably that is all done because of Ledger's death. But all in all, this is a must see movie for everyone and I'll give it the highest grade. Not because I think this is the greatest movie of all time (like IMDb list says) but because this is the best Batman movie and great idea that came alive by great director, actors, writers and all who worked on this special movie. Thank you all!",1
"People thought that even after Begins that The Batman franchise couldn't be pushed any further well this exceeds all the other Batman films and the Hero genre and its franchises for that matter. Burtons work was visually stunning with a good list of actors, however it lacked the realism down to earth sensibilities and intensity that Christopher Nolan's film offers. Characters with versatile down to earth characteristics that all feel unsatisfied with the situations around them either from an protagonist or antagonistic perspective. Most of the characters come from the perspective of hope for the City of Gotham to become a safer more accessible place.Christian Bale reprises his role as a fully formed Batman who hopes to retire his alter-ego. To do this he has hopes in a hero without a mask that of Aaron Eckhart Harvey Dent. Who is a supposedly fearless and incorruptible man who is cleaning up the Gotham city in ways its never seen in a long time. That is until Heath Ledgers legendary role as fully formed non-compassionate emotionless psychopathic purely evil brutal Joker. In the past the joker has been depicted as a villainous notorious social pariah with a sense of sanity. This Joker is someone who has no ambitious goal just wanting to commit chaos. His presence provides a sense of dark humor that the audience can enjoy through how he manipulates and takes control of everything.This film is a portrayal of depicting a good vs. evil scenario similar to J.R. Tolkens idea in Lord of The Rings. This film has a thick plot dark presence like Batman should truly be, not some Comic Book cliché that appeals to children like Joel Schumachers work, but something with deep material and believable characters. I think this film is one of the best films of the decade and will probably be nominated if not than the Oscars are ignoring one of Hollywoods biggest film powerhouses.",1
"Too many points, too many feelings. It is the best movie for good, however times passes and things changes",1
"I saw this one with a friend some time ago. I've seen it a couple of times more, because I notice more and more ingenious little details and you understand it better and better. It has become my second favorite movie of ALL TIME (1st being Shawshank Redemption). And I'm pretty picky.*ONLY READ IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT!* You hear ""Fight Club"". Then it's sure to be a movie stuffed with raw action and brutal fight scenes? You're a bit off the hook. So we start by seeing the narrator held at gunpoint, and then everything leading up to it is being told to us by said narrator. He suffers from insomnia, and his addiction with getting close to people in support groups for various deceases sets a moody opening-feel. It sounds absurd, but it works so well, and it even throws in elements of the darkest humor I've ever heard. And I absolutely loved it. Along comes a woman who disturbs the supports groups, named Marla Singer. She is one of Helena Bonham Carter's career highlights (my opinion). Marla's eccentric personality is Carter's specialty as an actress. Anyway, the real good stuff begins when the narrator's apartment is set on fire, and he has to live with a soap-maker named Tyler Durden. He and the narrator starts an underground fight club after realizing how good you feel after fighting someone. At a point, Marla comes between them when she becomes Tyler's lover, to the narrator's great annoyance, him hating Marla. As more and more members join in, it evolves out of the basement and is reborn in public as Project Mayhem. The narrator feels it has all gotten out of control, and tries to stop Tyler before he goes too far. But he eventually finds out that Tyler is a person invented by himself as a ""back-up"" when he thinks he is asleep. It escalates to the point where the Tyler-side gets shot and killed by the narrator-side, but by then it's too late to stop Project Mayhem's final purpose. The narrator is Edward Norton, which pretty much guaranties you that there will be quality. But Brad Pitt does his best performance ever as Tyler Durden. The fight scenes are brutal (especially one where a blond man has his face beaten to complete dis-figuration), as the rest of the movie is uncompromising. It will hit you pretty hard (pun intended) the first time you see it. And the second. And so on. It raises a LOT of existential questions and will force you to think about how you are living your life. It's a two and a half hour long barrage of amazing acting, mind-blowing storyline and special moments that makes Fight Club impossible to overlook or forget. A nifty detail I liked is how we get to know that Tyler works with connecting movie reels at cinemas, and how he uses ""artistic freedom"" to make it an exciting job. We are treated to Tyler's pranks while watching this movie. There is a flash image of a penis right before the end credits starts to roll, and four short ""blink-and-you-miss-it"" stills where an image of Tyler is put into the support groups. Brilliant xD. It's the kind of movie that you want to watch again the second it has ended. Unfortunately I'm limited to 1000 words, so I can't continue forever, so I will just finish it now.Fight Club is, to me, modern-day classic",1
Unfortunately I didn't watch it in theater because I wanted to watch it in English. Before this I only waited so hard only fo HP. So the movie. Without spoilers of cause. The plot. Yes the plot is... well it's Nolan so it's obious that it's awesome. Of cause It explores dreams and it's really interisting. The movie builds layers upon layers and it's cool. In Inception there is two twists - at the end and almost at the end. Of cause there aren't as many as in Prestige bus they really great. In the end you'll have to make a chose. But enough of that. Special effects. Because the movie takes place in the dream they could do some cool stuff. Really cool. And it truly deserved Oscar for that. Soundtrack is amesing though I like TDK's soundtrack just a bit better. Acting is as awesome as in Dark Knight but is it better than the DK? I can't say it's better cause the dark knight is like my favorite movie. It's as good as. So yeah that's that. I have no idea why Nolan didn't win an Oscar. So watch it like right now.,1
"Fincher picks up where he left off with ""The Game"" and finally hits his stride.  Whereas ""The Game"" was a movie trying desperately to be novel, ""Fight Club"" succeeded as being the best black comedic satire in several years.  While the mainstream critics once again missed the boat, getting side tracked by the movie's violence and neo-fascist imagery, Fincher, Norton, et al. sat back and laughed.  Easily the most original movie of the year, ""Fight Club"" illustrated how creative CGI can be in a movie that isn't a standard action adventure romp.  Splicing in Tyler Durden's image at key moments added to the richness of a story that was as tightly told as the ""Usual Suspects"".  ""Fight Club"" is a must see film, not for its gimmicks, action scenes, or visual effects, it is a must see film because it is funny. Funny???  Yes folks funny.  In-between the blood and vandalism there are classic lines about Generation X and in particular the ""X"" men as Durden quips:""Our generation has had no Great Depression, no Great War. Our war is a spiritual war. Our depression is our lives.""and""We are a generation of men raised by women. I'm beginning to wonder if another woman is what we really need.""If you sat in the theater taking this movie on its face as a film about a psychopath and his desire to re-order the world, I would hope you had problems with it.  If however, you got the joke and saw the film as slap in the face of an entire generation of weak, materialistic, and gullible kids looking for meaning between the pages of self help books and Saks Fifth Ave. you laughed along with me and recognized this a great film.",1
"that there will be a Fight Club re-release on dvd which they have stopped doing. The reason I say this is because if anyone knows sound wise, DTS is much better than Dolby Digital, they have to put out a DTS version of the movie, cause I mean good lord its Fight Club, not some fruit loops commercial!!!",1
"Inception is also very inventive, and utterly riveting. The thought of someone else taking control of one's dreams is a frightening prospect, but is brilliantly presented in this film. It gets a bit complicated when the different ""levels"" are introduced, but this leads to some Oscar-potential editing. In fact, this film should win several Oscars; best picture, best director, best supporting actor (Ellen Page), as well as the editing one. I can hardly wait to watch the film again. I've been a fan of Christopher Nolan since Memento, but with this film, he was really excelled himself. I just wonder what he'll think of next. One more line for good luck.",1
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is an accountant who, accused of murdering his wife, entered Shawshank prison in 1947. Dufresne, just like everybody else, claims he is innocent. Only in his case, it's actually true. Pretty soon his stoic manner gets the attention of narrator Redding (Morgan Freeman). Redding is the local smuggler. He admires Andy's positive attitude. Even the tough regime of Shawshank prison can't break him.The life in Shawshank prison is presented as metaphor for our real society. Wherein the ""prisoners of life"" accept their fate and stop dreaming to avoid being disappointed. Offcourse there's always one who is determined to break through.The Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope, friendship and surviving within the walls of a heavily guarded prison. This movie is a shiny jewel. It tastes like the freedom of a silver-blue bird a summer day. Like strolling around the prison yard as if you could just leave for a cocktail party at any moment. Freedom after twenty years of confinement. The Shawshank Redemption colors the darkest mood sky-blue. The color of the sea. The color of Andy's freedom.",1
fight club is a brilliant film accomplishment! its unique storytelling makes it a real treat to watch. never has a movie made me feel so spotineity driven! its a rush! one of the very best films ever made! what is your power animal?,1
"Super Film. Der Joker ist einmalig.
Die Musik passt perfekt zu dem Film.",1
"yes, is most of on great film and helps to show very beauty film That is the case for most of Illumination's projects, so I must start by commending their advertising team. Although this movie was funny, the trailer seemed to showcase most of the jokes and gags seen in the movie. The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more aimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their competing studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a pretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I felt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character development was very robust for the amount of characters featured in the film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the main characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very well lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely detailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch. I would recommend if you're looking for a fun movie to watch that's not too thought provoking.",1
"There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.",1
"Inception (2010) Christopher Nolan has often explored the relationship between human perception and reality. 'Memento (2000)' was told backwards, forcing the viewer to rely upon the damaged first-person memory of its amnesiac protagonist. 'The Prestige (2006)' concerned misdirection and trickery, highlighting the role of the movie director as a magician, a shyster, a charlatan, deftly blurring the line between what the viewer is shown, and what actually is. Even 'Batman Begins (2004),' via the Scarecrow's creepy hallucinogenic toxin, hinted at how the human mind could unwittingly distort one's perception of reality. 'Inception (2010)' once again brings Nolan into familiar territory, an action film dripping with metaphysical philosophy: what is a dream? Why do we dream? And are you dreaming right now?Philip K. Dick succinctly described reality as ""that which, when you stop believing it, doesn't go away."" Our dreams are manufactured realities that seem every bit as expansive and convincing as our everyday lives, namely because the brain shuts off the segment of our brains responsible for logic (indeed, in one dream, I've walked through my front door, come out into a football stadium, and thought nothing of it). Who's to know whether or not I'll wake up in 70 years time, laugh to myself, and think ""blue skies? How absurd!"" Shifting levels of consciousness have become common fodder in science-fiction (see, for example, 'Dark City (1998)' and 'The Matrix (1999),' but here I loved how Nolan twisted and warped the fabric of his cinematic universe like an Escher lithograph. Buildings leans and distorts; gravity shifts or disappears; in one particularly magnificent sequence, the Paris skyline seems to fold in upon itself, encapsulating ""reality"" into a self-contained cube.",1
"Just watch the trilogy, this film is a masterpiece",1
"This film is a profound impression of truth regarding friendship and solidarity. The men are simple folk who are enslaved by thugs like wardens and guards with one credo: you can battle the entire world but you never betray a friend. We learn what happens to friends, to foes and the principles of a man's life, The film is about relationships; the many years a man spends away from society and garners new friends. The film, like life and memories, unfolds in non-linear fashion. The director's cuts are interesting and each scene is beautifully amplified . The story is not told deceptively. Instead, the chapters of the story are revealed like pieces of a great jigsaw puzzle. Each delicious piece might make us laugh or cry or smile or feel hatred for the racist 'man'. This film is a true masterpiece, expressing a profound statement about friendship and betrayal, with fantastic acting, writing, directing and music.",1
"This movie is by far one of the best movies of the 90's. It has everything: A fantastic story, amazing actors, a killer soundtrack and one of the most amazing twists in modern movie history. It has that special, undefinable feeling to it, which makes it a movie to remember forever. If you read the book, you will probably notice that it is a quite short book. Besides from a couple cuts and the end, the movie actually follows the book very well. It is not a book filled with loads and loads of action as much as it an view point on modern society, and how we live out our lives. Kind of a long essay. David Fincher seems to share Chuck Palahniuk view on the western civilization today. Fincher has captured the special vibe and critique in Palahniuks book and works brilliantly. Fincher has added an element of humor to the story, which it is not obvious in the book. But it works very well. The end of the book is much more dark than the end of the movie, but it does not matter. Fincher has not made typical ""Hollywood ending"", and when a director does that it is always liberating. This movie is dark, exciting, funny, unique, inspiring and fascinating. I would like to end by writing: If you liked movies like......and then namedrop a couple of movies, which resembles it, but it is impossible. This movie is UNIQUE.",1
"I gave the first Christian Bale Batman movie a 9 and was looking forward to at least as good a film with the second installment. Heath Ledger gave an astounding performance, worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination. I can't remember sitting in a theater where everyone was dead still. No cell phones, no popcorn-munching, just everyone mesmerized by Heath's performance. It is my personal favorite movie performance of all time. That being said, the rest of the movie was a minor disappointment. Christian, Morgan, Michael and Gary gave very good performances, the rest - Maggie, Aaron, Eric - were superfluous roles and I thought detracted from the film. I enjoyed the serious dark nature of the film, and continue to have high hopes for the future films. This film was just too long and muddled, and should have focused on the Batman and Joker characters. Then you would have had 10.",1
Cinematic perfection. This movie continues to give me more insight as an audience member the more i revisit it. Beautifully layered characters pinned against a hard pessimistic world really creates a contrast that builds to a wonderfully hopeful finale.,1
"I love this movie son much. It ages well
And have a great cast.",1
"In this new age of superhero movies' box office domination, we've been treated to the good, the bad, and the ugly, the cool, the silly, and the utterly enjoyable- then along came the new Batman series. Batman Begins redefined the limits of what we thought superhero movies could achieve. With The Dark Knight, director Christopher Nolan has done something even more incredible: He's created an instant classic. Huge in scope, fully realized in story, and amazing in entertainment value, The Dark Knight is an honestly fantastic film. From the very first action sequence we can tell that we are leaps and bounds ahead of the predecessor. The Dark Knight deals with things so realistic, so intense that I would be quick to say that it's not even a kids movie. It becomes so much more than a superhero movie, digging so much deeper into the human mind, and emerges as a thought-provoking, incredible masterpiece. Yet it still retains that superhero charm.The film-making is all extraordinary. Nolan shows himself to be a master of suspense and storytelling. The screenplay is so smart and so quick that you might not catch everything even after several viewings, but it all still somehow works together perfectly. And the cast is perfect, particularly the incredible Heath Ledger. It would be a lie to say this film could have been what it is without him. His performance as the maniacal, anarchic Joker is the stuff of legend; it will haunt you long after the credits roll.The Dark Knight is the movie of the year. It is a masterpiece, and a blockbuster that mesmerized people like no film has in a long time. It deserves to be remembered forever. 9/10 stars!Jay Addison",1
Definitely a 10/10! I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends!,1
"How did you get here? Do you remember? If you don't, than you may be in a dream. Inception was movie where a thief journeys into the minds of important people and steals important information. The thief and his comrade hire a new recruit, considering the last one sold them out, as they try to complete the hardest task they have. Inception. When you watch the film, you will understand. Maybe. This is a film you may have to watch twice, in all honesty. I have seen it thousands of times and still feel weary on my understanding. If you love Jo-Go-Lev(Joseph Gordon Levitt) or Leo, than there is a 99 percent chance, you will love Inception.

"More than a movie. Many thanks to Mr. Murphy for the thoughtful review of ""Fight Club."" I am a Presbyterian pastor and my brother Jim is the editor of Fight Club. Being 46 years old, female, Christian, I didn't think the movie was going to have much to say to me, but I trusted Jim's choice that it was a movie worth working on. I too was very surprised and pleased to find it had a sophisticated message, not to mention great production values. Thanks for a review that wasn't just a knee-jerk response to the title and the violence. I hope others like you will have the courage to think about the implications of this film, and let them inform you as you work for the Kingdom.",1
"This is the best movie I've seen this year, hands down.  If the critcs disagree, ignore them.  Half of them label Edward Norton's character as ""Jack"", which is completely incorrect -- Jack is a reference to a book, not Norton's name.  Anyhow, the point is that Fight Club is an amazingly crafted vehicle for some realistic sentiments on the life of today's 20 year old men.  I don't expect the film to be embraced by all, but defintiely recommend people to see it to judge for themselves.",1

"This is _very_ black. In some ways quite brilliant, but not for the faint-hearted. Everything in the film is understated, even though it's taken to extremes. Nothing is introduced that isn't used later on. And it's so , so , black - did I mention that? However, add to that blackness a genuine humour that makes it stand even above the peak of the Coen brothers' black humour (Blood Simple and Fargo, for example).",1
"The 1999 film Fight Club is a psychological dramatic thriller that was directed by David Fincher and is based on the book of the same name. The film revolves around a nameless narrator, played by Edward Norton, who is a material-obsessed, office working, insomniac in desperate need of a change of lifestyle. That change comes when he meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, the eccentric soap maker who is everything the narrator wishes he could be. Together they form an underground fight club which slowly evolves into something much bigger, to the point where it becomes out of our protagonist's control.Before I watched this movie for the first time, I was skeptical that it would just be another run-of-the-mill action movie with not much deep thinking and lots of violence. What I wasn't expecting, was a thought-provoking, funny, dramatic, psychological thriller. But that's exactly what this movie is, and I loved every minute of it. Fight Club will keep you hooked for over two hours as it takes you through the narrator's journey from being your typical everyman to becoming the ringleader of his own group of anarchists. All while providing interesting insights into what humans really desire in life.While Edward Norton's portrayal of our mostly clueless protagonist is very good in its own right, Brad Pitt really steals the show here. His performance as Tyler Durden is highly entertaining and his cool guy attitude adds a lot of personality to the film. Helena Bonham Carter also does a great job in her role as the not-so-innocent Marla Singer. Overall, these characters are very dynamic and are expertly performed by these actors/actresses.The best part of the film would have to be the big twist at the end. Not only because it is a genuinely surprising moment, but also because it makes the film that much more incredible upon second viewings. If you re-watch this movie you be able to pick up on so much more after knowing what the twist is. It just makes the writing seem that much more clever when you watch it again.This movie has it all; captivating acting, an intriguing story, brutal action, excellent special effects, a great soundtrack, and many twists and turns all the way to the very end. I would strongly recommend watching this movie, and then watch it again, and again, and again, so you can truly appreciate the greatness of this film.",1
"I was never a fan of the batman comics or the cartoons but found batman begins extremely entertaining and certainly did revive the franchise. The dark knight was good but again over-hyped due to mainstreams movie viewers saying its best movie ever so they look cool. Im sure there's a lot of you out there calling this the best movie ever who said the same thing about transformers, transformers 2, pirates of Caribbeans etc. Those people really need to stop because it does not make you look or sound intelligent or have good taste at all.Let me start with the pros. The designs in this film is top notch, from the batman armor to the bat mobile and particularly the joker. Some of the stuns were actually pretty good also (eg. Kinapping Asian mob accountant from hong Kong. Christian bale who is one of my favorite actor was good enough, not brilliant, just good enough. The joker played by ledger was funny and at the same time repulsive. For instance when he interrupted the mob meeting, placed a pencil on the table and said ""you wanna see a magic trick?"" and preceded to smashing a bodyguard's head into the pencil. It was a very nice touch and established the jokers personality earlier on.OK, now onto the bad stuffs. Aaron Eckhart was never my favorite actor and again this film reminded me why. Its not the fact that he cant act but you can never quite take him serious enough, which is bad in a movie as dark as this.. The only annoying thing i found about him was his voice when he is batman, i know he is trying to hide his identity but the growling was just overdone at times.Also, the story was Way too long, very choppy with some elements completely unnecessary, like the bombs on the 2 ferries at the end. And whats with batman and getting his ass kicked by dogs, i mean hes got all these Fancy gadgets but doesn't even have some sort of taser to deal with the dogs? instead he rolled around on the ground looking like an idiot while the joker hit him with a steel pipe doing no damage at all. Hardly good actions in my opinion.In conclusion, The dark knight is an OK action film with its shares of good and bads. But as always its the story development and length which stopped it from becoming a great film like its predecessor. That being said, it is certainly a decent rent worth its money just don't believe the hypes and 10/10 comments by these hypocrites.",1
"One of the best movies ever. This one never gets old. Tim Robbins is my favorite actor and was before this movie. This movie is one of his best. His other classic favorite of mine is Jacobs Ladder. Love the development of the characters in the movie. Each one is his on and adds to the movie. Very good script, very original, clever. I wish he would have won the Oscar for this movie. I also wish Morgan Freeman would have won as well. Another point that was made in this movie that sticks, is how when you have done the same thing for so long, you don't know how to not do it. Point was made and shown several times by different actors. Love this quote: She was beautiful. God I loved her. I just didn't know how to show it.",1
"I think the problem is that the movie tried to provide a more realistic and less comic-book rendering of its characters, but couldn't escape the fact that it was still a summer popcorn comic-book blockbuster. Batman Begins did an excellent job of ""humanizing"" the Batman, IMO. In this movie, Batman was about as human as cardboard and all the efforts at humanizing the characters apparently went into the villains.Ledger's Joker had his moments although for what it may be worth I didn't feel it was the Oscar material the newsfeeds are buzzing about. It seems to me that his Joker- or at least, the movie's Joker, since I do not know how much of this is Nolan's conception- tries to both personify the ""wild card"" symbol of his name while humanizing that symbol. As someone with a high tolerance for abstraction in the cinema (and comicbooks), this dual-effort seemed to me to contradict itself at times, supplying an implicitly mundane human backstory to the villain while explicitly ""telling"" (rather than showing) the audience that this is ""The Joker"" - The Wildcard, The Reasonless Criminal, etc. While this type of juxtaposition might work, in this particular instance it seemed as though the very elements Nolan chose to de-emphasize as unnecessary backstory were the same sorts of elements which worked so well at humanizing (and making more realistic) the Batman in Batman Begins. Perhaps Ledger's genius lay in doing such a good job at intimating the Joker's ""humanity"" in spite of this.With Harvey Dent, we are presumably supposed to be disturbed by his moral decline, but this seemed rendered moot by the apparent moral superiority displayed by Gotham's citizenry at the end of the movie in itself deserving of a WTF? The people clearly don't need Dent as a shining beacon and Batman and Gordon may as well pack up and go home in this new City of Light that is Gotham. In Burton's Gotham the citizens scrambled over each other to pick up the Joker's dollar bills. In the Dark Knight, the Joker doesn't need dollar bills (as he makes abundantly clear) and they probably wouldn't do him any good anyhow. Instead of a criminal mastermind, the Clown Prince of Crime, he is the next step in the evolution of Gotham's criminal psyche, a surfer on a wave, his henchmen motivated not by money or fear or greed but by a primal awe and respect. Yet his progression is not linear, he is not merely the most evolved of the criminals, nor merely a psychopath, but a psychopath and criminal, combining to form something new to both these classes, presumably, in Gotham. Which sort of negates the premise of a city which required a Dark Knight to begin with, one which prior to the Joker contained moral citizens and orderly, predictable criminals.Nolan seems to have separated Gotham from context in his Batman universe, to the point where, in the Dark Knight, Gotham itself is thrown away, ignored like a piece of ligament cut from meat. And yet, the context which creates the Batman, the Joker, Two-Face, and all Gotham's denizens is elevated to a position of primacy at odds with this slight. This is a character-driven Batman world with no room, it seems, for the atmosphere so richly captured by previous incarnations. The main characters arise in a generic every-city which provides nothing unavailable outside the Gotham of legend, and the viewer can only identify the characters inasmuch as they reflect off of each other. Chaos is juxtaposed against order in this Batman far more than good against evil.Whether this ""works"" is up to the viewer, but personally, again, I like a bit of symbolism and I have no problems seeing the old-school Gotham City as a close reflection of the world I live in- and as a result kind of miss the atmosphere evoked in previous movies by its Gothamized depiction. (Maybe it helps I live in NYC. One can't help but feel that this movie may have been an attempt in some ways to ""globalize"" the franchise ) I feel I need to re-view the movie, solely to further examine Ledger's Joker. I may be missing something, confusing a contradiction with a contrast or not getting the ""point"" (or rather, pointlessness) of his crimes . This is definitely to Ledger's credit, that his character was so complex, and his performance was the hilight of the film. But its also because I grew pretty bored of the confusing and lacklustre action sequences which took up so much space between Joker appearances and as a result wasn't paying as close attention as I should have been each time there was some Joker or Joker-related dialogue.So, perhaps some of Ledger's moments aside, there was only one really, truly dark thing about the film and that was the cinematography, which made fight scenes look blurry and hard to follow, and seemed like a cheap way of ""rectifying"" problem number 1, above, by providing some kind of presumably ""gothic"" look to the city (at least during night-time.) All in all, 2 hours of generic action fare which failed to live up to either the movie's hype or its predecessor, interspersed with about half an hour's worth of a decent and worthy performance by one actor. And also, the Watchmen preview.",1
"Yeah what a luck, my friends and I went to an OV sneak and awaiting a boring love ""sucks"" film like Romeo and Julia or something similar.So we were 2 minutes to late.First surprise : UIIII an action movie bank robbery 'n'stuff, no ""love boat"".Second surprise : Hey its kinda stupid and brutal enough to entertain me for this evening.third and last surprise : why did the bank robber face looks like..... JOKER o0 ?!?!?!?!Wonderful 5 Euros paid for a movie i booked(and paid) cards weeks ago for 8,50 euro.I saved 3,50 Euros WOOOHAAAA!!... wait a minute???? Aaaah who cares enjoy the movie!OK what could i say to it?Its really good. For me its the best movie i saw this Year and its more as i expected. After the great first try with Batman begins i wonder if they can top this.I like Ledger and how he act as Joker. Bad, psycho and funny! Alone for this, the movie was not worse the money. And i like how he gets his scars, not because of a crappy acid bath or something similar. Thats the kind of realism why i like the new batman movies more as the old ones (except one and two).Even that Batman try to mask his real voice is something i find really good. OK it won't help much in real world but alone the idea behind it is good. And its funny i must always laugh when Batman is speaking.Dark parts of the movie : This sonar UBER thing...sorry but....a way to UBER. and this crappy Motorbike and the wall scene....no sorry a NO GO. My greatest misgiving was, that they try to overload it with Batman ""Toys"". Batman Bike, Batman Spaceshuttle, Batman self destruction super mini atom ""only in a 50 meter radius"" bomb or things like that but they didn't thanks god.But down to this two things it was a great movie for fans and freaks a must, for semi fans like me a nice enjoyable movie.P.S.: Don't cheat yourself with the German translated version!! Watch it FIRST as original at an OV Cinema near you. Ledger and his original voice as Joker is great. This mood(feeling) cannot be translated.",1
This movie is going to end up on the all time list of it hasn't already. Morgan Freeman was fantastic. As was All the other actors. I could watch this movie over and over. I'm not sure that anyone who rated this movie poorly is even human. It's a great story of struggle and overcoming obstacles.,1
"I am not able to go into full detail on a review for Inception as it is 1:30am but after seeing it I HAD to log in to mention a couple of things that made this one of the best movies I have ever seen. Originality. Something that is lacking far too much in Hollywood. Between sequels and re-makes I cannot remember the last truly ""original"" screenplay I have witnessed...maybe Memento! Cerebral. I hate to sound snobbish and I do love mindless fun films as well, yet it was so great to watch a movie that really made you think, and think deeply. The Ending. What really happened there? Who Cares?! It is up to the individual or group of friends to discuss. I love that. It really doesn't have a concrete answer. Good. The visuals. Not so much for the city scenes you see in the previews but little things, such as a fight scene with a hallway flipping around or a brief staircase paradox. I actually enjoyed them more than anything from the Matrix. Maybe it was that they were more subtle. The overall complexity was refreshing where too many movies come out that spoon feed the audience. I have read many reviews tonight and I am thoroughly enjoying reading everyone's take on the ending or the movie as a whole. Most people are writing short novels with their own take on it. How many movies have done that lately? I have to admit my favorite part was in the parking lot after hearing the poor girl to her boyfriend conversation ""I don't understand it"" ""Yeah, I didn't think you would"" ouch",1
"Christopher Nolan has done it again. He has created an amazing movie that is unique, brilliant, and mind blowing. The concept of the movie is really interesting and the story does not disappoint. The cast is outstanding and perfectly casted for their roles. Leo did an amazing job as the lead character and we really get to know his struggles and demons as the movie progresses. The special effects are very good too and don't overtake the story or characters. I could understand why everyone does not agree with the high rating this movie received since the movie is so original and unique, people might consider it just stupid. However, those who appreciate great filming will not be disappointed. I highly recommend seeing this movie.",1
"Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again. Does the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly: If they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff ""Batman"" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of ""Two-Face."" This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie. I struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film.",1
"Another master piece of Christopher Nolan. Nolan's screenplay, which he worked on for nearly a decade, keeps the audience on a leash that is expertly loosened and tightened throughout, allowing us sometimes to predict what's coming and other times ramping up the suspense so that we can't imagine how the team will make it out alive. The greatest accomplishment is providing stakes for the dream worlds. Inception constantly invites you to marvel in expertise, both that of the characters and the filmmakers themselves-- Wally Pfister's camera work, Hans Zimmer's score, Chris Corbould's visual effects are all unparalleled and utilized beautifully. It is a masterpiece and a great background theme too..",1
This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.,1
"When I first saw the trailers for Inception, I was very excited about a movie not based on yet another super hero! The previews had me impatient to see this new thriller, and when it opened, I was there the first night.At first, it took a little bit of ""brain-work"" to get it all, but as the movie progressed, I was more and more in awe of this original and compelling work. I am always excited to see something that makes me work at appreciation, if you know what I mean. When you see it, you need to go in with an open mind.While there were some similarities to the Matrix, it was easy to dismiss. With all the extraordinary special effects, Inception is clearly very original in its own right.While I have never been a huge fan on Leonardo, I must say that he did a great job and had a very supportive cast that kept me entertained 2 hour plus adventure.If you are worried you will not understand it, or get it, and have heard others mention how lost they were, take it from me - go see it for yourself or get it on DVD and see one of the most original movies in recent memory.",1
"OK, let's be clear... so amazing! so incredible! so absolutely EXCELLENT...The problem is... (are) 1. where does he get the Psychoes to do his bidding and how do they ""stick to the plan"" if they're ""psycho""? 2. How does he get all the ""gasoline/explosive material"" EVERYWHERE w/o anyone seeing? 3. I look forward to the DVD which takes an extra hour and explains these ""faults"" so that I can say: ""This is, without a doubt, the most brilliant piece of film ever to come out of Hollywood. BRAVO!!!With all that said and ""out of the way"", I found myself enjoying this film immensely and look forward to seeing it again, in the very near future in the theaters!!!",1
"I've read few 1 star rated comments of FC and I got amazed how people who dislike this movie enjoy trashing and insulting people that find it masterpiece... I didn't like it at all first time I've seen it and if I knew about IMDb then, I'll surely give it 2-3 stars. But when I've seen it for the second time (even if I wasn't keen of it, friend made me) _ all bits and pieces came in their places and I've realized that this is the best movie ever made. Unlike most movies today, this one makes you think. You may enjoy it without being anarchist, whore, drug addict, uneducated, aggressive, neo Nazi and everything else that caring 1star givers classified us. It's their problem they want from movie to be linear, classical thriller, to have logical plot, believable characters etc. It's their problem that only conclusion they can come up with is that ""this will make stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain"" or ""it portrays sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and attempts to make it seem intelligent; instead of what it is insanity"". If it isn't sad, it would be funny...People can't make difference between satire and critics on the one side and glorification on the other side... Fight club is wonderful and poignant critics of the world today and 8.8 rating tells me that most of the people got it right. For all the others _ too bad for you that you're not able to see it's excellence...",1

"This movie shows us a different side of dreaming. Most of us take our dreams for granted and don't think they are that important. But the truth is that many ideas are born within our dreams. Inception shows us that our subconscious could be most vulnerable during our sleep. Planting a small idea in the deepest layers of our mind can have a massive impact on our daily choices. In the movie we see that some minds are ""trained"" to know when someone else is invading their dream. This has a big resemblance with the practice of lucid dreaming. (being aware of your dream) Sometimes with lucid dreaming it can happen that you have false awakenings. You think you woke up, but you're actually still dreaming. This phenomenon is shown within Inception as layers of subconscious that each have their own passage of time. What I missed within this movie is the fact that everything is possible within our dreams. Any lucid dreamer can take hold of their own dreams and make anything happen. (like flying) Maybe that's something that could be explored within a sequel?",1
"Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller might well have been called 'Deception', or better still, 'Multiple Deception', such is the effect the film has. The concept is original, no question. However, it does borrow from classic American films such as 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Matrix'.Many film geeks _ and ordinary punters _ have described this film as 'very complicated'. The truth is it's just tremendously detailed. For his job, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), while in a dream state, steals ideas from people ('Extraction'); however, the film concerns itself with him implanting an idea into a person's mind, i.e. 'Inception'. That's the plot in one crude line.However, to reduce the plot, which took a modern master nearly eight years to flesh out, to one purely about mental thievery would be unfair. It is the minutiae which are meant to dazzle.Business tycoon, Saito (Ken Watanabe) needs Cobb to perform the inchoate process of Inception on another businessman's son, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), to prevent his father's energy company from becoming a monopoly. After Fischer Snr passes, it is believed that he will betroth the business to his son, so the idea Cobb and his team must implant is for him to repudiate his father's will.The technology used to carry out the subconscious subterfuge is never explained. When we catch glimpses of it, it looks like a child's primitive science-kit thrown into a briefcase. But this is not meant to be the focus.For all its cerebral conceit, at the film's core are two emotional stories. One is of Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who spends her time stalking Cobb's subconscious mind and thereby sabotaging his missions. The other is between Fischer and his father, whose relationship is strained.We saw DiCaprio mature in Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Here he permanently loses the schoolboy image and becomes a man. The ensemble acting is good, however, most of the main characters seem far too young to do anything let alone steal and implant ideas, and Michael Caine's turn as yet another sage is fast becoming trite.The computer-generated imagery is, as expected, top-notch, though the action scenes would be clichéd if they were not embellished by Hans Zimmer's superbly suspenseful music.Ultimately, Nolan asks us to absorb too much gobbledegook too quickly. Perhaps he was being pretentious, perhaps not. Either way, I lost interest somewhere in the second half.Within days of the film's release, thousands of cinema-goers cast their votes on this venerated website, ensuring that the film became, at least in their minds, one of the top five greatest films of all time. So much for polls.www.scottishreview.net",1

"Soap, mischief, mayhem, movie making genius. Once again, Hollywood has proven that the Oscar's do not mean crap. Fight Club is the soap that cleanses theaters of such ""high tech"" garbage as Independence Day and such unreal garbage as American Beauty (want to see a real disturbing look at society, try the Ice Storm). Fight Club is blend of surreal images, moody backdrops, viewer/narrator interaction, incredible music,dark humor, and soap. Just the opening sequence alone (perhaps the best ever, giving new meaning to ""in medias res"") will cause you to salivate like a rabid canine. Oh, I did mention this is a political film? Anyways, the premise seems simple enough. The narrator of the film, who we will call ""Jack,"" is an insomniac trapped in a dead-end, worker bee, corporate job. The only other important aspect of Jack's life is his condo filled with clever art, Swedish furniture, and a refrigerator full of condiments. That is, until Jack meets Tyler Durden, an eccentric fellow he meets on an air plane. Jack soon learns that Tyler is full of ""useful information."" There are two insanely glorious scenes that take place during and after his meeting with Tyler. Once scene involves a new look at airline emergency manuals and the other involves a hilarious look at dildos and vibrating luggage-- not to be missed. Anyways, enough about the plot. The film is one big Goodyear blimp full of anti-corporate messages and the lie of the ""so-called information age."" In fact, it find it totally amazing this film even made it to theaters! The same corporate mush heads who the film admonishes are the same people who finance this picture (the fine people at Fox, ""when corporate scumbags attack!! Next on Fox.) This is,however, the same reason Fight Club hopped in and out of the theater and failed to gain ol' Oscar's attention. In fact, if you see the trailers for the movie, it looks like ""See Brad Pitt fight, see Brad Pitt take off his shirt, see Fight Club."" They tried to sell the movie for everything it wasn't. The movie is a sharp, brutally honest, social commentary, and the acting was phenomenal. Ed Norton is incredible as always, and Brad Pitt plays Tyler to perfection. They originally thought of casting Sean Penn as Tyler, but believe me only Brad could have pulled this one off. Fight Club, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich are three films that have raised my expectations of film making; they are what Hollywood should be. But of course like any film with a message, with intelligent writing, that makes people think and question ends up in the La Brea Tar pit of Hollywood. So until Oscar finds the many creative uses of soap (watch the film), it is up to you to discover what great movie making is all about.",1

If you were raised on a steady diet of MTV and cable TV, you'll love the dark images and wild editing.  I'm buying the DVD just to watch it all over again, it looks that good.But the story is what got me.  The plot twist towards the end woke me up and had me freaked out.

"as Carlfo Said.Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.",1

One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.",1

"Goonies is a never ending series of very loud, annoying and preposterous situations that will have you rolling your eyes more than a Felix the Cat clock. First and foremost, the continuous dialog and general noise in this movie is enough to make it a form of torture. The audio is pegged at 10 from the opening and never once lets up. Secondly, the gaps in reality: it's just a kids film you say? Movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars intelligently made a kids genre entertaining. Ditto to The Bad News Bears, Home Alone or anything Walt Disney Produced. This film bashes you over the head with every cliché and impossible situation imaginable. The characters are all one dimensional and unimaginative, most all of them have an adult wit and a snappy response for every thing posed to them like a kid from a bad sitcom, and I cannot stress this enough, all of them talk nonstop, mostly simultaneously, for the entire film.",1
"It is the best movie I have ever seen. The performance of the cast and the direction is just so amazing that u will never know what to expect. The jokes are funny. The movie is very entertaining and you cannot stay without talking about it. It keeps you guessing till the end and most of the people including me didn't know what would come.You cannot say that a scene after brad pit's entry was boring. But appreciation not only goes to him but to all the other actors as well. Both Brad pit and Edward Norton do a wonderful job and take the movie to another level. I loved this movie the first time I watched it, now i've seen it more than 6 times and i still love it and want to watch it. The music was also good and the acting was the best. A must watch movie!!!!",1
"Have you ever remembered of your dreams? Already controlled them? Built things and had everything you ever wanted by just dreaming? If not, ""Inception"" will teach you how! ""Inception"" can be the best work of Nolan since ""The Dark Knight"". Handing over a film that needs a lot of intellectual capacity to understand it and love it completely. But thanks to great writing of Nolan, it doesn't need to burn any brain cells. As I said, the construction of the film goes beyond the limit of fantastic.Everything in the film works at a fantastic pace, the story itself is made of a tremendous geniality. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ""extractor"" who works in extracts memories and ideas from the minds of people while they sleep through their dreams. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), a murder that he didn't committed and still been haunted by the memory of Mal in his dreams. But Cobb gets a new job that can guarantee his returning back home with a clean record. A job offered by Saito (Ken Watanabe) a old target of one of Cobb's works (which ran pretty bad), which offers an almost impossible job to perform, instead of extracting Cobb will have to implement an idea in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the economic rival of Saito. For that Cobb will have to join the best teams to help him get back home.The story seems confusing, but Nolan explores it with an amazing intelligence, presenting very intelligent and realistic arguments of how dreams work and how we can control them. And at the same time how they are connected with our mind, building the film by every minute that passes with amazing dialogs making it more fantastic. But not only intellectuality of Nolan that stands out in the film. His direction is nothing bad at all.Many compare ""Inception"" to ""The Matrix"" because of the action scenes and the intellectuality from start to finish but both movies have completely different ideas and especially the action scenes. While Matrix has bullet-time with Kung Fu moves, Inception gives superb action sequences, as they can be realistic and always be connected to the world of dreams. The direction of ""Inception"" is without limits ranging from fantastic to dazzling, thanks also to the PERFECT visual effects that create entire worlds.In the film we also have one most breath-taking soundtracks that the master Hans-Zimmer once again delivers, fantastic and diversified songs that fit perfectly in every scene, and all of them really well connected with dreams.""Inception"" is not only the best of Nolan, but also one of the most well made films ever created, thanks to superb performances (especially DiCaprio), a fantastic screenplay and stunning visual effects, ""Inception"" is an intellectual journey and purely fun which brings us to the world of dreams. One of the best movies of this generation with no doubt.",1
Amazing Film! I thought the film told a realistic story while also adding great acting thought out the film.,1
"What makes the Dark Knight special in the (very large) pantheon of action-blockbusters is the way it all fits together.Here we have a very large, very dense two-villain comic-book story told in such a smooth, inter-related way that when the second villain finally emerges it feels entirely natural, as if that character could exist in no other way.We have the anarchist-Joker, who could have been a typically psychotic antagonist, taken to such a surreal extreme that he jumps right over ""crazy"" and lands on ""evil."" Yet the character never seems artificial or one-note. This Joker comes from nowhere, seemingly fully formed, an all-powerful super-villain, almost omniscient, practically teleporting, seemingly invincible, and still he somehow feels like a real person.The film's main theme is terrorism, a rather thin-ice topic, but its approached in an honest and non-judgmental way that I found tremendously refreshing. Nothing is heavy-handed or preachy, nor is there any clear moral or conclusion. The thematic elements are subtle but present, and you the viewer are left to construct your own message, which is exactly how it should be done in a film aimed at adults.But it's still a blockbuster, and that's right too. Steps are taken to bring realism to Batman's world, but the character's comic-book origins are not forgotten or discarded. Batman and the Joker are, without explanation, super-powered, which is after all what we came to see.If there's any real flaw it's that the action scenes are rather ho-hum compared to the drama. Only the car chase is memorable (despite being confusing spatially) and even that wouldn't make anyone's top-5. That this weakness isn't more disastrous (or even particularly consequential) in an action film shows just how good the whole really is.Because in the end, it all just clicks. You get the feeling that what you watched was complete, and that nothing could or should have been different. Of course it's not perfect -- nothing is -- but fewer mistakes were made here than in any other action movie I can think of. This is what all blockbusters should aspire to be.",1
"Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment.",1
"A masterpiece , full of hope . inspiring and not like any other prison movie !
i watched it when I was 19 , my english was not good , so I watched it again yesterday I'm 23 now and I'm so happy that I gave myself another chance to watch it .",1
"There's a reason this is rated the #1 . It is the same reason you simply watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if it's already half way over. It's captivating, brilliant and full of heart.",1
"""The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about."" The first hour and a half of the film is slightly bland and lengthy, but the last hour with its various showdowns, reversals and reveals is very refreshing and overwhelming, with the climax lasting until the last second of the film.",1
"One thing's for sure: comic book based movies are here to stay. Once before they were B-movie, red headed stepchildren with very miniscule budgets and low grade actors, now these films regularly attract A-list talent both in front and behind the camera. The latest in this summer comic book slate is THE DARK KNIGHT, the sequel to the well received and awesomely successful Batman reboot BATMAN BEGINS and continues right where it left off.Where the first movie dealt with the origins of how and why Batman came to be, this sequel now moves onto a larger canvas: the storyline now revolves around the consequences of Batman's appearance in a city gripped by crime and hopelessness. With the demise of former mob boss Carmine Falcone's power in Gotham City, the various crime syndicates are now leaderless and trying to reconsolidate as Batman (Christian Bale) AKA billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne continues his relentless assault to restore order. In the first film director Chris Nolan portrayed Gotham as a sort of cross between the slums of Hong Kong and Chicago of the Al Capone era with lots of rain and gloom, now Gotham is depicted as being very similar to New York, with many massive high rises and somewhat sunnier skies, it seems Gotham is literally coming back to life.But even with new fearless district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart in his best role to date), it seems the city is just a few steps ahead of the rising tide of criminality that is beginning to strike back against its newfound heroes and it manifests itself into a new and powerful adversary called the Joker (Heath Ledger in his final film role). I have always found that the main differences between the main comic book makers Marvel and DC is in the portrayal of their heroes- whereas Marvel superheroes tend to be average guys and gals who are thrust with superpowers and lots of responsibility, DC superheroes tend to be iconic representations of the human condition: Superman is a depiction of the ideals and greatness of mankind while Batman represents vigilantism and revenge. As the plot of the movie unfolds, the forces of law and order, represented by Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman once again reprises his role and it has been expanded considerably) and Harvey Dent, battle it out on the streets of Gotham city against the forces of criminality with mob bosses Eric Roberts and Michael Jai White (yes, the SPAWN guy is here too) allied with chaos and anarchy which is represented by the Joker with Batman the vigilante smack dab in the middle of it all. Despite Batman being on the side of order, his very methods create a copycat gang of vigilantes who style themselves after him which puts the city even closer to the brink. As all the swirling plot lines culminate into one big showdown, Batman must make his choices carefully as every action he takes creates unintended and sometimes tragic consequences.The last great movie I saw since last year was NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN but I can say that THE DARK KNIGHT finally gives me a satisfaction that I had been missing for over a year now. The acting is superb with many old faces returning- Morgan Freeman is homely as Lucius Fox while Oldman has a larger role and consequently gets to shine even further. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes is an infinitely better actress than her predecessor (though I thought Katie Holmes looked sexier even though she had zero talent) but her role is somewhat subdued and we never got more into her character. Christian Bale is adequate for the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne though he doesn't seem to put in anything new to the character (I still think Micheal Keaton was the best movie Batman). The big question is obviously on Heath Ledger and he delivers a deliciously wicked and sadistic Joker- very similar to Jack Nicholson's take on the character and that's a compliment; my only peeve is that he wasn't given a permanent smile like the previous Jokers in the movie and comic book- slightly different take but still very, very entertaining and fits in well with Nolan's more realistic version of the venerable Bat franchise. It is sad that Ledger will never be able to reprise his role and his makeup seems so similar to that of the equally late Brandon Lee in THE CROW that the parallels are eerie. Unlike the past incarnations of the movie and cartoon Jokers, Ledgers performance has transformed the Joker from a villain with a smile on his face into anarchy incarnate- he is no longer just a bad guy but a force of nature. The big surprise here is Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent- he steals every scene he is in and watching his fall from grace is like seeing that of an epic Shakespearean tragedy.Terrific action sequences and nail biting suspense adds to an epic sequel: 8 out of 10.",1
This movie is arguably one of the best Batman movies ever. The villain was well done and definitely is memorable.,1
"Inception is undoubtedly, a clear cut exemplification of my definition of an idealistic cinema. The stupendous Nolan touch coupled with the flawless performance by the cast and crew, makes it an unforgettable and unparalleled movie experience. Right from the very beginning, each and every tiny detail, leaves you flabbergasted and pondering about the potential hints left lying on every turn it takes.Words fall short every time I try to come up with a description for this movie. Everything about it is just perfectly in place and the fact that it is cognitively challenging is something that caught my eye.Inception is one of those movies which demands your unflinching attention for over 150 minutes of its duration and even beyond. The plot of the movie is assured to leave you puzzled, especially on your first watch and it's guaranteed to be more and more thought provoking, each time you watch it. The deeper you dig, the more amused you will be.I'm sure that nobody would be a stranger to the general theme around which the movie revolves. Even if you haven't had the chance to watch it, it is likely that you've come across its plot at some point.Coming down to the performance of the team, it would be unfair not to mention the vehemently magical execution delivered by its lead cast. It goes without mentioning how Leonardo DiCaprio has done justice to the role of the protagonist, Dom Cobb. The movie will surely be even sweeter, in case you happen to be a DiCaprio fanatic as well. Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy among the others have indisputably surpassed themselves.The genius of Mr. Nolan, which has been proven time and again, through his other remarkable works like Memento, The Dark Knight trilogy and Interstellar(though it came out after inception), is the heart and soul of the movie. It is an absolute wonder as to why he isnt an Academy Award recipient yet! The complexity of the plot, with its subtle nuances owing to its convolution, has been handled flawlessly and that's what makes me confidently assert that the movie couldn't have been in safer hands.
Although many might disagree, for me the best thing about Inception is the fact that its progression is very much hooked on to how you comprehend and perceive the details. The ambiguity in its conclusion, specifically drew my attention, although it's considered unjustified by the majority.Like every other thing, the movie has its own defaults. A major part of the audience might not be proficient enough to derive the complexity of the plot, particularly if you don't pay ample attention. Further, the fact that you need to be completely focussed throughout might be asking for too much, in the case of many.All things aside, the movie has been successful in incepting a wonderful idea, the most resilient parasite in the minds of its audience. It has pushed me to contemplate on the vast and endless possibilities of the human subconscious. For a moment you might as well think of there being alternate realities or might even have yourself question about the authenticity of the reality that we live in. For me, Inception is everything you could expect out of a movie and that is the very reason for it being placed at the top of my table of movie rankings. Being a hardcore Nolan fan as well as a DiCaprio fanatic, what more could you wish for?!",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation.Although it was a box office disappointment, the film received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu- ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition.[4] It is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".",1
"Honestly. I loved this movie solely because of the fact that it introduced a philosophical concept to a demographic that may have minimal knowledge on the subject (me). After reading the reviews I saw for people who said that this movie deserved 1 star I had 2 thoughts. 1. Why would you make it a 1? Did the movie offend you enough for you to discredit the quality of the film?2. I understand that dreaming and waking up continuously may be a confusing state of affairs although I have confidence that the major popularity knows how to put 2 and 2 together.There are many things wrong with the technology used in this film like: How could all of these people interact if they were dreaming through separate minds? Is there even a technology that can induce lucid dreams? How in the world did they construct the specific materialization of certain objects in these dreams?With all of these factors, the plot development was absolutely amazing, and I can safely say that I will be watching this again.",1
"Inception. What a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan has really outdone himself with this insane concept of people sharing the same dream space and exploring the idea of a 'dream within a dream'. With Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist, Cobb, he puts on a stunning performance, which leaves you speechless and in absolute awe of his uncanny film talent.The movie uses layers of dreams to build up the structure of the movie's plot line, transitioning between each one at alternate stages. With the idea being somewhat unrealistic, the film easily makes up for this through attracting viewers by ensuring that they are eager to uncover the mystery of its non-linear plot line.DiCaprio has a unique acting style that he commonly uses in all of his movies. Throughout Inception though, he slotted comfortably into the life of Cobb and conveyed his life both outstandingly and consistently. The way he expresses pain and emotional difficulties is very believable and he connects with the audiences while doing so. Nolan has put in an exceptional effort in the construction of his film. I recommend it over most films of its genre but to properly gain the most out of it and to completely understand the plot line, the viewer must be engaged constantly. It is worth seeing it twice, almost three times to grasp its general concept. This film's themes are also quite complex and thus, attract audiences who enjoy such themes. Personally, I would rate this film a solid 10 out of 10 for the exceptional effort put in by Nolan and for the elaboration on the central idea of the film, people sharing the same dream space.",1
"A few days ago, after a long time, I reviewed ""The Shawshank Redemption"", so I decided it was time to write my review. It may seem easy to review this film, defining it: beautiful or wonderful, but the truth is that they would not be quite exhaustive compliments. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is ""The Movie""; perfect from every point of view, the highest point that cinema can ever reach; raw, realistic, powerful, exciting! The plot is absolutely engaging and intriguing, keeping the viewer anxious until the end, making him experience unparalleled emotions, as if he were experiencing those of the characters themselves. The setting of the prison is masterly and completely immerses those who are watching the film. Not to mention the soundtrack, simply imposing. The presence of actors like: Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, puts the exclamation mark on this masterpiece allowing it to go down in history. So in conclusion I can not help but define this film as, perhaps, the best ever; and for those who had not yet looked at it ... Well, I think it's time to recover it, because you can't talk about cinema without having ever seen it. Greetings to all and see you at the next review.",1
"This is a legendary film. But each new time you look like the first. Everything is excellent here, starting with the play of actors and ending with music. If you have depression, then you need to watch this movie. He washes away all the bad.",1
"One of those bores that liked it before all the hoopla...remember getting to watch as I'd read the Stephen King short story in the collection of novella's* of which it was part (which I had only read as it contained the short story 'the Body' which was turned into my previous favourite film, Stand by Me) Upon watching what I thought was an astonishing film on video, I wondered why I hadn't heard of this being at the cinema or talked about....although I say that latter point now...it's probably something that has developed over time... much like the buzz for the film itself... I can say it remains to this day the only film that I have watched after reading the story, that is much better and more poignant than the book from which it came. The film itself is told in a great way and filmed brilliantly...not least captured by the character of the warden (depicting what were 3 in the novella). It is full of great supporting characters and turns and there are two brilliant male leads (they both should've have got an Oscar nomination with one of them winning!). It's a film where if I started writing about the components of, or scenes from, I could go on For longer than the film itself...(which despite its length never felt like a long movie!) So will just say that I'd recommend watching it to anyone. I've watched it copious times since first viewing and it never gets boring or do I seem to switch off when it's on...so a boring choice of favourite film, but it really is a great movie.10/10* the collection (4 seasons) of short stories also contains Apt Pupil, which is probably the best of the novella's but was turned into a pretty average movie!",1
"Its a movie about hope
Andy is an innocent man who was sent to Shawshank for the murder of his own wife. He had hope that he will get justice but the only thing he gets was time enough to break though the prison. He spent 19 years in the Shawshank prison but he never lost his hope.While Red is a man who was sent to Shawshank prison when he was a kid and he had no hope for his life outside of Shawshank. He thinks that Shawshank is his life and he will spend his rest of life in the prison but after he meets Andy his point of view changes.",1
"Great movie and a reality check for our consumer society, i don't like its one reference about god and religion, but its criticism of society and our values is entirely legitimate and worth watching over and over... definitely one of my favorite movies. If you like this movie you should also watch clockwork Orange, 12 monkeys, good will hunting, Amelie plain and others. I think one of the greatest things this movie successfully accomplishes is forcing the audience to reflect upon their own lives and take stock of their own goals and passions. the author is very clever in using some of his own experiences with looking hurt and society's narrow minded superficial judgment of people to create a master piece of modern times. I feel that as time goes by this movie will be placed with others such as clockwork orange and vanilla sky and cinematic eye openers and timeless classics.",1
"Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a dark, meticulously constructed masterpiece that weaves fantasy adventure into a complex crime saga, making for a groundbreaking superhero film.Featuring the best live-action portrayals of the titular superhero and his archenemy The Joker - as well as a plethora of strong supporting actors as iconic characters plucked straight from the comics - 'The Dark Knight' is perfectly cast. Christian Bale brings the right amount of arrogant charisma to Bruce Wayne while chiselling a formidable presence in costume as Batman, his gravelly voice laced with a determination that highlights the unshakable proponent of justice that he is.And Heath Ledger delivers an unforgettable,
Oscar-winning performance as the nameless Clown Prince of Crime; a menacing supervillain with a penchant for anarchy and unpredictability. The screenplay gives Ledger many memorable monologues, adding to the character's mystique and madness.If Christopher Nolan wasn't a well-known name before, then 'The Dark Knight' announced him as a force to be reckoned with in the film industry. His filmmaking style is well-suited to this dark and gritty entry in the superhero genre, with a refreshing emphasis on practical special effects. The cinematography and lighting are impressive throughout to showcase Gotham as the crime-riddled cityscape it is, full of corruption and violence; the perfect playground for The Joker to stage his brutal games and test Batman's heroic nature.Overall, 'The Dark Knight' is a staggering achievement in film that benefits from a superb cast, Nolan's masterful direction, and Hans Zimmer's typically powerful music to rank as one of the greatest films of all time.",1
"This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it. Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the local DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to myself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. ""One of the best movies ever"", my best friend said, ""My favorite movie in the whole wide world"", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll love this!!!",1
"The answer might be simple, but yes. ""Sorry, your review is too short"" IMDB says.Well, yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes may be not.",1
"Where do I begin? Hmmm, where can I describe how amazing this movie is. I really do not know how to tell the reader of this article without spoiling? Well, I am only going to ask the reader to take my word for it. Now, my reviews are not well received and dismissed as useless. I want to try to be as helpful as possible, I will make this review quick. I do not want to ramble on and on and bore the reader. I will state that I am a Christopher Nolan fan. In fact, I think he's on of the best filmmakers of all time. People told me it was too early to tell when Dark Knight came out but after viewing Inception, it proved my point. Inception is not only the best movie of the summer, the year, it's also one of the best movies ever made. It really is amazing, I can't even think of ONE flaw in it. It's really hard to describe the plot but I can throw this out there, it's very intelligent. It's a great story about dreams. It's like the Matrix with a hint of Memento. However, it's it's own movie and it's rich and original. It's also well acted. I also want to point out the obvious is the visuals. Man let me tell you, it is pretty to look at. Nolan manages to make pretty visuals without the need to use a lot of CGI. In fact, the movie hardly had any CGI it was pretty much all compositing with actual shot footage. Which in my opinion made the movie look more real. He manages to also make the movie trippy without going overboard. This is as far as I am going to tell about Inception I do not want to spoil anything. Plus, I am too tired to write a long review. I wanted to sum it up with a short review. I am sure nobody will find this article useful but meh, I just want to give out my opinion. If you like Blade Runner, Matrix and Nolan films in general, this is a great movie to check out. It will go in the history books as one of the best scifi movies. It's a must see on the IMAX, trust me on that one. Also, Nolan, he better get an Oscar. He seriously deserves one more than any filmmaker right now. He's magical and I don't think he knows how to make bad movies. He only knows epic and awesome. Thank you Christopher Nolan.",1
It's one of the movies you should see before you die,1
"Hard to know where to start, too much unnecessary gunfighting. Didn't really need explosions as the premise of the story is fascinating anyway - maybe the gunfire and explosions were for the younger members of the audience.Mr Nolan is a major talent and has great imagination. But trying to keep up with the dialogue was bloody difficult; really don't know how the young kids in the audience followed this.In the show I was watching you could feel the sense of giving up as after about an hour and a half of dreams/subconscious/mind/ dialogue plus a plot to try and unravel, the level of people talking and giggling started to crank up. My concentration level started to wain when they arrived at the snowy location - basically I threw in the towel.Yes, it was well made, great to look at, the music was brilliant, but even the ending lacked any emotional connection that the audience could make with L de C.You've basically got to see this film at least 3 times to eventually go ""Oh wow! I get it, what a film""",1
"Acting of heath ledger is very good,climax and twists are main plot",1
"In the spirit of full disclosure I am a Chris Nolan fan boy who was patiently awaiting this release for the last couple years. While it is an exceptional ground breaking film, it sadly did not live up to my expectations. An 8/10 from me is normally a very high compliment coming from me, as I've only given out a handful of 9's and 10's, but this is a movie that could have been so much more.I actually got very excited when I read some reviews here on IMDb suggesting parallel's to Paprika (or saying Nolan flat out ripped the movie off, actually according to Wikipedia this script has been in development for over a decade). Paprika's dream world was flat out insane and took multiple viewings to really dive into the nuances.The dream world in Inception, in my opinion, is all too real, while it deals with manufactured dreams I would expect a dream world to be riddled with contradictions and nonsense. I left the theater feeling like I got the entire movie, whereas going in I expected to leave in a daze eager for another viewing to try and figure things out. It's not often I want a movie to be less coherent and logical, but with the nature of the subject matter I really expected nothing less.That said this was a bold movie for mainstream Hollywood to make, there has never been anything like it shot in live action. The cast was phenomenal, not a single weak link. Even the extra's acted well. Ellen Page's performance really stuck out, she's on her way to becoming a super star.The cinematography was spectacular with even the few scenes dealing with dream-induced pseudo-reality seeming oddly real. What is amazing is that the movie was shot in analog and not digital, non-technical people may not grasp just how impressive that is. Nolan likes the higher film quality and I think the results speak for themselves.Nolan has delivered yet another groundbreaking top-250 hit and continues to expand a resume that is starting to challenge that of the likes of Kubrick and Hitchcock.",1
"This movie I have been see twice. And this is my first time see a movie twice. And this is my first time see IMAX film, too. Because some views are full screen. So I saw the movie all in IMAX theater. I afraid there has no this visual effect in DVD in the future.I always enjoy the movies that director is Christopher Nolan, like ""Memonto"", ""Batman Begins"", ""Pritage""... They all can see again and again. Every time I see, will have different feel~Although the movie is perfect, but I hope there has no sequel any more... it's enough. A: Because Heath Ledger was gone, I don't want to see any other guy to act as a substitute. B: TDK is a masterpiece. Its sequel very easy to be bad than TDK.",1
"Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to ""give him a handshake"". And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again.",1

"I was really hoping to be able to give this movie a much higher rating than this, because in the previews it looked great.I honestly feel a little cheated, because I think that this movie had tons of potential, and I do believe that when they were making it, they probably saw it, but for one reason or another, it was lost.",1
"This film is absolutely RIVETING! From beginning to end it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Everything from the acting of Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, to the inspiring mind of Christopher Nolan will leave you in awe. Not to forget the endless chills that are set down your spine from the tremendous music composed by the great Hans Zimmer, you will surely never see a film quite like this one.",1
"No doubt the 148 minute time-run of ""Inception"" does not bore the viewer who keeps almost attached to the screen in order to follow each passage, trying not to lose any little piece which may be essential to understand the whole. Indeed, the picture is well structured, each passage well explained, each step told and retold, so that we are led through without getting lost in the apparent maze. The power of human mind appears as something infinite, but well controllable. In the end, everything gets a meaning, every piece matches with the others. But this was in my opinion also the limit of the movie, the pretence that human dreams, which are still considered as part of the most irrational side of man, may become so lucidly rational. We find Dom Cobb (Leonardo di Caprio) planning dreams, structuring them into more levels, a true architect of the mind, stealing ideas, introducing ideas into other people's mind, as if, in the end, the human mind were only reason and control. As if any mystery were cancelled and each one became a vulnerable puppet whose most inner secrets could be stolen from deep within the subconscious. I am probably an incurable supporter of the mystery of human beings, and cannot accept too much rationality, but this aspect of the movie in a way disappointed me. Thankfully the character of Mal, Cobb's wife, helps give the movie some sense of the uncontrollable within human life, something belonging to emotion and memories, which may be stronger, against any rational power. And, in the end, we are also no longer sure of the distinction between dream and reality, which urges the viewer to let some rationality aside and let the mystery find its own space. A movie which however proves very well built, having a good direction supporting it, and needless to say, the always talented performance by Di Caprio leaves the mark.",1

"Best movie ever. Best comic book movie ever. Best performance of an actor playing a crazed clown.... ever. Before I got cuffed upside the head with a bat-a-rang, this is my humble opinion. So if your a frothing fan boy who is going to spam me and b*tch about my opinion, (hey at least I know I am having an audience!) than just dl the script and make little script babies with it till your hearts content. First off the .. BAD! ha you thought I was going to start with the good. OK, what is up with Batman's Batman voice? I thought about it, and was like, maybe he has to smoke like 12 cigars and go clubbing in a nicotine infested dance floor while shouting out the lyrics to ACDC's thunderstruck in order to "" hide"" his Bruce Wayne voice, but every time Christian Bale used this tactic, I cringed in my seat. Umm, uncool. Secondly, Rachel Dawes (sp?) Her character is so out of place in this mythology, its painful. The movie is filled with nods to the comic's characters, I don't ever recall a Rachel from the books ( I could be wrong). Maggie G. is a fantastic actress, and I understand why her character is in place to motivate another character's actions but her character was the weakest link. I had as much emotional attachment to her as I did my 8th grade teacher. ( that was a slam btw) Thirdly, the tragedy. This one can not be helped, but Heath owns this movie. Every scene he is in, you can't take your eyes off the screen. The Joker here is Batman's ultimate nemesis, as he should be. It sucks realizing that his character can not be continued, and it sucks that an amazing actor left, but what a legacy. I doubt his performance will be topped. Now the good. ( and you thought I was a meanie :P) Heath obviously. The script is well paced, and though the movie is epic long ( 2 and a half hours me thinks) your so involved with the screen shenanigans, time just flies by. Nolan addressed his action faults from the first movie, and the action is filmed more clearly and with more heroic gusto. Now the main draw. This movie pushes an moral ambiguity through the film. I have to emphasize this especially through Harvey Dent. When you see this movie, it will bring up questions. Not stupid questions like when you watched Batman & Robin, but questions that burn a hole in the entire perception of duality in man. Wow. All and all, a great movie. Perfect? Far from it, but dangerously close. I can't wait, because of Nolan's achievement has changed the landscape of what to expect from a comic movie. It's still not the best comic book movie I've seen, but damn, what a ride. The days of crappy comic cop outs may be coming to end. ( see, I wasn't too malicious ;)",1
"The movie is a supply train of pain, and as it lays the tracks slowly out for you in order to trek down the stone walled path of an apathy driven environment, it almost instantaneously begins to conduct a subtle inference to hope, like an orchestra testing it's tools, you can hardly hear it at first, and it's chaos barely mimics sounds of redemption. Though once broken free from the cold tomb of realization that suffering is in fact guaranteed for some over others, you feel a certain appreciation for the experience you yourself will never have, a certain jealousy even. After all else has subsided, you'd like to believe after our own battles are over, they'll leave no laceration but only scars, but even scars can hurt still when winter comes, and when re-watching this movie, I still fill the cold pain in my thoughts from when I first viewed this selection. A great movie, one which endows to its viewers only a subtlety artificial sense of life in a prison.",1
"Known for its intense, brutal violence and ideological themes, Fight Club is considered by many one of the greatest films of the last two decades. With it's great narrative, quirky humour and compelling characters it is truly a film to enjoy. It is based on the novel by the same name by Chuck Palahniuk and is directed by David Fincher. Edward Norton portrays the film's protagonist. Norton's nameless character - which is only referred to as ""The Narrator"" - is stuck at a dead-end job living in his small apartment full of Ikea-junk. He's working at a car company where he spends his days filling out forms, making copies, drinking coffee and getting yelled at. After a long day at the office he comes home to his Ikea-infested two-room apartment, watches TV, eats his microwave-heated dinner and goes to bed. The narrator describes his life and his view of the world through dialogue where he uses sharp satire and direct social criticism. The narrator is a depressed social outcast that needs something _ or someone - to get his life going. He also suffers from insomnia, which doesn't make his life any more manageable. He eventually finds a rather odd ailment for his illness. He attends a support group for men who have suffered testicular cancer. This quickly becomes an addiction. He finds himself attending to several different groups a week and being unable to sleep without them. He does this undisturbed for some time until he meets a woman by the name of Marla Singer. Marla, played by Helena Bonham Carter, is a so-called ""tourist""; a person - who just likes the main character - attends self-help and therapy groups to make herself feel better. Knowing that there is another faker present he fails to open himself up emotionally. As a result of this the narrator fails to sleep once again.He eventually finds himself on a business flight sitting next to Tyler Durden. Portrayed by Brad Pitt, Tyler Durden is a genuine menace. Tyler shows strong disregard against society and the materialistic way of life of the western civilization. He believes that in order to truly be free you first have to lose everything. He is also an avid soap-maker. Through a various turn of events the Narrator and Tyler starts to organize a weekly fight club for men. More and more people hear about this and the club quickly expands. But as the fight club grows and becomes more organized the narrator starts to ask himself new questions: what exactly is happening around him and is there more to Tyler Durden than he is aware of?David Fincher has made a number of great films throughout his career (Se7ven, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Fight Club is no exception. He has done an excellent job transferring the book to the silver screen and has gained much admiration for it. Fincher's use of violence in the film is not something to shy away from. The brutal and graphic fight scenes were strongly criticized when it first came out in 1999. Not unlike Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange from 1971, it was condemned by many as a film that glorifies violence. In many ways these two movies are not very different. The use of violence and the human psyche is an on-going theme throughout both films. But the movie is not all about physical fighting. The film also focuses on emotional, mental and ideological fighting. It's about finding yourself and finding out what you really want to do with your life. There are a lot of factors that makes this film great; it is funny, it's brutal, and it's inspirational. It makes you question your own existence and what you are really supposed to do. Brad Pitt does an exceptionally good role as Tyler Durden, which is without a doubt one of his greatest performances to date. He is mesmerizing, and he really does a believable role as the charismatic and revolutionary sociopath. Along with Pitt is Edward Norton, who does an excellent job as the gloomy and often confused narrator. Elena Bonham Carter also does an avid and amusing role as the suicidal Marla Singer. The leading actors work really well together and it is plain to see that they have a lot of good chemistry throughout the film. Meat Loaf also plays a refreshing and fun part as the testicular cancer-victim and former bodybuilder Bob.Fight Club is a truly great film with a social message that many will sit and ponder over. The film combines violence, social criticism, masculinity, human relations and psychology in a mix that is sure to make an impression. It is without a doubt one of the most noteworthy films that has been made the last couple of decades. It is a film that many will enjoy, but some may occasionally cringe at some of its scenes. But no matter how you feel about this film you must not forget the first (and the s",1
"I always remember this film, especially the storyline when the main character of this film shows amazing performance and emotion.",1
"It is so great to see that originality in western film making isn't dead. I haven't been this enthralled by the first viewing of a film since Donnie Darko. The plot has complexities yes, but all are well explained and carefully handled so as no meaning or understanding is lost. The visual scope is stunning, and the pure concept is just so clever and so engaging. There are a few aspects that need to be accepted at face value, such as the ease at which Ellen Page's character applies her skill or sedatives altering a person's ability to transport themselves back into reality, but none of this is detrimental to the overall narrative and nor will it effect the viewers immersion. There is tension, emotion and the ongoing question of ""where will it go next?"" keeping you hooked to the end. This could well be a true modern day masterpiece.",1
"With the good score and knowing Nolans previous work I got into the movie with some expectation. But the whole thing for me was, wait, the fun (visual or intellectual) will begin now, but no, it didn't begin then, seemed that some more explanation was needed, so be patient, the fun will begin soon, that movie looks long.... now?, will it begin now?... and the movie ended.I was thinking to see it again, perhaps I was not my most brilliant intellectual day but fortunately I see others experienced something similar so it was not my fault I think.So, an average+ work but with that hype and the director's prestige it doesn't live to the expectations.",1
"Do people actually read these comments anyway?  Well, yeah, it seems that most people enjoyed Fight Club.  Oddly I wonder if the majority of the public actually understood the theme of the movie, or maybe the American public simply enjoyed the ""satire"" or happy go lucky violence.  I give Fincher credit for having massive picture effects and for creating this masterpiece of fascist and male chauvinistic propoganda.
Fight Club started out great.  The first 30 minutes were billiant.  Then where did they go wrong?  The movie was inconsistent between two parallels: State of Nature (State of War, a.k.a. anarchy, chaos, basically the opposite of society) and conformity.  It seemed like Fincher wanted to direct a movie about everything flawed in our society today, hitting subjects like individuality, equality, pragmatism (reality), etc.  but it was so...uniform and aimed at the general public that it fails to show WHY we are not our khakis.  And oh dear god, what screams establishment more than popular culture references?  So it constantly contradicts itself.  No...it doesn't, oh yeah it does, we aren't our khakis and pain is reality.  Blah blah blah.
Another thing, the whole theme of the movie is that our realities are so contorted by materialism that even pleasure isn't ""real"" anymore and that the only thing that's ""real"" and can save us is pain, i.e. getting punched in the face.  Yet this theme wasn't really executed in the movie.  It seemed more like 2 hours of sweaty men punching each other out!  I consider myself extremely liberal but I realize the needs of conformity in a society! Without uniformity to some degree, I assure you, 99.9% of our civilization would be lost.  Let's just throw away 5000 years of evolution and let natural selection kill everyone off except for people who're like Brad Pitt. Maybe I'm over analyzing, maybe I'm just too old-fashioned for all the new, hip anarchist-capitolists, but in my opinion, if people want exhilarating violence and male chauvinism (Fight Club failed to show the role of women in the cool new facist-anarchist empire we have a duty to create!)  they should go see the new James Bond movie or something, which was exactly what Fight Club is, minus the quasi-political subliminal messages:  ALL FLUFF!",1
"Batman ranks along the likes of Superman and Spider-Man as one of the most popular superheroes ever. In his brand new film, Batman has given us a satisfying sequel that's filled to the brim with action, drama and suspense.The Dark Knight places Batman (Christian Bale) in a struggle against the dreaded Joker (Heath Ledger) and his dastardly minions as the Joker attempts to dose Gotham City with large amounts of fear. In fact, The Joker is not so much interested in money as he is in bringing the city to it's knees! Bruce Wayne and Batman are played incredibly well by British actor Christian Bale who did a fine job in the previous movie. He makes the two identities of Wayne and Batman very different and gives a distinctive flavour to each one. Michael Cain does a great job as Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce's butler, who is against Bruce's desire for justice.What can I say? There are great special effects and the good thing is, there is hardly any CG - most of the fights and dangerous sequences are performed by humans making these fights extremely realistic. The film is - in most cases - extremely dark and this fits snugly into the tone of Batman. I don't mean 'I can't see!' dark, but dark as in night-time or dark streets with flickering lights etc.There are some bad things though; Batman's pretend 'dark voice' is comedic and there are times when it is impossible to take him seriously. Near the film's ending, Batman gives a speech that you can't understand at all because of his stupid voice. Looks like there's more than one Joker in town... Secondly, the plot can be quite confusing at first as it develops, but this isn't a major thing; you'll get it as it progresses even further.In conclusion, Batman has come to us in good form. Apart from some slightly boring moments and some other niggles, the film is generally amusing and incredibly entertaining.",1
"I wouldn't have written this review highlighting the weaknesses of this movie if it was not this highly rated. Personally I think 9+ is very much on higher side.The director has made his intentions clear in earlier movie, to make batman realistic. Batman is a fantasy and it is better kept that way, no amount of realism can make batman believable. Agreed, batman is not superman yet...Then the joker, who is joker, what is his origin? how come a deadly criminal like makes a sudden entry into crime world? Most important, what makes him so formidable? Why does it take only a batman to deal with joker? How does he manage to plant bombs at will? When did he develop his wide network and found so many assistants?The script writers solely relied on disturbing scenes and extremely violent nature of joker to show him off as a formidable villain. Joker's character is not as well developed as many viewers seem to think, because most of this is narrated by joker himself or Caine in explicit words.It would have better if Joker strength was attributed to his ability to convince and manipulate people. But this is shown in only one occasion.Then some thing that seemed out of place was Batman turning American. For the first time batman movie indulged in Russia and china bashing though it is shown in a very subtle way. Batman turns James Bond, respects only American law and throws away international laws. Batman is better confined to Gotham city and away from these politics.Lastly this is definitely not a movie for family unlike batman series. With a background that implies violence its more disturbing than other gory movies.",1
"** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, it's quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.It is a given that Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film's opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworld's combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn't have been. Uneven scripting there.But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The ultimate reason why ""The Dark Knight"" falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK, here is where people start saying: ""But it's a movie! It doesn't have to be possible."" I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn't have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as ""The Dark Knight"" wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a mere ""superhero movie,"" or ""action movie."" Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they aren't smart enough to be effective as help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c'mon, he doesn't exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have supernatural powers, so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura.(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he's almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit stiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in ""The Prestige"" was more emotional, effective, and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in ""Thank You For Smoking."" Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that's not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but I'll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such ""The Dark Knight"" succeeded in escaping the ""superhero movie"" label. But it's not a masterpiece.Plain and simply, it has too many holes.",1
"What an amazing piece of cinema.Inception has a uniqueness too it that hasn't been seen before in a long time. Director Christopher Nolan immerses you in a world beyond imagination, and makes you feel like you are part of the experience.The amazing camera work and visual effects help to tell a unique story of determination, will power, and love.Inception is a thriller that takes you on a ride the whole way, leaving you wanting more all the way till the very end!Leonardo DiCaprio, Marion Coutillard, and Tom Hardy all do a phenomenal job in bringing their characters to life in a believable way.This will go down as one of my favorite movies of all time.",1
"The skill of the director is perfect, the degree of completion is high. This is no longer an ordinary superhero movie.",1
"Fight Club is a movie capable of being viewed on multiple levels, one of these is it's post-modernity vs. modernity stance. Thinking that the miracles of technology and working for the greater good so in 50 years we'll have robots to walk our dogs and flying jetson cars has already been proven to have failed. we're not solving our problems through science. we're not as individuals happy for the work we do. post modernity is what's taken it's place. stick with more natural things, believing in instinct for once instead of what society has programmed into your brain as to what's right and what's wrong. men can be men. one line in fight club is ' we're a generation of men raised by women. i'm starting to wonder if another woman is really the answer we're looking for.' in a time when everybody's hands seem tied in one way or another, it's exciting to see a movie where the characters decide no more. they take it to the nialistic and anarchist extremes, and it's very fun to watch. more than once of course, because everytime you watch it you see something new. and the ending in my opinion was the biggest surprise of it's year, not Sixth Sense. watch it, own it, love it. it's Fight Club. 'nuff said.",1
"I personally don't like movies that take place in prisons. That is because I cant stand watching people being imprisoned or tortured in some way.And that usually happens in those movies. But this one is different. It really has an interesting story. And a good plot.ry That's why I generally like it. And the actors performed more than fine. The only reason for which I can not give it top marks is - it does happen in prison. I also had to admit that the is a yucky part. And I don't think that a person would be actually able to do it. To swim through 16m of sh*t to freedom. Freedom is valuable, but people cant do it, like they cant spread wings and fly for freedom :)",1
"One of the best movies that I saw. Great actors, story, soundtrack, dialogues, and ... it's all perfect. The storyline and events of the film do not allow you to feel repetitive or bored for a moment.",1
As per my exprience view this Awesome talent use in the jack ryan very nice !!!,1
"It is a good movie about fighting. It doesn't matter who you are , where you live, what you have it's only matter what you truly want in your life. We all have fears, many fears and as for fighting them we need to have something motivating us. Sometimes it's real but sometimes... Movie is motivating to live, to fight and to win. What if where you now is not your place. What if somewhere in the world big things are waiting for you. What if you will lose your chance to show yourself and just be who you are. What if you will waste your life and it will to late to change anything. It's always time to begin today. It's your day, THAT day",1
"After all this time, this is still one of my favorite movies! This film has everything! it goes around romance, fiction, friendship and family values and beyond. I never get sick of it. Christopher Nolan never seizes to surprise me. His cast is always beautifully chosen and the special effects are amazing. my only advice is for you to pay attention to the movie or else you'll get lost in the middle.",1
"Cobb (DiCaprio) is an Extractor, who steals industrial secrets by getting into a person's dreams and getting what he needs. But, Mr. Saito (Watanabe) hires Cobb and wants him to implant (called inception) a notion in Fischer's (Murphy) dream to have him break up his late father's company or the whole world will be held hostage to the monopoly. Watching Inception is like looking at a Picasso painting. You are not sure what you are seeing. You see some things you like, some you don't, and much (if not all) you don't understand. But, you keep looking to see if it makes sense to you. I'll leave it there. There is a lot of gobbley-gook explanations psychiatrists would salivate at. There are dreams, dreams within dreams, and dreams within deeper levels of dreams within dreams. See? Once you get by the gobbley-gook explanations you sit and watch the movie like you watched an old Mission Impossible TV show back in the day. You are mesmerized. You watch wires being strung, explosive charges placed, monitors placed, needles injected, lies and other rationalizations being told. See, just like an old Mission Impossible TV show, except there are also tons of gunfire and car chases which MI didn't have much of. But, the CGI and other special effects are simply fantastic and yes, these things are perhaps things you might see in dreams because _ as you well know- many things are possible in dreams where the illogical become logical. Hey, this is a dream. Anything is possible. Things that don't make sense in the real world become real within a dream and they make sense. Perfectly logical. See?The actors become intense and so do you and you are fully engaged now once the dreams within dreams start. All is good except for one thing: the movie is too long and you are looking for the end game. If they had cut 40-minutes out, this would have been more enjoyable. But, too much shooting etc takes its toll, and, this hurts any Best Picture Oscar nomination in my view. There is no denying that Leonardo DiCaprio raises the performances of everyone around him and this is blatantly obvious and that's a good thing. One day Hollywood will see that he and Matt Damon (not in this movie) are Oscar worthy actors. One day. After seeing this, I know 3-things: (1) If you saw this in a movie theater, you may be encouraged to take out the DVD and watch it again fast-forwarding thru the too many shootings, car chases and explosions. And, (2) When you next see a Picasso painting you may be reminded of this movie. And, (3) You are going to try to control what you do in your dreams. Good luck with that. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, just JCs and GDIs. No F-bombs.",1
"Inception is the most mind boggling movie i have ever watched. Christopher Nolan spent 10 years writing his screenplay for the movie. The movie will keep you in amazement and finally in the end you will end up with a lot of confusion. The suspense and thrill that the director has created is mesmerising. The story is about a man named ""Cobb""(Leonardo D' Caprio) who infiltrates other peoples minds and steal their ideas. Now a rbillionaire makes him an offer that he can't refuse to get inside the mind of his rival in business and stop him from starting a new business empire which could ruin Saito's business (The Billionaire). Cobb hires a young architect and asks her to create a maze for the infiltration. After he succeds in his mission he eventually find a solution for his problem of sleeping and deciding between real world and the dream world where his wife becomes lost. Nolan also leaves you with a suspense in the end which you can discover after you watch the movie. The movie really spins of your mind and you start contemplating about the consious and the subconsious mind.",1
This is really an outstanding sci-fiction movie and leo's acting was great . Christopher Nolan did great.,1
"Well, it's here, the movie of the summer and likely the movie of the year, too. Everyone had high hopes for The Dark Knight, and they were raised as new trailers were released and even moreso after Heath Ledger, our new Clown Prince of Crime, died, and the movie itself surpassed all of them.For one, let's talk about the movie as a whole. It's clear that Nolan and the main actors have all read their comics - Ledger apparently loves The Killing Joke - and done their homework, as on the prequel to this one, Batman Begins. What I love most about this is that it doesn't stray from the comics just to make the movie more watchable on screen, but rather to make the series fresh and innovative. Nolan takes the fabric of the Batman story and contorts it into something that it very well could have been if started in 2008 instead of 1940. Never does it feel forced or cheap, just...an alternative. A well made alternative at that.This is definitely a success as a comic book movie, but we also have an added dose of hyperactive, metal-spiked flaming tank ownage via Die Hard 3, vamping the levels of ass-kicking up about ten notches. Seriously, this just rules all the way through, with a polished sheen and a ton of edgy, super-memorable scenes that will keep you coming back again and again. There's a lot going on here, about three different subplots, and I definitely didn't catch everything on one viewing. But the speed is just another reason this is good, rather than a detractor, as in the first film. Everything is done a step up better than on the film's prequel, and that is how any sequel should be, but usually isn't.The acting is the other high point. I felt that the acting in Batman Begins was sometimes inadequate, but that has been fixed here. This is more relaxed, calculated and well performed, with sterling performances by Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart (honorable mentions for his excellent Two Face, nobody could have done it better!) and especially Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is indeed of the Killing Joke school, except he's even more dark and devious than he was in that novel. Every moment he's on screen he captivates, being the perfect counterbalance to Batman's rigid, often frightening justice stance. The ""disappearing pencil"" trick, the ""Why so serious?"" scene, and his final moments, laughing in the wind of the night...all masterful, completely superlative. Every inch of the praise upon him is worthy. Believe it.So basically this rules, see it instead of whatever other movie you were planning on seeing in 2008. The bar has been set high for a third installment to this series, and even if there isn't one, well, it's always better to go out on a high note. And that's what The Dark Knight is; a high note. My highest recommendation.",1
This movie was the best I love it and my Favorite character was The Joker because Heath Ledger Did a perfect job as The Joker and The best part I love about the joker in this movie is when him and Batman were interrogates,1
"This movie was anticipated by me and my friends for months and we expected an amazing movie from watching the trailers. We did not however see an amazing movie, we saw one of the best movies ever made period.Heath Ledger is truly frightening throughout the movie, every detail in his acting, even his eye movements convinced the viewer that he was completely submersed in the role. It is unfortunate he could not see the unbelievable success of his impeccable work.The rest of the movie, plot, storyline, STUNTS, just absolutely amazing. This is by far the must see movie of the year and i am getting a Blu-Ray player just so i can get this movie on Blu-Ray when it comes out. It is one of the best movies ever made and simply clicking on the top 250 movies in the top left hand corner of the screen will prove that point.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that people either love or ? well, hate is probably the wrong word.It's an OK film, but lacks in so many areas, most of all script and ideas. Yet again, we are subjected to an innocent man being sent to prison, governed by a sadistic guard and corrupt governor. Yet again, we see him get a glimmer of hope of release, and yet again we see hope destroyed.It's not exactly original.But, it is well filmed, and superbly acted. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played the lead roles to perfection. The surrounding parts were played as equally well, and none let the film down. Pity about the script.Don't get me started about the poster on the wall. All the searches, and no-one took it down? Oh, come on.Watch the film ? yes, even enjoy it. But please don't think it's one of the best.",1
"In 2005, Christopher Nolan reinvented the superhero movie with Batman Begins - not a bad thing, given Spider-Man 2 had practically achieved the same goal the year before. Now, history repeats itself with The Dark Knight: technically, it's the sixth Batman movie (or seventh, if you count the 1966 TV show tie-in), but it leaves you feeling like the previous entries never existed. Yes, even Begins.The first chapter of Nolan's Bats reboot ended suggesting the sequel would revolve around a certain clownish criminal who sees everything as a big joke and signs his horrific deeds with an instantly recognizable ""calling card"", and indeed it does: five minutes into The Dark Knight, and after a bank job that looks more like Michael Mann than Chris Nolan, we are face to face with the Joker (the late, astounding Heath Ledger), who greets us with one of his trademark outbursts of twisted logic: ""I believe that what doesn't kill you simply makes you... stranger."". Unlike any other foe Batman (Christian Bale) has ever faced, he isn't in it for the money, like Gotham's current mob boss Salvatore Maroni (Eric Roberts), or anything else: he just wants to spread chaos and anarchy, killing good guys and bad guys in equal measure. In order to stop him, Batman and Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) seek the help of the city's new District Attorney, the charismatic Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who also happens to be dating Bruce Wayne's former squeeze Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who does a more convincing job than Katie Holmes).Of course, things aren't easy. As Dent points out: ""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". That's a phrase whose full meaning is revealed to terrible effect during the film, as the Joker's insane antics push Batman into the one direction he swore to stay away from: killing. The Dark Knight is as much a morality tale as it is a summer blockbuster: the title indicates a bleaker atmosphere will permeate the picture, and that's exactly what happens - even Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who provided the comic relief in the first movie, have a different function now that Gotham's fate looks worse than ever, courtesy of a make-up-wearing, constantly laughing maniac.In many ways, the movie belongs to the Joker, just like Tim Burton's version did in 1989. Ledger's take on the character, however, is completely different from Jack Nicholson's dandy interpretation, which became a successful blueprint for subsequent celluloid villains lifted from comics. The 21st century Joker is a pure psychopath, not a buffoon. His pranks aren't amusing, they're terrifying and very often lethal. He's a masochistic, fearless nihilist, played with tons of courage by a Ledger at the top of his game, a fact that makes his premature death (and the dedication in the end credits) even more unbearable than it already is. Talks of a posthumous Oscar are fully justified, since this is the culmination of his career, although the Academy has the annoying tendency to ignore acting in films like this (see Alec Guinness in Star Wars or Ian McKellen in The Fellowship of the Ring). Still, some sort of honorary recognition would be more than appropriate, since he has taken the essence of a comic-book character and made him so much more, a symbol of true evil that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the equally iconic - and scary - Alex DeLarge, Hannibal Lecter and Keyser Soze.But then again, is this film really all about the villain? No. At its core, The Dark Knight remains a movie about Batman himself, a man burdened with guilt and destined to loneliness. In fact, while the previous entry in the franchise focused largely on how he became the crime-fighter he is today, not one minute of this installment deals with the Joker's origins: when we first meet him he's already the most feared criminal in Gotham, and the few references to his past that come out of his mouth reflect his celebrated line from Alan Moore's graphic novel The Killing Joke: ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes the other. If I'm going to have a past, i prefer it to be multiple choice!"".The Killing Joke also inspires the film's biggest theme: the similarities between Batman and his nemesis. This isn't exactly a new element in Nolan's filmography: from Leonard and Teddy in Memento to Angier and Borden in The Prestige, he's always been concerned with the complex relationship that shapes up between two enemies. This time he offers his most radical take on the subject, with an interrogation scene that goes hand in hand with the coffee shop sequence in Michael Mann's Heat (another important influence, by the director's admission): ""I don't wanna kill you!"" the Joker tells the Caped Crusader. ""What would I do without you? [...] You... complete me. [...] To them, you're just a freak. Like me!"". The comics have consistently suggested the Dark Knight and his most famous nemesis are really just two sides of the same coin. Nolan brings that theory to the screen with a visual and narrative boldness previously unheard of in the superhero genre, with a possibly even more disturbing variation on the theme coming in the shape of Aaron Eckhart's unsettling performance (the less said about it, the better: it has to be seen to be believed).Moral ambiguity, madness, bravery, betrayal, vengeance, responsibility, all in one movie. Shakespeare? No, just a damn smart, daring genre picture that goes beyond its paper roots and transforms into a cinematic tragedy of rare power and beauty. It will take something special to top this epic achievement.",1
"Best Christopher Nolan's movie. One of my favourite movies ever. Everything is perfect, story telling, acting, music, it deserve 8.8. Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan is iconic duo.",1
What makes this movie great is how the characters interact from start to end and building up this club and when people break the rules you receive consequences and how characters change at the start and at the end,1
"This movie just ruined my imagination as it is so complex and thrillingly amazing it will get on one's mind and word as an adhesive making you stick to the edge of your seats till you give up in front of its elegance maturity. A wonder full screenplay and a cinematic extravaganza. a movie to be preserved. Leonardo Di Carpio is amazing. It is a clear ace. Watch it for his story and the wonderful concept of an idea being a crime scene. this is heck of a good thriller... good.. this is the best of the best. Kudos to Christopher Nolan for gifting us with the following, memento, insomnia, batman begins, the prestige, the dark knight and his best inception.",1
"Sigh. They almost got it right, and with the right franchise too (Batman as the HUNTED hero had the most potential as allegory for the male human condition). Unfortunately at some point the fact that this is a reboot (of a reboot)^3--in just the movie series alone--is a problem. It implies a serious weakness in the CONCEPT ITSELF.As I was writing this review I asked myself just when did I drop out of this movie? -11 minutes in. By then there were already enough annoyances to have induced my disengagement. Here are some of them: 1) The reboots(!); 2) the bank job prologue (opening scene) which adapts the basic story of 44Minutes:The_North_Hollywood_Shoot-Out(2003 made-for-TV docudrama); 3) wasting William Fichtner in a nothing mobster role all over in a second; 4) too many red herrings with the ridiculous faux ""Batdudes""; 5) Batman's audio-""soured"" voice; 6) Lt.Gordon(Oldman)'s similarly but accidentally audio-""soured"" voice in the vault scene as he says ""we'd have to hit all the banks simultaneously, SWAT teams..."" (we DID notice,sorry) --and all this within the first 11mins!!Then there was the manipulative attempt at confusing the ignorant in the audience with the ruse about Commissioner Gordon. Anyone who knows this term will not accept LIEUTENANT Gordon's untimely death, but it's enough to turn us against the screenwriter. This is called ""ratcheting"" the plot, aka ""yanking the audience's chain"". And there's a lot more where that came from in this movie--that's its main problem.One admittedly unavoidable problem was caused be the basic pull--antagonism--in a graphic novel adaptation into live action: superhero comics naturally venture into the fantastic, and it's hard to show the impossible for real. If you're trying to insert fantasy into a police procedural, you cannot get gross or outlandish in the way you represent this.For instance, during the transportation scene with Harvey Dent(Eckhart), although it already rankles that the truck-driver's offsider does nothing to prevent the hijacking during the VERY OBVIOUS criminal misdirection with the burning firetruck, the over-the-top nature of the graffiti'd word ""SLAUGHTER"" on the side of the attacking rig just makes you lose patience with their abandonment of their previous police procedural tone.Ebert likes this installment best. I know why; it's because this sequel tries so hard to be both realistic and allegorical towards society's ills, but it's at junctures like the above hijack scene that if they get it just a little bit on the ""wrong"" side for people like me, they take us out of their picture.And I have bad news for the filmmakers: sooner or later we will all be thinking like this. It's a function of their having raised the bar, but just not far enough, so it undermines its own standard.For people like them, CGI is a trap like catnip. It's all in the tone that you strike; and if you decided that it's OK to depict Two-Face's face all in CGI, revealing teeth underneath the skinless CG-muscle and tendons on that side, then you deserve the flak you're going to cop for it. Here it is: what a SHODDY, mistaken choice that was! It makes your almost-great movie into an embarrassing piece of ""shlock""--YES, there is a word for it.Shlock. Or shtick. Where is Mel Brooks when you really need him?More examples of wrong tonal balance:7) the dinner debate scene about Batman's future role in a democracy is theoretically very admirable, but misfires because it's misplaced at the table amidst all the verbal fencing between two couples(!)--its gravitas is lost in the shuffle;8) Bruce Wayne's awful speech pillorying Harvey Dent undermines our faith in him too, which he tries to undo for Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal's annoying replacement for Katie Holmes again smacks of ""rebootism""). His venom was unnecessary, what was his point?;9) (just a little bit) more screen-time should have been paid to the emergent concern of Harvey/Gordon's prisoners in the traffic snarl, so we could emotionally join in on the ferry for the scene's significance for humane compassion. The battle of wills with The Joker about this was significant, but the audience doesn't get to chew over the so-called Prisoner's Dilemma (from game theory);10) Two-Face was too rabid in his scenes. He/Harvey used to be well-adjusted, so the (ratcheted) petrol burn and the accidental loss of his fiancée simply didn't justify why he became so violent. Without showing his back-story, it's irresponsible to either kill him or turn him so deeply and irrevocably psychotic, all in one picture. Where's the deep significance of ""what he lost""?; 11) Dent's hospital-room yelling is implausible: he shouldn't have enough strength to roar at Gordon, let alone have the option of rejecting skin grafts. No ER patient would be given that option. Since this is completely implausible, why ruin our disbelief?;12-A) Dent's skeletal musculature CG vision is also wrong within the Batman mythos. But burn victims never have clean muscle afterwards anyway, so why depict a falsity when you could have just applied practical prosthetics? -for obvious directorial (self-)indulgence given access to cheap CGI;12-B) there was no plotwise reason for the deep burn either, since Batman was rescuing Dent from the flames. Why was Two-Face burned? -Again, purely directorial self-indulgence with CG (I would've loved to hear the screaming-match in the Exec Prod's office about this);13) the darkened interrogation cell for The Joker was also audience-manipulative directorial self-indulgence. The room, if you recall, was darkened excessively during Gordon's interrogation, just so the Batman reveal could shock the audience. Completely implausible; wouldn't have worked in real life because reality can't control ""the fourth wall"" (the audience's POV). Overripe and ridiculous.B-TDK(2008) does contain several great points, but I'm not wasting word-count on them. Suffice to say that ""Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin (CLEARLY) ran away""...",1
"Well I just saw the movie for the second time, some weeks after seeing it the first time during the opening weekend. I have to say that knowing what was coming made me pay attention to the actual content even more than the first time, and you know what? It held up, in my opinion. Surprisingly so. So all of my comments below apply, except for the one about the bit I didn't like. Still didn't like it, but appreciated it more in the overall context of the plot and character development. So what I said the first time was:This is a movie that is so complete, it actually is better than the hype (and that was a hell of a lot of hype, wasn't it?). It works on SO many levels; it actually IS a darkly philosophical, character-driven action movie. That sounds like a contradiction, but as my companion put it so nicely afterwards, the action sequences actually pushed along the plot and the character development.Philosophical? An action movie? Well, yes. Just type in the words ""good evil philosophical"" and ""Dark Knight"" into Google and you get the likes of this link, amongst 57,300 weblinks: ""The Dark Knight - A Philosophical Review"" www.gregboyd.org/blog/the-dark-knight-a-philosophical-review/ As I said, the movie works on so many levels.So why don't I give it a 10 then? Because I didn't want what happened to Rachel Dawe to have happened. Yes, it was true to the spirit of the story. Yes, it was consistent with the story, and in fact was necessary for the further development of the Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne characters, BUT I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT. So there.Amendment: The second time around I was able to be prepared for the moment and appreciate its place in the film. And there was SO much more to see and to catch the second time that made the movie that much better for me (and for my friend who normally doesn't like ""action"" movies - she liked it better the second time, too).That said, this is now THE Batman movie, in fact THE action movie. It has set a new standard for the quality and the depth. I for one cannot see a third in this current sequence coming out anytime soon, because this one has done such a good job.And as I said before, it was _better_ the second time. There aren't many movies about which you can say that, except those on the ""Best of"" lists. And this certainly belongs on that list.Oh, and Heath definitely deserves at the very least a posthumous nomination for Best Supporting Actor.",1
"I thought this movie was great. I don't normally like dark and gritty, but this movie was done well. I like Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker. It's not the best though. I would like to see a well rounded Joker in the future. I like how this movie shows how he deals with being a hero/vigilante. That it isn't easy and that you will have to make sacrifices. The cast was well picked and so was the crew. Christopher Nolan has done great things with this trilogy and I would like to say ""Good job Christopher Nolan, for doing what no one has done with Batman."" I find it interesting that this series is taking away any unrealistic things about Batman and his villains. That instead of Joker being a toxic accident, he is just a thug with make-up. Instead of Ra's being immortal, he is immortal through people taking on his title. I like the unrealisticness from the comics better but Nolan did a great job making these characters realistic.",1
"The Dark Knight, in my humble opinion, is nothing less than a masterpiece. But there are different colors for different tastes, but don't worry, I won't say ""you are a fool if you didn't like it"".Why is this movie a masterpiece? Well, here we go.... Let's have something clear first: this movie is not about Batman, is about Gotham city. I live in a country intoxicated with corruption, and after all these years, well, let's say you can expect anything... But, recently, there's a new possible president, and, as the way everybody is seeing it, he will be our Harvey Dent... Let's just hope he won't have an accident involving gasoline and fire!...Anyway... I think a movie is a masterpiece when it can portrait this things in a very actual and natural way (like Costa-Gavra's Z), how great cities are made of! when you know the basics in sociology, philosophy and psychology, you realize there's no good or evil, everything is relative. There is only one thing we can achieve: the greater good. But this is not something you can achieve in one day, is something you have to go a very long way just to have a glimpse. There are a lot of great movies and books that had portray this in a very faithful way. Like Goehte's Faust.Between the lights and shades, you can see a great city sunk in corruption, drugs and misery, hoping for someone who can actually fight for their rights, making real justice. And as you saw in the movie, Harvey Dent, The white knight, is this person. Too bad he had the accident, but Hey! there's always irony in our universe.You have to see and explore the dark so you can comprehend the light, and I think Nolan has always known this, and that is why I love all of his films.At the end of the movie, neither Dent nor Batman can prove by their own means to be the hero Gotham wants, but needs. And they make this sacrifice for, as you know, the greater good... Glorious... I left the cinema with tears in my eyes... remembering a lot of sacrifices in real life, made by real heroes, that passed unnoticed, just for (here we go again) the greater good! I expected more from the joker and less from the movie... at the end, I was amazed! The dark knight has the perfect measure, so every character is great and amazing! Don't get me wrong, I loved the joker, but with all the viral marketing WB released before the movie, I thought they would give more relevance to the joker than Batman or the movie itself, but gladly, they didn't.What I loved the most? Above all, the script. It's great. The acting, the cinematography, the music, the direction... Everything! I'm not saying this movie is perfect, but how can we, humans after all, describe perfection? Art is subjective, so for me, The Dark Knight is Perfect!",1
"Christopher nolan so good a director, we can easily see the difference of it, camera angles and shots very nice, deserves score",1
"This was one of the best movies I've seen all year, but it fell short of being as good as it could have been.  I thought the acting by the two important cast members was excellent; I was especially impressed with the development of Ed Norton's character.  The movie didn't try and be too deep and wasn't afraid to use humor to keep the story interesting.  The characters were somewhat comical, but lent to the story well without being one dimensional and silly.There were some flaws with this film though.  The movie tends to drag at times when they just reinforce an aspect of the movie to make sure you get it.  ""Tyler's anti-mainstream we get it, move on please""; "" ""okay. they fight move on please"".  There are about three long dead spaces like this in the movie.  Unfortunately, from the big twist in the story to the end is the worst of these dead times. The movie should have ended right after the twist.  The big finale seems irrelevant to the story and forced into the plot.  The end seemed like an add-on that was not well explained or had any importance.  I can imagine the writers sitting around saying we need to end big, but I don't know how.  Just blow something up.The reason I bring out the negative points is because the Hollywood laziness that plagues the film industry reduced this movie from being a classic to being a really good movie.  They had a good story, great acting, and a moment in history for which the message was relevant, but they cut the rope short filled the movie with some dead space and threw together an ending.In summary it was one of the best movies of the year, but fell short of what it could have been.",1
"I have nothing to complain about with this movie. It's absolutely incredible, from start to finish. The Joker is a force of nature, and he is truly terrifying to behold. He's funny and charismatic, and at the same time, horrible. Batman seems all grown up in this one, as compared to Batman Begins; he's got all the awesome gadgets, cool vehicles, everything. They beefed him up a little bit, and the scenes where he is fighting are filmed such that this time, we actually get a good view of his combat prowess. There is a lot of discourse on Batman's role in Gotham, as well as the Joker's, and how the two are intertwined, and Batman has to make a lot of difficult moral choices, one of which ends up costing him -- and Gotham City -- dearly. There were some unexpected twists, as well, and all of it is satisfying. The cinematography and direction are wonderful; some of the shots of Gotham and Gotham's skyline are absolutely breathtaking. The length of this film is not an issue, as every second holds your attention, especially when the Joker is on screen. Heath Ledger delivered a truly legendary performance, bringing the Joker to life in every last little detail, and it's a shame we won't see this character again, though maybe that's a good thing -- I think it would be nearly impossible to match this performance, let alone surpass it. This is one of those rare sequels that is well and truly better than the first, a movie about the nature of heroes, both super and regular, and the way society needs them. It's about chaos and order, and fear. Nobody in Gotham is safe from the Joker, right up until the last minutes of the movie, and I mean nobody. Ledger elevated the character to a whole new level, beyond the clown with homicidal tendencies we're all already familiar with, turning him into something just barely human -- or perhaps all too human, as he suggests at one point. When the fabric of society breaks down, and anarchy is all that's left, people are basically animals; the difference between us and the Joker is that we wait for the breakdown -- he *is* the breakdown. This movie is an instant classic, I can't say enough good things about it.",1
"Although i say this with considerable bias as i have loved Batman lore since i was 3-4 years old, watching dark knight was one of the best movie experiences i have ever had. I consider myself to be a batman expert of sorts, watched every animated/real movie and every animated/real series. In addition i have also read quite a few comics. Not do demote Heath Ledgers spectacular performance, but the Joker is not what i would expect, he sort of ruins the dichotomy between Joker and Batman. Although Mark Hammil is still my favourite joker, I think Heath's is superior to Nicholson's. However Nicholson's joker was a much more pure and wholehearted Joker, and perhaps Heath would have not performed such a joker as well as Jack. Back to the movie, there seems to be a very strong Chaotic theme, and backed with great effects. The jokers who is well portrayed as a mad dog keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, I kept wondering what will go wrong next. Although Nolan's direction gives me a headache sometimes, especially since you have to decipher how the combat is going from the hints the camera gives you(too much random shakiness), I have to say that it's improved from since Batman Begins. I recommend this to everyone!",1
"When the amazing Chris Nolan took the helm of the Batman Begins - my instincts said that he would do something different. And he didn't disappoint. In the second installment from Nolan - you can sense genuine agony and doubt in the caped crusader. He realizes that how difficult his job is and that he is not infallible, especially when he comes face to face with an equally powerful (not in strength - but in conviction) enemy who lies squarely on the other end of the morality scale.Anyone familiar with the history of Batman comics - will know that amongst all the Batman villains - it is the Joker who brings out the best (and the worst) in Batman. To draw another cinematic reference - as Samuel Jackson's Elijah mentions in the movie ""Unbreakable"" - each superhero has his arch enemy amongst other enemies. This arch enemy is typically very similar to the superhero - just believes in causes which are diametrically opposite to the beliefs of the superhero. (Another example - Superman & Lex Luthor) So what typically happens in the conflict between the Superhero and his arch enemy is that against the backdrop of the larger fight between ""Good"" and ""Evil"" - the mental and physical (in that order) conflict between the hero and the villain takes centerstage. It becomes personal. Both see their reflections in the other...to the point that the existence of one, hangs on the existence of the other. Chris Nolan handles this complex relationship between Batman and his arch enemy with considerable insight and for the lack of a better term - tenderness. But that's not what makes the movie work so well. It is Heath Ledger's interpretation of the Joker - and what the character stands for - that shocks, provokes and gives an entire new meaning to the on-screen villain.The Joker is essentially an anarchist. He has no specific objective (""I am like a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do, if I caught one""). He just feels that with the coming of Batman, Harvey Dent and Jim Gordon - the balance between good and evil is getting lopsided. He feels there needs to be ""a new class of criminal"" - to create destruction for the sake of it. He is anti-thesis, anti-gravity and anti-establishment - all rolled into one. He represents the other side...and actually believes his existence is necessary for the existence of the regular or ""good"" side. He dislikes the scheming plotting planning nature of ""socially acceptable"" humans - as he sees no ""grand"" plan in how the world unfolds around him. He believes that the Sun is there to burn...not warm. He believes that evil should exist in the world without purpose - and hates so called criminals with monetary objectives. He does doesn't mind if people call him a freak - in fact he revels in that. He believes that there is a Joker hidden inside every human being...and he wants to bring that side out. Most of all...he is crystal clear about his purpose and role in the world. (How many of us can say that? ;)) Don't mistake the joker as unhinged. He probably is the only one not.And all this is magnified when projected from behind the ultimate mask of duality. The face of a clown. Good when there is evil. Laughter where there is pain. Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker is nothing short of terrifying. To me he makes Alien Vs. Predator look like a kindergarten costume party. And this is partly because he makes it look so frighteningly real. But what he also does is that he defies our instinct for rationalizing everything we see. When we see a real life villain like Osama Bin Laden fly planes into our buildings - we rationalize, cook up conspiracies, wage wars. Because there is a ""reason"" why someone would do this...right? The Joker defies reason. And that is the most unsettling bit about Heath Ledger's character.Batman had given himself the purpose of clean Gotham's streets. But if you dig deeper into the character - he still feels that he is ""forcefully"" rationalizing his existence - by juxtaposing it with these cheap criminals. ""I have to do good things - because I have to give the citizens of Gotham a better life."" With the joker - he realizes (as you see in the end of the movie) that he doesn't have to ""appear"" good and that appearances are just that. Appearances. He realizes when he comes face to face with his arch enemy and the broken hero ""Two Face/Harvey Dent"" - that he exists because a character like the Joker exists. He attains the same amount of clarity of purpose and role - that the Joker has. And that's what makes Batman complete. It is the Joker who makes Batman believe in himself and his purpose.One of my favorite Joker dialogues is when he hisses, ""You make me complete."" I now realize that he was speaking for both of them.I hope all of you have watched this movie - if not, I hope you watch it. And not just for the special effects.",1
"When I went to theater expecting something similar to Batman Begins, an average good all around action movie. What I got from the Dark Knight is a perfect beautiful masterpiece with very little flaws if any. Heath ledger is a master at his role. He is the best villain in any movie I have ever seen. It is a shame he died because he is a very good actor. Christain Bale had another good performance and the rest of the cast had great showings. The plot was great and I have to say that Heath ledger is a great great joker and no one can match him. Heath ledger is another new edition to the cast and is a good prosecutor. Batman learns more about himself fighting joker then he ever imagined.",1
"well you all knew this was coming so here goes my review of The Dark Knight.this movie is phenomenal!! you all probably figured that is what i would say but let me explain my reasoning besides the fact that its Batman. well to start it off, Batman Begins is one of my favorite movies and The Dark Knight expands on everything that was great about the first one. the acting is one of the main draws here, with Christopher Nolan expertly showcasing the scenes of dialogue between characters. Nolan manages to highlight just plain old talking into something amazing. the entire cast is superb (with Maggie Gyllenhall replacing the atrocious Katie Holmes) but the best addition is, of course, Heath Ledger. now during the course of this epic 2 and a half hour masterpiece Ledger's Joker is one of the greatest performances you will ever lay your eyes on. the things he does with this character are just mind-boggling. it blows Jack Nicholson's portrayal out of the water. he is the absolute best part of this movie. but it is just heart breaking to know once the lights come up in the theater that this is the last time you will ever see a new complete performance from the great Heath Ledger. his performance most certainly deserves a posthumous Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.another great addition is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two Face. yes in this movie he does show up as Two Face and he is awesome! also the twists and turns in this movie will just shock you. its an expertly crafted script and cast and is so beautifully directed. and even as long as it is, the movie just zips by. it is the shortest feeling 2 and half hours i have ever experienced at the movies and i wanted more. but of course it is set up for a 3rd that it should be required to make. so as it stands The Dark Knight is my pick for the best film for 2008 and i award it the score of 10 out of 10.",1
"I'd never heard of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a ""sleeper,"" on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Heat."" I didn't see ""Forrest Gump"" until around 2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back through), I suppose ""Shawshank"" will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making ""Hey, it's not all that!"" (That is, it's not all that good, it's lousy, it's overrated, etc.)Whatever, it's a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for ""The Big Lebowski,"" which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now it's a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like ""Rocky Horror"" once was. I saw ""Rocky Horror"" in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable.",1
"Just love it. Good film always encourage to maker to make more good film.
Best luck.",1
"One of the best movies i have seen till date,I did not see it till 2015 and always wondered whats's so special about this movie that it's sitting there at the top of the IMDb list and hasn't'been dethroned since ages? I finally decided it was about time i find it out and holy moly,it totally deserves that spot up top and i don't think there will ever be a movie which comes to a s close as this.",1
"One of the most amazing movies out there. Everyone can relate or feel some type of sympathy towards the different characters in the movie. The plot is just so well written and the directing is incredible. The acting of every single character in the movie is so believable that there are times throughout the movie where you feel like you are there, physically with them.",1
"Trying to post a review of this movie is almost impossible; something akin to remaking Godfather all over again. It would be an insult to the genius that is Christopher Nolan. I was bewitched from start to finish, from all possible perspectives be it story, screenplay, camera, music, acting - everything under the sun that is put into making a movie of this brilliance.Dom Cobb is an extractor, a person who owns the ability to penetrate dreams and steal ideas. Hired by a Japanese tycoon, Saito, he assembles a crew with individual capabilities to aid him in the ultimate deception - inception. Inception is planting an idea as opposed to stealing an idea.The first half sets the speed and the concept. In fact the whole of the first part of the movie did what Matrix tried to do in three versions. It was complex, almost utter nonsense but believable and direct.It is in the second half that the complications start and the director explores all possibilities of the ground rules of the concept that he had just lain foundation to. The movie peaks and falls at the right times, with the climax bringing the ultimate reasoning behind it all - which is even more convoluted and has lead to multiple discussions.The one thing that struck me was that, all the actors are stellar ones, starting off with Leonardo Di Caprio, Joseph Gordon Lewitt, Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard. But the fact remains, the director managed to outshine them all, easily, as if he was doing it in his dream.'Memento', 'Insomnia', 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Following' all seem to be leading up to this movie which has the traditional Nolan checklist of a non-linear narrative, intertwined plots, intelligent dialogues and enough action.A movie that balances entertainment and intelligence with heavy doses of either.

"Dear Christopher Nolan.Like Lenny feels compelled to search for the murderer of his wife in Memento considering even when he realizes the truth, as compelled have I been to write to you about a personal catharsis I've had and still am going through that you indirectly have contributed to help me define and following changing myself after immersivly enjoying Inception on a level I never thought possible. The playful ending with the top in Inception and the following endless discussions is simply reminded me of The Prestige; ""They want to be fooled"" and the mass audience are showing some weird and funny theories of reality and dreams regarding Inception. Incredible how a movie can mess with someones mind. Shame is that people don't discuss the brilliance of the movie as much as its ending. But perhaps thats what you aimed for, I have a radical notion. In some years to come perhaps the mass audience will look past the top and truly recognize the simple, yet powerful truth. Life now feels like a dream, I gotta be asleep to believe it. These past 9 months..so much have transpired. And I've been on and off about sending this letter. I could write a novel about what more has happened, and I think I will end up doing that someday. Its just hard as hell to remember where to begin. Im most happy my sister returned after living abroad for 10 years. And she and my mom have been my Ariadne's in the wake of this awakening. My sister reminded me of SO much from my childhood, helping me put a lot of the puzzles back and see the real truth.The Batman trilogy has ultimately led to me understand that my brother has truly been a father to me more than my father ever was. He has been my superhero through my youth. I just did not understand the value in that he was carrying a mask to protect and shield his dearest ones. And am forever grateful for him, and I cannot delve into his soul like Bane did, because taking his mask off will most likely be catastrophic for everyone around him. I believe firmly he will endure it, and be the same protector and father for his son. Thank you Christopher. Im looking forward to a new beginning to this old soul. You are for me, the Tesla of filmmaking.-Kjetil.",1
Could watch this over and over again if I could More films should be made l Me this,1
"I have seen this movie around 10-15 times, and every time I see it i discover something new and interesting. The story has one of the best story lines and the connection between the actors Morgan Freemam(Ellis Boyd Redding)and Tim Robbin(Andy Dufresne) is wonderful. The Shawshank Redemption shows what does go on in prison and sort of makes you think hows some normal people can become wise and crafty convicts. This movie somewhat reminds me of another great movie ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" in that the character can go from completely normal to somewhat nuts. And the cruel institutes in which people are put in, make excuses for their wrong doings, and treat people like they are dirt. I truly enjoyed this movie, and for whoever is reading this i'm sure if you see this movie, you will enjoyed just as much as i have.",1
"All thing in this movie is perfect, i love it and I watch it so many times and never get bored.",1
"Most defiantly not 1 of the best movies/...
While in many ways presents things I...n A different light it's not that amazing... If you'd ask me... (without giving spoilers) the movie in general... humanizes prisoners much much more then most prison movies (a especially for the time and...)
and that's why I believe it snowballed so much attention and simply caught on
but at the end of the day it's not that original it's not that good... It's fine even a good movie but not a 10 or a 9 not even a 8....it's Unbelievably over rated...
you should watch it.... but after you do think before you rate go over the plot again and.... there's also a need to separate the ending from the movie it's self.... again at a closer look it's not that! amazing... good but over rated....",1
Its great i would watch it again id righly reccromend it,1
"I was totally entertained by this complex movie with some surprising twists and a novel idea made completely believable. We (4 of us) enjoy sci-fi, which might be a must. People who cannot suspend belief wouldn't enjoy this movie (or many others that come to mind). I was worried that there wouldn't be enough explanation for some viewers - those who have trouble catching onto what is going on when a movie is fast-paced and has a lot of twists, but the writers did a great job with that. Even my elderly mom would enjoy watching this movie. It's refreshing to have some complicated suspense as to what is happening and what is going to happen. The clever plot kept you on the edge of your seat (at least it worked for our group). I would definitely enjoy seeing ""Inception"" again -- a rarity for me.",1
"Few careers are as remarkably unique as Christopher Nolan's: in only 12 years he's moved from the likes of Following, his debut feature which was shot during weekends for over a year, to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, movies that transcend their ""genre"" roots and become great pieces of drama and cinema, conquering critics, awards and audiences (a billion dollars and counting for The Dark Knight). And in between these bigger projects, there are smart, compelling works like Memento and The Prestige, expert lessons in storytelling and filmmaking that, on some levels, are as much about Nolan himself as they are about the characters populating those fictional universes. And then there's Inception, a rarity among summer blockbusters in that it has a considerable budget (close to 200 million dollars), but also an intelligent, layered script which demands attention from the viewer (though not quite to the same degree as, say, The Matrix). It is also, arguably up to this point, Nolan's magnum opus.Given the director's secretive attitude throughout production, the less said about the plot, the better, apart from some basic information: The main character, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a man who specializes in stealing elements from other people's dreams, thanks to a technique he has perfected over the years and a team of accomplices (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy, among others). He's also haunted by visions of his dead wife (Marion Cotillard) and some dark secrets that prevent him from going back home. Then one day he is asked to do the opposite of his standard MO: this time, he has to plant an idea into the subject's mind. No longer extraction, but inception...From the start, it is clear that Inception is far from the average sci-fi thriller: the opening act alone is a masterclass in narrative deception, thanks in no small part to Nolan's decision to avoid any visual gimmicks - color or format shifts - to separate the real world from the dream-scape. The truth is in the most minute details, and spotting them isn't easy. If The Prestige was a not-so-subtle metaphor for Nolan's filmmaking (the structure of the magic trick mirrored his handling of the plot), the concept is taken even further in Inception, where the maze (i.e. the layout of the dream) constructed by Page's Ariadne (a highly symbolic name, taken from Greek mythology), reflects the director's visual storytelling, with a masterful use of inter-cuts and music to guide us through his own cinematic labyrinth.At the same time, the film also has to deliver on the action level, and it truly does: this is equal parts Memento (each scene clarifies or even contradicts the previous one) and Batman Begins (a fact that is slyly referenced in the casting of Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine), with explosions, chases and shootouts that complete the story rather than being autonomous bits of film. From an impressive hotel set-piece that bears comparison with The Matrix (the big difference being that Nolan uses CGI as sparingly as possible) to the magnificent shot of a street defying the laws of physics, everything serves the story and its dream-like scope (the real reason Nolan waited almost a decade to actually make a film). As for the movie's human center, a necessary element to make the whole thing work on an emotional level, the doomed romance between Cobb (a superb DiCaprio who just keeps getting better) and his wife (kudos to Cotillard for giving such soul to a character that isn't, strictly speaking, real), is the summation of the director's filmography, from Memento to The Dark Knight via The Prestige: amidst all the spectacle and philosophy, it's the people that matter.Inception is with no doubt one of the year's - heck, even the decade's - best films, complex but also hugely exciting and rewarding, a piece of work that stimulates eyes, brain and heart and also embodies the essence of Stanley Kubrick's famed view on cinema: watching a movie is like dreaming.",1
The Best Batman Film ever made! Heath Ledgers take on the joker is inspirational and incredible! He takes the role to an entirely difderent LEVEL and may never be topped! A must watch film for any film lovers!,1
"Basic Rundown of My Score-Sound-8 Visuals-7.5 Plot-7.5 Acting-7.5Score-7.5Let me start out by saying Fight Club is neither completely about fighting or Brad Pitt. Keep in mind that this is more of a movie about Norton's character, the Narrator, and his discontentment with an every-day middle-class American lifestyle. Not only does Norton play this character with skill, he provides a mindset most everyone can relate too. The basic plot line in Fight Club (as basic as I can make it) is about a discontented office worker (Norton) who, through strange coincidence, meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), a reckless soap salesman with a strange fascination for explosives and street fights. Norton finds an almost religious escape with the fights, and soon they gather a large following that they deem the Fight Club. Fight Club is appropriately rated ""R""-there are some of the most brutal fight scenes in this movie I have ever seen. You'll see more blood on screen here than in most war movies. One scene in particular was highly disturbing, and there are many where men are beat within inches of their life. But therein lies the intriguing part of this movie-the number of people who found a strange euphoric solace in the brutal, merciless atmosphere of the underground fights. There are few personal fights in this movie-and yet the anger that flows from the members of this outlaw club is as real as it gets. The actors with stark realism portray men at the edge of their sanity-needing more relief than any class can provide. So instead of focusing on the fights themselves, Fight Club focuses on the desperation of people in American society. It represents many suppressed desires, fears, and the general curiosity that average people hold. If that was Fight Club's goal, it succeeds. Another area that Fight Club excels in is portraying a dark, desperate atmosphere. Even Tyler Durden's insane antics don't lighten up the mood. You want to laugh at some scenes, yet almost all of the humor in this movie is bitter-sweet. This is kept up from start to finish with amazing pace. You never feel rushed to the next scene, instead the movie flows evenly throughout. Fight Club may not be for everybody, but if you have time to sit down and follow its complex plot, it comes highly recommended from me.",1
"After seeing the film for the third time this evening, I've came to a solid conclusion. Most of the movies that we consider the best of all time contain a good amount of inner symbology. The Dark Knight not only has the simple symbol of the bat, but a plot that, to me, can easily be taken in as symbolizing the current America/Middle East situation. Joker of course being the terrorist, holding his own twisted beliefs on planning and chaos. Batman, meanwhile, representing the American government along with Harvey Dent. Most Americans don't agree with America's status in its war against terror and especially the PATRIOT ACT. Hmm....perhaps Batman using every cell phone within Gotham as a too to spot the Joker symbolizes the PATRIOT ACT and its infringement on our privacy???Most people didn't believe Batman was doing the right thing, however, he could indeed make the choice no other man could make as Alfred put it. This could easily symbolize our American Government and their great power and struggle to deal with the average Americans' feelings and beliefs. Batman indeed felt that he was doing the thing that would do the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people. However, it's clear in The Dark Knight that Batman is doing the right thing. But me being the liberal I am, I can't say I believe in what our government is doing....I would be interested to hear what the Nolan bros would have to say about this symbolism theory.",1
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.
The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, drinks etc. So one day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.",1
"I was really nervous to watch this because I didn't really understand it from the description and I don't like to watch trailers because they usually spoiler. So, when I did end up watching, I made the best decision in my life. It literally is one of my favorites movies because of everything it is. The plot is planned out so good that you could watch it over and over and over again and learn more and understand stuff. It's crazy good.",1
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" starts off with the familiar brutality of a prison movie. Convicted in the late 1940s for the murder of his wife and her lover, banker Tim Robbins is thrown into the slammer (the Shawshank penitentiary in Maine) for two consecutive life sentences.Seasoned inmate Morgan Freeman_the narrator in this story_watches as the soft-spoken, vulnerable prisoner undergoes the inevitable gang rape. Prison, Freeman tells the audience in that inimitably authoritative voice, ""is no fairy tale world.""In this case, he's dead wrong. "" Shawshank, "" based on Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" is a complete fairy tale, a sentimental yarn full of the darndest twists and turns since Frank Capra rolled his cameras. Cinematographer Roger Deakins's images are burnished with that ""long time ago"" golden glow, the inmates are_ultimately_a bunch of cute pushovers, and the worst thing about prison (give or take an initiation rape or three) is the boredom.""In prison,"" intones Freeman, ""a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied."" What Robbins, who has proclaimed his innocence all along, does to keep his mind occupied is the punch line of the story.The institution is run by warden Bob Gunton, a clichéd sociopathic despot who likes beating prisoners to death (to make a point) but will not abide religious blasphemy. Gunton is enthusiastically supported by sadistic guard Clancy Brown, who enjoys a regular round of assault and battery himself.But it's clear from the start that Robbins, despite the hardships, is emotionally protected by his own innocence. He charms everyone and, eventually, parlays his business skills into a useful commodity. By the end, these grim authoritarians and jailbirds are eating out of his hand. In fact, Robbins's effect on everyone is so cheesily messianic, they should have called this ""Forrest Gump Goes to Jail.""Speaking of jail, ""Shawshank""-the-movie seems to last about half a life sentence. The story, chiefly about the 20-year friendship between Freeman and Robbins, becomes incarcerated in its own labyrinthine sentimentality. It wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on the aforementioned finale. And leave it to pandering, first-time director Frank Darabont to ensure no audience member leaves this film unsure of the ending. Heaven forbid a movie should end with a smidgen of mystery!Still, although ""Shawshank"" gradually deteriorates (or, if you're a sentimentalist, gets better and better), there are things to be enjoyed. The principal performances are the most obvious pleasures. Robbins _with those bulging baby blues and that voluptuous baby mouth_exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell this tall tale.As for Freeman, he's a master of comedic and poignant cadence. He could read the local real estate listings and make you weep_or laugh. ""These walls are funny,"" he intones. ""First you hate them. Then you get used to them. After time passes, you get so's you depend on them."" From Freeman, these words read like existential thunder.When Robbins, upon making Freeman's acquaintance, asserts that he's innocent of the double murder, Freeman smirks. ""You're going to fit right in,"" he tells Robbins. ""You know that everybody in here's innocent?""",1
"I apriciate Christopher Nolan using practical effects over CGI,all around great performances.But plotholles limit me from giving it a higher score!",1
"No movie can ever match standards set by its story, direction, cinematography and heath ledger's acting. This ingenious movie will make you think twice about society and your conscience..Nolan's masterpiece will continue to amaze future generations. Although no money and prayer can bring heath ledger back to life to receive all his 20 awards for portraying joker impeccably but world will always remember his act which still questions our mind.",1

I'm really missed you (Mr.J).",1
"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic.",1
"Even though comic book movies are now a staple of the industry and one of the most popular genres at the box office, produced by the dozen every year with huge budgets, A list actors, groundbreaking special effects, whole cinematic universes build around them, filled to the brim with fun scripts and lovable characters, some of which are well received by the critics and the general audience alike, nothing tropes Christopher Nolan's second entry in the Dark Knight saga. It is just incredibly well made with amazing shots, stunning special effects which hold up to this day, perfectly scored, it has a dark entertaining story, great camera work. top notch editing and one of the best movie villains of all time. It is rightfully considered not just the best comic book movie ever made but also one of the best action movies in the history of cinema.",1

"This film is probably my favorite of all time. Almost everything about this film is perfect. The cast is phenomenal, and Nolan brings out the best in every actor. The script is airtight, leaving time for some less intense parts, while still having the density all Nolan films have. The score is amazing, and brings out all of the best action scenes. Having watched the movie over and over again, it still holds up, and upon each watch I'll notice something new.",1
"This is more of an appreciation to ""The Shawshank Redemption"", as if there were a high score than 10, I would have clicked it. In the history of penitentiary films, this one is on my top list, moreover, I find it a little influenced by the story of Papillon, however, have not read about this inspiration; thus if it exists, I would be proud of my theory.",1
"After waiting for more than a year, the wait is over. I feel like a ten-year-old kid waiting for Christmas day.In my opinion, The Dark Knight is truly a masterpiece. Forget Spiderman, Ironman, X-men, (insert any superhero movies here). They cannot be compared to this latest creation from Mr. Nolan! Every aspect in the movie is meticulously planned and well-executed.All characters are well-played, especially the Joker. Please just give this guy a statue already! Kudos to whoever could pull off that kind of character. Heath's joker makes Jack Nicholson's joker look like Mini-me. In one-word, it's just mind-blowingly flawless! To sum it up, The Dark Knight is one of the best movies in the decade. Go & watch it, people! It's worth every penny! Christopher Nolan is a genius!!",1
"This is a brilliant movie, it really goes deep inside the decay of society as Tyler Durden or the people of the U.S. sees it. Every word he says in his speech about we as middle age men or young adults, have no great war or no great depression, all of it is true, every word. We as people living in America right now, we have nothing to look forward to, maybe somebody's birth day or Christmas, but what do we really have. The government has us so tightly bound it is ridiculous, trying to control everything from wearing seat-belts and the video games we play to the control of other governments in other countries. This movie is almost a way to run your life with the whole ""its only after we've lost everything that we are free to do anything."" That is my opinion on this Great movie.",1
"Fight Club tells the story of a boring man with a dull life who meets an eccentric soap salesman named Tyler Durden. The two become friends, and end up starting a ""fight club"". A place where men can vent their anger by beating the crap out of each other. As the movie moves on, the fight club gets larger until it evolves into a terrorist organization, and a shocking twist ending reveals that Tyler Durden is more than he appears. Fight Club is a very interesting film. It's a film I recommend seeing more than once to take it all in. I recall not liking it at first, but when I saw it again, I took it for what it was. A brutally violent and in your face drama/comedy that deals with many of life's problems.The always amazing Edward Norton plays the nameless lead role in the film with Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. They both play their vastly different roles well, and the relationship between them is more believable than most movies about two friends. The writing and the build up to the ending are crafted so well that you almost get drawn right into the film. Fight Club is a dark and disturbing film that requires a thinker to view it properly. Very good.8/10",1
"Dreamland is something that has not been thoroughly researched so far, because it exists in our minds. It is too difficult and dangerous to thoroughly understand the dreamland. The director Christopher Nolan fulfilled all our imaginations of dreams through this film. Is it a dream in reality or a reality in dreams.
After watching the movie, I was surprised at the imagination of Christopher Nolan. 6 layers of dreams. Through subconscious dreaming, one layer is more dangerous than the other, and the time of each layer is superimposed on the time of the previous layer. Through the implantation of the subconscious, the dreamed subject has an idea that does not belong to him. In the deepest part of the dream, Limbo is a country that will make people lost. Dreams can go against all common sense, or beauty, or danger, and leave us infinite reveries.
Even though Mal in the movie knew it was a dream at first, he still fell into it, lost his child, lost his life, and lost his faith. It became a nightmare and appeared in Cobb's dream. It was this nightmare that brought deadly danger to their mission.
The most powerful thing about this movie is the alternation of reality and dream. When you dive deeper, you can't tell whether the surroundings are true or not. In the face of beautiful things, you don't feel trapped and you don't want to wake up. But we must remember that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is not a reality after all.
In our lives, we are all looking forward to a world like dreams, everything goes well, and everything goes well, but these are non-existent. I have not tasted a sweet and bitter life and cannot call it a life. The film uses imagination to solve a difficult problem for us. The key to distinguishing between reality and dreams is not actually a gyro, but a desire for the dreams you want to achieve.",1
You can see the best Joker ever. The fights between Batman and Joker is really good . The smart director make with the perfect career in the writing made the story line so exiting. And also the casts are talented enough to make this movie one of the best films ever. The most important Charecter is joker.In my opinion the joker causes to this film be one the best,1
"Inception (2:28, PG-13) _ 9 _ Science Fiction; biggie; original2009 was an amazing year for SF&F movies, with 7 original films (Avatar, District 9, Inglourious Basterds, Inkheart, Star Trek, Up, and Watchmen) getting my top rating of 9. 2010 so far has been disappointing, with only 4 (How To Train Your Dragon, Kick-Ass, Shrek Forever After, and Toy Story 3) getting as high as 8. But the dry spell is finally over, and in absolutely smashing fashion.Christopher Nolan has a grand total of 9 films to his credit, but they include such outstanding productions as Memento (2000), The Prestige (2006), and The Dark Knight (2008). Furthermore, in addition to directing, he co-wrote the screenplays for those movies with his brother Jonathan. They were marvels of intricacy, with layer upon layer of hidden meaning and nuance, slowly revealed as the story progressed. Now, as solo screenwriter and director, he has produced a masterpiece, the mind-blowing Inception.He takes an idea which I 1st read about in Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize_winning 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, and turns it into a riveting drama. Hofstadter wrote about a storyteller who gets his protagonist to a cliff-hanger point in a story, then has him start telling another story, which in turn leads to its own crisis, and then again, and then again. After the crisis is resolved at the final, deepest level, we go up and up and up again, and finally out. Only then does Hofstadter call our attention to the fact that we went down 4 levels but only came back up for 3 of them.Nolan uses this same idea (along with some Escherian visuals) with a wrinkle: It's not a story, it's a dream, and the dreamers are wired together so they share each others' experiences. Furthermore, there's a time-dilation effect (familiar to most people from their own dreams at least as far back as Mark Twain's ""The Great Dark"") in which an hour in dreamland is only 5 minutes in the real world. And if a person in dreamland goes into a deeper dream, the effect is compounded, so that a seeming lifetime can pass during only a short nap.In the near future, a small coterie of researchers has gotten good at this, and they make some shady money extracting hidden memories from the subconscious of people whose dreams they invade. Then a new proposition comes along. Wealthy power-company tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants to do the opposite _ not to retrieve a memory but to plant one in the mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), the heir to the rival Fischer-Morrow Corp. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is confident it can be done, despite the misgivings of the rest of his team, but he warns that it will require going down multiple layers, for 2 reasons: (1) the new idea has to be so subtly insinuated that the target will think he came up with it himself, for reasons he would find credible, and (2) Fischer has undergone training to resist this very kind of dream incursion, and his subconscious comes equipped with alarms and security guards to snap him out of any ordinary dream state.But wait, there's more! Normally, when you're ""killed"" in a dream, you just wake up. But this endeavor involves not merely multiple levels but also a powerful anesthetic, and the combination means that anyone ""killed"" in dreamland will stay there forever, in a kind of limbo, lost to reality.And still more! Cobb's dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) shows up every time he enters dreamworld, whether he's the primary dreamer himself or piggybacking on someone else's. Even tho she's just a figment of his imagination, he's got a really GOOD imagination, and she has her own reasons for wanting to keep him in the dream state, so she's always trying to thwart his best-laid plans. So Cobb himself can't have TOO much knowledge, in his waking state, of whatever imaginary world they're planning to take the target into. But, while he recognizes this in himself and compensates for it, he has other blind spots that could endanger his entire team. Fortunately, he's engaged the brilliant young architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) to design his mazes for him, and she tumbles to some of his personal demons.But wait, there's STILL more ?And so it goes, layer upon layer, complexity atop complexity, and you start to think you shouldn't be able to tell the players without a scorecard, but somehow Nolan gives you just enuf visual cues to help you keep straight at least 4 simultaneous story threads, as he intercuts rapidly between them.It is a tour de force, the best SF&F movie of the year. It's not for slow learners, but anyone who's easily bored will have absolutely no problem staying awake. Indeed, after this, you may be reluctant to ever fall asleep again.",1
"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",1
"It's a wonderful movie , i enjoyed every second of every scene i watch . I would like to thank everyone who contributed to presenting such a masterpiece.",1
"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.",1
"Ingeniously devised. Intricately built. Executed with a master craftsman's precision.Inception is basically a heist movie set within the world of dreams. It follows a crew of thieves who manipulate and create dreams in order to capture information from an unsuspecting mind.In itself, thats a nice concept, but the real beauty of this film is in it's execution. By the final stages of the film, you can see the set-up. It's so majestic, that even though you know what is happening, it is a joy to watch it unfold. It's like a puzzle that is amazing in it's pieces as well as the final picture.Christopher Nolan has a talent for creating amazing stories. As if that wasn't enough, he also has an incredible skill at creating a complicated and yet simple narrative.Don't believe anyone who tells you this film is hard to follow. It take more than just slouching in the seat, but it guides you so nicely. Don't expect a mindless action movie. This is a fascinating journey that is beautiful even when you know all it's parts.10 out of 10.",1
"First off, I fully enjoyed this movie, the actor was great, action scenes were nice, the Joker was totally insane, and a lot of villains that I loved.However, I felt Nolan tried too hard to please his fans and include everything in the movie. My problems: #1. Too drawn out: The movie felt very long. Nolan had too much happening to keep the movie nice and simple and just keep adding more and more as the audience watched.#2. Too many climaxes: Often, in a movie, you have one climax then the conclusion. In this movie, in one part I thought was the end of the movie, was only half, and it did this a number of times, making the movie feel very long.#3. No clear objective: In action movies, you have a upcoming disaster (be that natural, human, terrorist attack etc etc.) and your hero attempts to stop it. In this movie, Nolan fails to actually draw out the pending disaster and just keeps throwing out obstacles out of the blue. This makes the movie feel longer than it is, and like #2, leads to multiple times you think is the climax of the movie.All 3 points are pretty much related. Also, I don't like how they used one of my favorite villains, very quick cameo and very easy to take down, did't like that.BUT, all that aside, it still was an entertaining movie and I say, its worth your money. I'm not sure if its worth my 3rd time but I wouldn't mind seeing it again and watching the crazy Joker on screen.",1
Great movie overall. By far the best movie that DC has ever managed to produce.,1
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years A great movie unrepeatable, The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation",1
I will get straight to the point. This movie was made with very careful attention to detail. According to the Formula of life (Time + Effort = Value) It fits perfectly. Unfortunately the fault I found with this movie was in the thought process behind the acting. I was never sure of where any of the actors stood with themselves or each other meaning the movie's great twist at the end had no meaning. Acting only ever needs to be amazing but the story needs to be exceptional because in real life people don't act extraordinarily its the story of peoples lives which touches us the most because everyone can relate or compare their story the acting is just according to the actor. But other then that it was interesting to watch not so much enjoyable which is always sad.,1
"The Nolan's Inception has similar inviting conceptualisms as does The Wachowski's The Matrix, but it just doesn't have any of the cool bullet dodging or adequate proper inspiration, which is to say the action is sub-par in this masterpiece gone awry, lost in limbo to say the least and to say the most, I think that if there would of been just a little bit more of a discern to entertain as the overall main objective of the movie and perhaps maybe even to shift the primary focus of the film a tad more towards the action orientations of the dreamworld as opposed to the overkill of dwelling upon the complexities of being in control of your own dreams and the unknown aspects of the human subconscious then Inception would be timeless. (I'd appreciate way more fighting and adventure and ACTION here and running away from bad guys I love how the enemies appear largely as faceless people coming out of nowhere but there's not enough of it also way, way, way, way forever way less explaining how it all works and more cool action scenes/Leo's character = too much talky & not enough doey) It still is timeless. I love Inception! It's a bit unimaginative! I'm not being nitpicky here, Inception is a surefire classic, obviously (I love Leo!), I'm just pointing out here that The Matrix is way cooler than this movie is (I love Keanu!) and will ever be but I still love it! Inception's great! It possessed a seemingly undeterred route to live on in infamy (they thought up the hard part) as this movie has stretches, bursts if you will of extreme utter sheer brilliance but everybody is wearing like suits, all suits, only suits and acting all rigid-like and it's sort of hard to follow honestly and stuff like what a waste of dream space. Inception isn't too rewatchable over the years and the most interesting part of the story (Leo's tormented love for Marion Cotillard who I love!) lacks life and spirit and meaning and fire. Ellen Page is awesome in this movie she really is what a great performance from her. I love Ellen! I love Leo and I really love Marion too. I love the rest of the cast as well. Thank you! Inception's an original mind bend that motivates you, awes you and leads you on straight down into the deep abyss of nothingness (a merry chase) like it goes nowhere (too much sitting, not enough kick, if you will)! 8 out of 10. I love all the stars! Inception is brutally good only very void!",1
"Great actors, great story, great film. Every second is engaging and keeps you on your toes til the end.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,brilliant performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful and memorable score. All of those elements make The Shawshank Redemption not only one of the best Stephen King adaptations but a movie that is cinema at it's best.Based on the Novella Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King,The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins),a banker who is serving two life prison sentences for killing his wife and lover(although he claims he's innocent)at Shawshank prison. While at the prison Andy meets fellow inmate Red(Morgan Freeman)a man who can get things inside and the two form a long friendship while dealing with life in Shawshank prison.Released in 1994,The Shawshank Redemption is a truly brilliant and outstanding film that was the directorial debut of Frank Darabont and his first feature film adaptation of a Stephen King tale. Despite receiving rave reviews from critics and earning 7 Academy Award nominations The Shawshank Redemption wasn't a huge hit at the Box Office and was overshadowed by other classic movies released the same year such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. But thanks to television showings and success on Home Video The Shawshank Redemption became a classic and one of the most memorable movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is an instant classic the first time you watch it and is a movie that is powerful and dramatic,meaningful and gripping,uplifting and sad as well as humorous and light. All of those elements give Shawshank Redemption an emotional weight that reminds viewers why film is such a beautiful art form because it's a film where just everything works from the direction,acting and writing where everything is flawless. The Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie that has some of the grit and brutality of other prison movies but the storyline is much different and unpredictable than other prison films with messages and themes that are repeated throughout such as hope,life and optimism despite being in prison and dealing with the hardships. It's rare to see or hear such themes talked about in a prison movie but that is one of the things that makes Shawshank stand out from the other movies in the prison genre. Shawshank also shows viewers what a talented and versatile writer Stephen King truly is showing us that King can not do Horror and Science Fiction but can also do Drama. Shawshank along with other great Stephen King adaptations such as The Green Mile and Stand By Me are prime examples that King can do Drama. Shawshank also deals with not only prison life but also the passage of time going from the 1940s to the 1960s with posters of beautiful and sexy actresses such as Rita Hayworth,Marliyn Monroe and Raquel Welch showing that while time stands still in prison the world can move pretty fast. The pace of this movie is just terrific going by fast making you feel like you're watching a 90 minute film than a 2 and half hour one. The screenplay by Frank Darabont is amazing and memorable with dialog that is fresh and powerful as well as memorable and thoughtful. Shawshank's two main characters Andy and Red are classic characters who are the anchors of the film showing viewers the kind of friendship that lasts a long time. Andy and Redd look at prison life in different ways,Andy despite serving a life sentence believes that there is still hope beyond the prison walls and no one not the warden or the guards can't touch inside of him. Whereas Red is opposite and more cynical believe there is just prison life and that's all there is. However,despite their opposite ways of thinking Andy and Red's friendship and bond is strong and grows as the film goes on and when you see these two throughout the movie you will feel that there is redemption and hope for Andy and Red. Andy and Red is one of the best depictions of friendship in movie history and you will never forget these characters after the film is over. The final 20-30 minutes of The Shawshank Redemption is one of greatest endings ever seen on film because there is surprises and happiness that will make you smile and cry with joy. A masterful conclusion.The cast is outstanding. Tim Robbins is excellent and at his best as Andy Dufresne,with Robbins bringing a power and emotional depth to the performance. Morgan Freeman is brilliant and his best as well as Red,Andy's best friend and prison mate. Robbins and Freeman are magical together and have great scenes. Bob Gunton is fantastic and memorable as Wardon Norton,a corrupt prison Wardon. William Sadler is terrific and funny as Heywood,Andy and Red's friend and fellow prisoner. Clancy Brown is amazing and menacing as Captain Hadley,a Shawshank's brutal guard. Gil Bellows is sensational as Tommy,a young convict. James Whitmore is outstanding as Brooks,an old timer and prisoner. Mark Rolston(Bogs),Larry Brandenburg(Skeet),Brian Libby(Floyd),Neil Giuntoli(Jigger),David Proval(Snooze),Joseph Ragno(Ernie)and Jeffrey McDunn(1946 D.A)give good performances as well.The direction by Frank Darabont is fantastic and stunning,with Darabont moving the camera with tracking shots,low angles with beautiful and harsh lighting. Great direction,Darabont.The score by Thomas Newman is terrific,beautiful and epic and is fits with the movie's tone. Incredible score,Newman.In final word,if you love Tim Robbins,Morgan Freeman,Frank Darabont,Stephen King,Prison Films or movies in general,I highly suggest you see The Shawshank Redemption,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you can watch again and again and is cinema at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",1
"In my opinion, one of the best films in the world. its realization impeccable and very current topic today. The human being as human being is the blood of the fighters of fight club; them shows that we are living and for a moment, only acts our real ""me"" without material prejudice of any kind, such as when our own lives we are in a critical situation where danger our lives, then we understand how fragile is life and the value. We often forget what truly we are, when cling us with our belongings that clouds the vision of balance that represents our live. Follow your dreams and your heart!PD: Sorry for my English, Is not the best",1
"The movie is an extraordinary piece of the filmmaking art in all its aspects, the plot is carefully and smartly written as a intricately wrought canvas, the character development is very satisfying, the movie was shot well and nicely directed, the epic score fits the scenes and add up to the whole visual experience, the acting was intense by all cast where each fit their role perfectly, specially Heath Ledger who managed after all these years of having the Joker around in comic books, animations, TV series and even movies to literally bring this complicated character with all its twisted, brilliant, sadistic, dark and sometimes funny personality to live on the big screen.",1

The acting from christian bale and heath ledger are 10/10 but the story is not better than 5/10,1
"Shawshank is unique in the genre and unlocked a new potential for movie makers to break the inherent confines of a prison picture. This was demonstrated later on with Darabont once again redefining the prison picture in The Green Mile - a classic in its own right. So why is Shawshank so popular and tops many best movie lists? Not hard to figure out. The entertainment value is high and our empathy is heightened for Andy and Red. A lot of deserved attention over the years has gone to Freeman, but Robbins carries his part just as well. We have to remember the Andy character is somewhat that of a semi-tough geek, which is a tough balancing act to portray - unless part of your own personality is much like that. Robbins impresses me for this and meets the expectation. But I think Freeman's character allows more scope for exceeding an expectation which is probably why Freeman is lauded a bit more. So Shawshank, after all these years, still awaits like a trap to ensnare new devotees. Another sign of its worthiness - it pulls you in quickly.",1
"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as ""the only guilty man in Shawshank."" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape. Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.",1
"This film is one of the best films I've ever seen. It gives you a realistic story line of how the prison system works. My friends first Persuaded me to watch it, while I thought it was going to be very boring, and now it is one of my favourite films. It makes you go on an emotional rollercoaster and the ending is so unpredictable. My friends and I still quote this movie and having seen it a hundred times we still all love it. It is a great film to watch with family and friends and is an all time classic to watch.",1
"The movie starts very strangely for the first time viewers, but when the movie goes foreword you will get it. Or will you.Inception is about sleep. How well do you know that you aren't asleep right now? Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) has a machine that will make you fall asleep and dream. You also need an architect that will make your dream.Inception has a massive list of stars; Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy etc. DiCaprio is the star in the movie, but there is also a very strong character that is played by Gordon-Levitt. Levitt is an actor from the hit TV-series called 3rd Rock from the Sun. After the show Levitt started in a very mediocre movies, but when you see him in this movie you want to see more of him.Cinematography is very difficult in a movie like this. It has ankles that no one has made before. Also the music by Hans Zimmer is beautifully crafted. Zimmer way is to make you feel like you are in the movie and he does it.The philosophical way of looking at this movie has a very strong appeal to every viewer. Philosophy has always got questions but never answers and that doesn't come out in the film. But if you look at the end of the movie, the very last scene, you have to ask yourself: What just happened?",1
"Based on the acclaimed novella by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is a film burning with a certain sense of triumph that is rarely experience in any cinematic effort. It is a drama that stops at just about nothing to grab at your heart while feasting it with a strong human touch. This effort is accomplished by director Frank Durabont who, in his directorial debut, grasps on a powerful hold on the spirit of Stephen King's original source material. Taking from the pages of the novella of the same name, the film sets its action inside the walls of the federal penitentiary, a dark place where some of the most innocent people are incarcerated while they hopelessly watch as they are robbed of their humanity at the hands of the unpleasant nature within the prison. While some are thrown in prison for their lack of innocence, others lose their innocence while serving their time within the barbed wire fences and rusty cells. The primary focus of this bleak, yet triumphant tale, however, is the man who vows to fight against this tragedy. Set in 1947, this film follows Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a man sentenced to forty years in prison after wrongly being accused of the murder of his cheating wife and his lover. Stationed at the Shawshank Prison in New England under the watchful eye of religious bible-thumping Warden Norton (played by Bob Gunton), Andy is forced to deal with the harsh reality of the prison life, but soon finds a glimmer of hope when he forms a bond with fellow prisoner under the nickname Red (played by Morgan Freeman) who claims to be innocent. Following his years in prison, Andy seeks for redemption and decency among his fellow prisoners while struggling to survive against the unpleasant lifestyle uprooted by Norton. One thing everyone in that prison has in common is that they are all innocent, at least according to Red in a scene upon meeting Andy for the first time. But does he truly mean? That question lies within the story as it proceeds through a long, yet thoughtful process of establishing the emotional nature of the characters and the soul- crushing environment that has them shaken to their cores. But as Red states, ""you become use to it"". Whether one can agree with Red's claims or not, it is his wisdom that establishes him as a character with an emotional force to reckoned with. And kudos can be given to Frank Durabont's absorbing script, this character would not the shining light he is without the outstanding performance by Morgan Freeman who amplifies the role is just enough emotional magnitude to tap at the heart, while also dominating the film with his narration. The bond between him and Tim Robbins strikes the chord in more ways than one, especially with Robbins embracing the role with pure grit. Andy is a tragic character who is forced to come to terms with the reality that innocence is lost regardless of when it is in your control, and that leaving does not always mark the end of your tragedy. One character in the film is forced to learn that the hard way in one heartbreaking sequence. The film never grabs at your heart with strangling you with forced sentimentality, it just allows its emotions to run wild while sprinkling small bursts of humor to occasionally lighten the tone. In the midst of the melancholy at defines the atmosphere, there is a powerful sense of hope that Andy will not let the prison become the thief of his dignity nor his humanity, particularly at the hands of Bob Gunton's Warden Norton, a corrupt individual tainted with his religious hypocrisy. How can one trust a man who shoves his bible in their face, yet expresses himself in such an inhuman manner? And for a technical standpoint, shout-outs go to Roger Deakins for his profound cinematography to capture the nature of each scene from start to finish. The Shawshank Redemption is a triumphant cinematic effort brimming with an uncompromising heart and sense of humanity within its roots. It is powerful picture that will leave you heartfelt one moment, then leave you choked up within the next. That is just an example how magnificent director Frank Durabont is at gripping you with such a strong human touch. Worthy of the name ""masterpiece""? I definitely think so.",1
"It wouldn't be wise to despise this at any case great movie. Still one may locate far too many ""weaknesses"" to put it right at the place and rank it would otherwise deserve to be, if a little more ""modesty"" was shown there: 1. Far as the script is concerned, this movie is based in concepts we have already been familiar with in earlier films (""dark city"", ""Matrix"", ""the fourth floor""). 2.In its effort to make its script original by moving forward these concepts to a further level, the movie turns to chaotic details, so many, that the poor spectator, continuously shelled with them and the terms which represent them, should keep a notebook to catch up with the story. Besides that, the development of the script is to an enormous (for a blockbuster) extend, based on lots of information that the spectator is provided with. Too much for him to fully process and assimilate to follow the movie without missing things and without gaps in his head about it. 3.The sentimental part of the story(the main character's personal drama), is far too much put aside compared with the action part, which is far too long, far too ""mission impossible"" style, far too chaotic due to the ""findings"" of the script as written above (...too many ""levels of dream"" I 'm afraid). So the spectator is left just with the central idea of the story leaving the rest for ? another time. For Christ, one doesn't go to the movies to make a thesis about the new topic ""inception"" introduces!!!! To tell the truth I had to watch the film 2 and ½ times to understand it to a satisfactory extend, though some questions still persist. It's a pity! ""Inception"" would deserve to be as deeply human and sentimental, as deeply emotional and touching, as lyric and elegiac as its ambiguous yet imposing ending suggests...",1
"When this came out in theaters, my brother and I went to see it three times! At first we really just loved it for its topsy-turvy story line, awesome fighting and anarchy theme. However, each time we watched it we peeled away the layers to see the deeper considerations of this film. When I bought it on DVD we would go over each scene looking for clues and hidden messages in this film to help us better understand it. In the end, this movie pulls you along a thrilling tale that subliminally reaches the depths of your inner rebel. This is one of the few movies that I still learn something new every time. Watch this film, and watch it many times. It is enjoyable every time and I feel you will also learn a lot about yourself, too.",1
"When first hearing of this movie. I automatically thought it was a movie about boxing and dismissed it. I'm glad I eventually took time to see it, because this is a film with a message that shoots straight to the heart of the problem with modern society. If you want to know why people walk into schools and malls and start shooting. This movie may give some insight. Fight Club is about a character lost in the corporate grind. Loosing himself with every email sent. Loosing himself with every report filed. Loosing himself to the tune of a copy machine. This leads him to found a club for men only. A fight club where men can find what it is to be human again. Through pain they break from the corporate treadmill and feel again.",1
This movie has it where it counts in every way. The action is amazing and is only used when necessary. This film plays out more like a crime drama rather then a comic book movie. Its highly enjoyable through the entire two and a half hour run time.It must be said that Heath Ledger does steal every scene and you are just waiting for him to pop back into the movie when he is not in it. Everything blends really well together from the cast to the music to the shots. It really is a great movie experience.There are a few small details of this movie that bother me. Just because the bring the movie back into comic book land and not a crime drama. Most of them towards the end.I also recommend that it should be scene on an IMAX screen because it makes the movie absolutely breathtaking. It is the best movie this year and should merit some Oscar consideration at the very least a Best Supporting nod to Mr. Ledger he truly is the joker.,1
"The idea was great. It makes you think, and the concept of inception is very refreshing. The film made you reflect deeply upon LIFE and question the very fabrics of reality and time.Well, not really.They sort of forwent that in favor of action. You know what I mean.Military-style fortresses with an abundance of patrol guards that somehow miss the protagonists from a couple meters away. Lots of cutting it close with plans that would fail if they were delayed by a couple more seconds. Blood. Bombs. Guns. Plot holes.I admittedly did enjoy the action, but I still feel a little cheated by how the producers evidently thought it was more important than the interesting premise. Still, they did expand upon the idea enough that it was a major part of the entire plot and certainly was quite a fascinating film anyways. I just think at least some of the action was a tad unnecessary.",1
"For the first time watchers the story starts with a lame and feels like boring. But it gradually picks up the pace after 15-20 Min's and every moment will be best. Tim Robbins acting is the best. The moral of this movie is always ""Hope for the Best"" Best will always come. You need to be a patience for it.If you watch the movie carefully there is a very good twist at the end which is not expected at all. Some of the famous TV series like prison break are based on this movie itself.Direction by Frank Darabont was simply superb. I can say that morgan freeman has given his career best performance in this movie.I would rate this 10 out of 10. Fantastic and all time top 1 movie.",1
"Back in 2005, I saw ""Batman Begins"" and fell in love with it: finally, a Batman that got the character and the world he lives in right, not a flawed live action cartoon. I thought things couldn't get any better.""The Dark Knight"" has proved me wrong. And I'm glad of it.For starters, this does what it's predecessor did and treats Gotham City and its inhabitants as if it was a real place. Our hero's gear and equipment have real world origins and explanations, not just something he pulls out of his utility belt and starts doing amazing things with. There are scenes of people reacting to situations as you or I would do, not a bunch of extras following the director's instructions. And there are real world complications that that many other versions of Gotham City didn't seem to have.Since there are some are some big twists the trailers and commercials avoided showing us, I'll try my best to keep this spoiler free. But the results of those twists have such a great effect on the plot I might go into detail about them, so be warned.Let's start with the thing on everyone's mind and talk about the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, not the mention the character himself. This is not your father's Joker. Everything about him is changed, right down to his origin. Instead of a career criminal who fell into a vat of chemicals that altered his appearance, we have have a psychopath with unique scars wearing clown make up. There are no gimmicky weapons here: no killer laughing gas, no electrifying joy buzzers, no acid squirting flowers, no guns with BANG flags. This Joker uses a variety of guns, knives and bombs that any criminal really could find and use. And he's no longer a criminal mastermind out to get as much money as possible and have fun committing crime. He's out to cause chaos and panic for his own twisted amusement, his attacks becoming increasingly destructive and deadly as they happen in ways that rival real world terrorist attacks. Later in, he's out to make turn the people of Gotham bad, forcing common citizens to do unthinkable acts in response to his terrible demands. And Ledger brings the character to life in way no other actor has ever done or will. The rumors he may win a posthumous Oscar have much truth to them. If you're one of those people who've always thought Jack Nicholson's Joker from the 1989 ""Batman"" was over the top and cartoonish, then watch ""The Dark Knight"" for the complete opposite.But Ledger isn't the only one doing a wonderful job here. Christopher Bale remains the best Bruce Wayne/Batman ever. Micheal Caine brings both humor and sincerity to Alfred. Morgan Freeman wonderfully shows us the mind (and heart) behind the Batsuit and those weapons and equipment. Gary Oldman gives one of the best performances in his entire career as a stalwart James Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a vast improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart brings charisma and courage to his role as Harvey Dent, which makes Dent's transformation to the scarred villain Two Face all the more horrifying and tragic (something Tommy Lee Jones didn't even try to do when he played the character in 1995's ""Batman Forever""). Even anonymous characters that only get a few minutes of screen time manage to leave an impression.But be warned: this movie lives up to its PG-13 rating. The violence here is fast and brutal. And even when bullets aren't flying and bombs aren't exploding, the tension is so thick it'll take a lot more than a knife to cut it. There are several jump out of your seat moments and some fairly disturbing scenes. During the last 30 minutes or so, I was on the edge of my seat, my heart constantly pounding and my eyes wide as I hoped for the best but expected the worse. If you have young Bat-Fans, you might want to pause before taking them to see this, or buying the DVD for them when it comes out. Even though the movie has toys and snack food tie ins, I wouldn't let a child under 11 or 12 see this. I imagine even some adult viewers won't be able to sit trough it without squirming in their seats a few times.My one true complaint is that ""The Dark Knight"" maybe TOO good, setting the mark a little too high for future Batman Movies. Even if they could find someone to replace Ledger to bring back the Joker, I'm not sure that actor could possibly fill the large shoes left to fill.""I think you and I are destined to do this forever"" The Joker leers at Batman at one point. If only that were true...",1
"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",1
"Even though the hype about ""Inception"" is being pushed in an abnormal way, you guys really need to calm down. First of all, I don't know where the problem about this movie is; it's a Hollywood movie, thus made in that exact manner. Second, many people complain about neither having' some really ""bad"" guys in Inception. Seriously? You need to have painted everything in white and black to appreciate the story? That, my dear friends, is what I call childish. As for the mixture of scenes and levels, maybe you should all watch the movie again really slowly, and think about each and every scene to get the point, alright? Something being complicated does not mean that you hate it just for the sake of you not having understood anything at all. Or read the wikipedia summary, if you're too dumb. One point many didn't understand was the even though there was no gravity in the first two levels, there still was some in the third one. You know why? It's even explained in the movie itself, Yusuf says that a strong sedative will be added for the deeper levels to stabilize them. And this is just one example: Lots of things you might think are strange really have a reason, you just have to look a bit closer. Finally, I agree that this is not the number 3 movie of all time, probably somewhere in Top 20 or Top 30, but certainly the best movie from 2010 and also from the last few years.",1
"Wow, what a ride. Just saw it for the first time, and even though it felt overly convoluted, the visual effects are pretty interesting as well as the story. It definitely should be on some of the bigger lists of the year for its look into the subject of lucid dreaming and for its original filmmaking. It's a bit hard to wrap your mind around what depths the movie goes for after only one viewing, but I cheated and read the plot on Wikipedia beforehand to know what cues to look for as well as to study where the team in the movie are going next.The believability of a man so consumed with his look into lucid dreaming and its involvement with his family life and legal status in the United States sounds simple enough on paper, but Nolan really reached ridiculously far out there to make the story twist around on itself, perhaps a little too much. As much as it's praised, I don't really remember the soundtrack at all, and why Nolan needed Hans Zimmer to pair with Johnny Marr I'll never understand. The ending was touching and it mirrored similar films such as What Dreams May Come, which I thought was very weird and coincidental.Anyways, I enjoyed it. I found it very enjoyable even though most of the parts dragged when it came to DiCaprio's character dealing with his projections of his wife. I found it was convenient the way Elle Page's character would end up finding a way into every aspect of Cobb's life in the first week of meeting the guy, too. So some of this story is lacking logic, but it is sci-fi and should be followed only for as long as the film allows. Overall, 7/10 stars because even if I don't watch it over and over again, I can respect the time put into the story and the technical achievements they made with its filming.",1
"The Dark Knight is so much more than a super hero movie. It is in every sense a generally pleasing movie. It is dark and disturbing yet extremely believably realistic. It takes all the elements that a fined tuned thriller should have and then takes them to a whole new level.The acting is all around phenomenal. Everyone goes straight to Heath Ledger, which is completely understandable, considering his performance is brilliant and without a doubt the best in the movie. However the other stars of the film have notable performances. Each person makes it so that after you have watched a scene with them, you want to see more of them. Christian Bale excels in his reprisal of Batman. While Maggie Gyllenhaal is outstanding as strong-willed Rachel Dawes. No what, I'm going to stop myself here because quite frankly there is too much to be said about the cast. Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freemon, and Gary Oldman all also succeed in making us believe that these characters and this world is real.The direction of the film by Christopher Nolan is everything you could ask from a director and oh so more. He brilliantly makes the stakes high, the action literally explosive, and the story dark, gritty and real. Each sequence builds on the previous to the point where you begin to ask yourself, ""How are they going to top this?"" Yet Nolan succeeds at making each sequence better, fresher, and more exciting than its predecessors. If I may be so arrogant, I believe it is a prime contender for Oscar nominations, not just for Ledgers performance, but also for best picture. The Academy should look past the fact that it is a super hero movie, and see the truth that it is an amazing movie with so many elements to take note of that it could be analyzed and discussed for decades to come. Even if you don't agree with this belief of mine, you should still agree its merits are noteworthy and that the film is definitely worth seeing. One of, not just, the Summers, but the years, best films. 10/10. How could anyone give this a one. It at least deserves a 7 or higher.",1
One if the best movie I've ever seen... Christian bale and Heath Ledger did well job. Hats iff to these guys... I've never seen batman series ever but coz of them i watch the while dark knighr trilogy... Hope we could see bale again reprising his role....,1
The Shawshank Redemption Is a movie in which the main character Andy ends up in jail. While in jail he suffer many hardships such as assaults etc. However he also makes some wonderful life friends and his soul mate portrayed by the excellent Martin Freeman who eventually helps Andy escape from Azkaban. This is one of the greatest movies ever defiantly worth a watch.,1
"Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",1
I love this movie <3 One of my favotite.Brad Pitt is just amazing playing his character soo well. The other actors great too. Im interesetd in psychology so this makes the movie even greater.,1
"Having been a bit late to the inception party, i was a bit dubious to watch it; I had frequently heard that it was very confusing and frustrating. However, having watched this i cannot find fault. The acting was amazing, and all of the leads produced convincing and strong performances. The storyline is easy to follow, and despite being labelled confusing, if you really watch and listen, pay proper attention, there should really be no reason to feel confused as it is explained really well throughout. The ending for me was a perfect way to end a film like this, i can't think of a better way to do so. Fantastic film, one of the best i have watched in ages.",1
"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope. Who is your Andy Dufresne?",1
"The dark knight is a great thoughtful potent movie.this was the first superhero movie that i watched seriously and believe me it really was incredible...i thought that superhero movie are only for kids...but Mr Nolan's batman movies create a lot of energetic content for adults...it really blew me...it has outdone batman begins in all aspects...i thought batman begins was best batman movie after batman returns but dark knight exceeded all my expectations and i must say it is one of the finest crime thrillers coming out from Hollywood,also what separates a good movie from a great movie is Performance...the joker has steal the acting crown of this movie,it was the best joker i have ever seen in batman movies its his best performance till date.the background score of this movie was also great. I have already watched it 30 times and i still want to see it again.",1
"Let me review this film on two aspects: it's merit and it's high placement.
First of all, ask yourself this question: Is a film great simply because it achieves? I hope many think this is not the case. Shawshank has a slow and methodical pace. Along with good performances around the board. The simple staging and lighting of the film is over-done in it's simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all. But, I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's not, and it's far from it. But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society.
The writing is top-notch. The best thing about the film is the flow of the story, and I could have simply read a book. I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced story-telling ... but I am a fan of art. Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film. Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered, but being delivered well.As for it's rating on the site ... the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it. It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons. Including murder, infidelity, and scandal. Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time, actually. So I dare not say this is a bad film; I only say it's ranked higher than vastly superior films.Rating: C+",1
I really love this movie one of the greatest movies ever,1
"Frank Darabont's work is amazing in this movie let alone Stephen king, incredible ... Since Tim Robbins (Andy) is in that car at night until Morgan freeman (Red) arrives at the Mexican beach all a thrill, intrigue you see on the screen. Geologist's hammer, the Rita Hayworth poster hanging on the wall in a miserable prison cell Shawshank an incredible idea of Stephen. For my part the movie is the best thing and seen the movie that hooked me more of screen a movie with 14 years spent enough. A life lesson that shows what can happen to oneself from one day to the other just to make a nonsense. Finally, Some 20 years turned into 2 hours, I recommend this movie to movie lovers. Greetings.German!",1
"This is one of the greatest movies ever. A really must see before you die!David Fincher is a very high skilled director. The leading actors of this movie are chosen very carefully and I guess this is Edward Norton's best actor performance.You can watch ""Fight Club"" more than once and you would never get bored of it.",1
"The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice ""inception"" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we're ""treated"" to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy's character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe's character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don't buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio's dream world.This isn't a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan's films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like ""Total Recall"" in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is a good movie. It has a good story and good acting. Though I don 't think that the movie is good enough to be at the top of the 250 list at IMDb. I think that it is a great ""prison movie"" but it's so similar to other books and movies like Midnight Express or The Escape From Alcatraz. A ""prison movie"" that is much better but doesn't get the glory and credibility is The Green Mile witch made me more emotional and excited. Compared with The Shawshank Redemption, The Green mile has a better storyline and most important an original prison story.The Shawshank Redemption is about man called Andy who is being wrongly accused for a crime that he didn't do. He was given two life sentences for killing his wife and her lover in cold blood. Therefore he is being sent to Shawshank Prison. Andy learns to adapt to prison life and he meets knew friends, but also enemies. The life in prison is hard and he meets a lot of obstacles as the story goes.As I said earlier, it is a good movie and you should see it if you haven't. However in my opinion it is too unoriginal and safe for the best film in history as many other think. By saying safe I mean that the director could have done something that had made me remember the film. Something out of the ordinary. Instead of the ""escape prison"" unoriginality. Cause now I think it's just a bland movie.Another thing that I think the movie misses is more fighting and crime. Isn't this a prison? Should it not have any sort of violent behavior? Sure Andy fights of a bunch of enemies in a few short scenes, but I don't think that that's enough. The thing is that Andy's enemies are the only bad guys in the whole movie. At least of what we see in this film. The film could have exploited more violence and crime, but instead we get a nice old man that feeds his bird. Andy's friends are so nice that I sometimes feel like they are workmates instead of committed criminals. When they are out in the yard all convicts are just playing ball and talking like they are having a lunch brake. I don't mean that all prisoners should just fight and swear but it could have least been one fight seen in the yard so you get a bit more of that prison feeling.In conclusion it's a good movie with some flaws. It's has many good scenes. Though in my opinion it fails because of its blandness and unoriginality. They should have put more effort in making something more memorable.Based on my judgment it's a 8/10 and I think that it's a fare rating. It should have its title in the top 250, but not the number one.//Swedish Critic",1
"""I choose chaos"", says the Joker in one of the early scenes in the movie and those words sum up what's in store in The Dark Knight. Directed by the supremely talented Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight is a masterfully woven tale of anarchy and heroism that captivates you right from the opening scene.The events of The Dark Knight take place a few months from where Batman Begins left off. Gotham City continues to be a lawless frontier where organized crime flourishes but billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is warming to the idea that the city may have found a hero in district attorney Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart). Enter Heath Ledger as The Joker! Don't let the name cuckold you. This Joker is no circus clown! He has no background and his origins remain a mystery. He is, to be put simply, an anomaly in a world constantly striving to be normal. The Joker does what he does best: unleashing chaos on the streets of Gotham city. Batman on the other hand is trying his best to clean the scum off the streets of Gotham. It is this yin-yang relationship between the caped crusader and his lawless adversary that forms the crux of The Dark Knight.Nolan manages to extract superlative performances from all his cast members. Christian Bale is solid and stoic as our caped crusader. Aaron Eckhart delivers a sterling performance. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine provide ample support. But it is Heath Ledger, playing the Joker with fire breathing abandon, who indisputably steals the show. Whether it's the opening scene where he's robbing a bank or when he's showing his little magic trick to the mob, Ledger shows how you need to be tightly wound up and totally in control even when delivering a crazy, out-of-control performance. As I had read somewhere _ he plays Forrest Gump gone mad, but with élan!To call it the best superhero movie of all time, would be the greatest disservice you could do to the genius of Christopher Nolan. The movie creates a place where good and evil _ expected to battle it on _ decide instead to get it on and dance. Brilliantly bleak and chillingly Gothic, The Dark Knight soars on the wings of Nolan's savage imagination!",1
"When I first saw the video for the Dark Knight, I decided that I would no longer watch other trailers, read spoilers, interviews and much more that appear before the release of each film and spoil the impression, revealing all secrets in advance. And as it turned out, I did not lose.The general plot of the film, I confess, was very surprised. If we consider that all the videos and information about the film were based only on the struggle of Batman and Joker, it was extremely difficult to predict the appearance of someone else, but the creators were able to show us not only this pair in all its glory, but also another character whose name - Two-faced. As it turned out, their roads are very closely intertwined, and one without the other and could not take a step, but this is personal opinion. However, this is not all, and everyone who decides to watch the film, is still waiting for a lot of surprises both on the characters appearing in the frame and their non-standard actions, and on the number of moments after which the captions would seem to go. Also, despite the almost constant action, there are feelings in the film that are impossible not to notice. The complex interweaving of beautiful fights, shootouts, car chases, deep thoughts and empathy - this is the basis of the plot.Christian Bale was able to repeat his previous success and played Batman in the existence of which one wants to believe. Despite the fact that the main features of the hero were calm and equanimity, Bale was able to show Bruce Wayne as a man with a soul and heart, who is just as peculiar to love, experience and fear, like any other person in Gotem.Heath Ledger did something that no one else could have done in his place - he created a really crazy, formidable, absolutely magnificent Joker who looks on the screen much more interesting and believable than the Joker Nicholson. The character of this character turned out to be surprisingly original, and the feelings that the Joker causes when watching a movie are comparable only to the feelings when you see Batman on the screen. For a long time I have not seen such a high-quality game, such a sensual and soulful belief in my own role. I am afraid that with the death of Ledger, Hollywood lost one of the few hopes for the revival of that sensuality in a game that was 20 years ago.Aaron Eckhart played two significant roles in this film, which eventually became one. His ""knight on a white horse"" seemed to me painfully good for the city, from which it smells like crime, but his two-faced turned out to be a very convincing and quite high-quality representative of the criminal elite, in whose presence there is a need.Gary Oldman played the role of Gordon convincingly enough, if not more, but he still didn't have enough. However, in spite of this, Oldman and the scriptwriters were able to show some interesting and unexpected aspects of this character, which pleased and upset me at the same time.It is unfortunate that Michael Kane, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman got such small roles in the film. However, the number of time spent by their characters on the screen does not nearly decrease their significance in the plot, because each of them played a role in the complex intertwined tangle of events, each of which is part of all the others.I was pleased with the appearance in the film of such actors as Cillian Murphy, Eric Roberts and especially William Fichtner. Despite their seemingly very modest roles, they added a kind of pleasant sensation to the film, because when you see actors on the screen familiar to you, it becomes somehow more pleasant, and you don't think ""who it is,"" but just watch and get pleasure.Special effects and graphics and other film-brightening details at a decent level. Living in the age of high technology, I have often seen films in which it was very difficult to distinguish graphics from real shots, but in Dark Knight I could not do it in principle. Even now, I can not answer the question ""Was she there at all?"" With one hundred percent certainty. Although, of course, there was no graphics, but painfully and imperceptibly, it fits into the natural environment surrounding it. Separately, I would like to mention the excellent work that stuntmen have done throughout the filming of the film. Looking at the various tricks shown in the film, I just want to say ""for an encore, please"".But what is it that I managed to tell about everything and everyone except the main person, thanks to whose efforts we see the ""Dark Knight"" the way we see it. This man's name is Christopher Nolan. Who is he? A simple American director who went all the way out when making the film and created an absolutely stunning film from the usual adaptation of the comic book, which, oh, how soon they will not be forgotten. The greatest merit of Nolman is that he managed in an unimaginable way to convey all the feelings of the inhabitants of the city, the panic and horror that engulfed them during the events in Gotema, and most importantly, he showed how calm the people and their actions depend on two people - Batman and Joker.",1
"There are parts of ""The Dark Knight"" that seize my attention - the Batpod chase, the Bats v. Joker interrogation, Batman's foray into China, and that opening bank heist was extremely well put together - but the movie from start to finish feels bloated and overlong. Part of the greatness of ""Batman Begins"" is that it was grand in scope without becoming top-heavy. I realize a major influence on ""TDK"" was the sprawling crime saga that is ""Heat"", but I'd rather watch that movie. Which isn't to say that this is a bad movie; far from it. So let's cut to the chase on where this movie delivers. The cast, once again, is incredible (Nolan was smart to surround himself with pros), the on- location footage goes a long way in the realism department, and the big action setpieces are pretty crazy. And then The Joker strolls onto the screen and boldly claims the movie for his own. Heath Ledger doesn't just dazzle in the role, he makes off with the movie like a crazed bank robber. Ledger's ballsy performance makes this clown both frightening and hilarious. He owns this movie - and that's saying heaps with a sterling cast like this. This is a textbook case of watching a gifted actor dominate the screen. 7/10Also, let's be honest, Bale's throat cancer voice was pretty effing bad.",1
"All in all,this is the best film ? have been seen in my life.I think that it covers action, psychology ,and philosophy at the same time that It is only the unique one in this aspect.I have been watched 4 or 5 times so far and never be bored with its.If a film includes action, it does not cover the philosophy or psychology but this cover all of them.That has also good and significant dialog braid.You should watch again and carefully.Look. The name of the movie is ""Fight Club."" It's got bare-knuckle fights in it. They're violent. They're bloody. Please don't come out of ""Fight Club"" whining about how violent and bloody it is. Got it?Violence and sex are two of the things people go to movies for. They aren't getting enough in their own lives.",1
"The Dark Knight was a theatrical masterpiece that is eschewed by some because they believe that comics are simply for children. Boy, are they wrong! This movie was a simply EPIC piece of cinema that shall not be soon forgotten! It is emotionally attaching, exciting, jaw-dropping, intense, futuristic. It will make you laugh and cry and cheer in the aisles! The actors were perfectly chosen, and Christian Bale is hands down the best Batman yet. He acted flawlessly as the intimidating, determined face of the batman. The voice, the costume, the hero, the billionaire, all were executed perfectly. After the movie I cried because the great Heath Ledger died before the movie came out. He nailed the psychopathic, funny, and evil joker! With realistic effects, amazing cinematography, and perfect actors, I am obliged to give this a 10 out of 10!",1
"For everybody about to watch the movie for the first time:DO NOT WATCH IT WITH SUBTITILES!This ruins the ending and doesn't distract the audience member from an important point in the movie. I will not say in this message because I don't like spoilers.For people showing other people Fight Club for the first time: same. Don't turn on the subtitles because of the voice-overs. TRUST ME! It ruins the ending if you turn on the subtitles.This movie is excellent otherwise. Very psychological and deep. I had to watch it the second time to get all the subtle stuff, but besides that, it was a fantastic movie.",1
"Norton is one of my favorite actors. A brilliantly twisted thriller that makes your mind go in circles. It has psychological elements that make you go...huh? at first. So this is the type of movie you would have to watch several times in order to completely comprehend Edward Norton's character...and the reason behind Tyler Durden, his ""alter ego"" who comes to life if you will. The whole time Norton is mutilating himself, instead of Brad Pitt because Pitt(Tyler) is actually Norton. See...that's the part where you get confused about at first, but then you begin to understand is the film goes on. Just watch it a couple times, and you'll understand the plot. It's not just about guys beating the crap out of each other, there's so much more to it. It's a movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat. A must watch!",1
"At the beginning of the article, we use the technique of flashback and uninterrupted narration to clip the real world and the unreal world vividly and excellently, so that when your thinking stops at the first level, the camera has turned to the next level! The details flashed many times are narrated in place, which is the guiding line of the whole film. Focusing on the details, you can realize how brilliant the lens and clips are for the story! The content is beyond imagination, the plot is compact, the editing is brilliant, the story sequence is very logical, the narrative structure of the head and tail echo is enough to illustrate master Nolan's imagination.",1
Hands down one of my favorite films. It's rare that a movie can be even better the second time you watch it. This is one of them.,1
"Where did it all go wrong? Unfortunately all the hype turned out to be exactly that. Just hype. This is a mediocre and highly repetitive film, perhaps marginally better than average action movie. It certainly is a major improvement over the recent mess that was The Hulk, but that's not saying much. Then again, even The Hulk managed a little better in the character department for its first third, before devolving into mindless dross.They seem to have forgotten the things that made the first of the new Christian Bale Batman movies a success (In more than just box office). Dark Knight is a bloated misshapen mess of a film, with little coherent structure. From it's rather lacklustre opening to it's weak finale, we are just treated to a variety of scenes that just seem to have been lumped together._At 152 minutes, someone needed to seriously take the editing scissors to the negative. Then again, if the fat had been trimmed from this film, there wouldn't be much left. The first film worked, because we had different locations, an interesting back story, and some genuine character moments, that all came together to make the 'action' parts enjoyable. Because they had a reason for being, and we became invested in what happened to the characters.Dark Knight is simply a collection of action scenes, and 'Joker' scenes for the sake of it. Heath Ledger is serviceable as the Joker, but it's by no means an Oscar worthy performance. Jack Nicholson at least had a certain level of theatricality to make the character work, in Burton's Batman. Though in Heath Ledger's defence, he had very little to work with, character-wise. I think he did the best he could with it, despite lots of pointless 'Joker-giggling' and 'oh, look, I'm insane' expressions. There are virtually no meaningful character moments in the film, no real structure to the story, and so there is no emotional involvement in the action. The fight scenes seemed to lack any genuine sense of threat or risk, because it never felt like Batman was ever in danger. In the previous film, he was fighting people of equal training and skill, so you felt he was having to struggle to defeat his enemy. In Dark Knight, he's simply going through the motions. And any genuine threat in the violence is shied away from. Don't believe the other reviews. There's plenty of 'action' in this film, but not a lot of 'violence' as such. Which isn't always a good thing. It may keep it child-friendly (in a way) for the most part, but leaves us with no real sense of consequence or risk.In terms of setting, this time around they decided to film mostly on real city locations. The idea being, that this will make the atmosphere more realistic. Unfortunately this works against it. The ever so slight fantasy feel of Gotham in the first film, helps us as the viewer, to dwell in their reality and accept the fantastical parts. By bringing this new film more into the world of everyday reality, the more outlandish elements become less believable than they might have otherwise been, thereby resulting in a detachment from events, rather than drawing us in.Morgan Freeman is poorly used, with little to get his teeth into. While perhaps he did not have a large part in the previous film either, he was at least imbued with some sense of personality and a genuine feeling of necessity to the plot. Michael Caine fairs a little better, and is one of the few characters to maintain a reasonable level of personality and purpose, that is on a par with his character in Batman Begins.As for the Harvey Dent character, Aaron Eckhart is simply adequate, but apart from his general role as the District Attorney, his evolution into the 'Two Face' villain feels utterly superfluous and tacked-on for the sake of cramming in another temporary antagonist. Though admittedly, he has stunningly well executed CGI enhanced make-up. (unfortunately the un-shrivelled eye ruins the effect, since it simply would not have likely survived the wounds, and even if it had, would dry up and wither, without its surrounding tissue, eyelids and moisture.) He is supposed to be some sort of example about how evil can change and affect even the best of people, but it all feels clumsily executed and poorly resolved.So what's good? Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes, brings her character some much needed depth. She's a more mature actress, both in style and looks, than Katie Holmes was (As the same character in the previous film). She also has a rather sad and tired appearance, which keeps her from looking like the typical overly-pretty female love-interest. She felt like a character that you could imagine he had grown up with and loved for herself, rather than simply an attractive face.To be honest, that's about the best that can be said, in comparison to the previous film. And in it's own right, it is a movie that can best be described as an enjoyable distraction, with virtually nothing to remember once you walk out._Sadly, this is very much another forgettable summer blockbuster. What makes it so disappointing is not that it is actually that bad, but simply that it should have been so much better, and certainly does not live up to the hype.",1
Very Nice movie. I really enjoy that movie. And really,1
"If you judge this by its title and think it's just about fighting then you're wrong, this is so much more. It's a complex and intelligent psychological thriller with a brilliant twist and a great soundtrack. It just keeps getting better and better as the film moves on. This is easily one of the best films, if not the best film I've ever seen in my life. I'm sure enough people have gone into the plot so I won't need to do that, but it's definitely an exciting and thrilling experience as well as making a big impact and goes beyond where most films go. it was on my mind all day the day after I watched it. Whatever you do, watch this film.",1
This movie will forever be my all time favorite! Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed.. but it was also released on my birthday! Best movie ever!,1
"This film is very far-fetched and really you have to sit through it all without going to the restroom. As you have to get it all. In order for the film to make sense to you.Leonardo DiCaprio is Dom Cobb, a man who lost his wife, and trying to get back to his kids. He is a thief and a so-called dream expert. In leading a team, in hopes of extraditing information from the minds, to get attention from his so-called victims. Plus much more, on a personal level.But his latest dream is one that is very personal as he is unable to get back to his children, due to his wife's death. Plus, the reason it's called ""Inception"" is to planting an idea in the mind of his nemeses.It is how you come back to reality. While trying to figure out if reality is true or not. That is what Dom has to find out.DiCaprio is lead with a great supporting cast, Joseph Gordon Levitt as the pointman and DiCaprio's right-hand man and sometime comic relief; Ken Watanabe as the man who employs DiCaprio; Ellen Page is the graduate student, who leads the design of the dreams. Marion Cotillard as his ""late"" wife or so DiCaprio thinks! It is confusing and the plot at times doesn't make any sense. But the special effects are something. Christopher Nolan could well be on his way to being a Scorses, Coppola, Stone. But needs a few more hits under his belt to do so.",1
"Rarely does a film manage to mix a great plot and characters with great special effects. This is one of those films. Nolan outdid himself here. This is definitely one of my all time favourite films. Every time I watch this I find something else to be amazed at. Whether it be the characters, the plot, the music, the epic scenes, the well explained and well made scenes, the camera work, or anything else, it's just fantastic.First thing to note would be Christopher Nolan's writing. I knew exactly what was going on all of the time even though the concept or idea was sometimes hard to grasp. He explained everything through character interaction perfectly. Everything entwined together and made sense. The characters each had different, important roles. True, they may not all have been unique and we may know little background on most of them, but I believe that was necessary to the film's length and added a sense of freshness.Then there's also Christopher Nolan's directing. He hasn't topped this. Alright, maybe the Dark Knight trilogy tops it, but it's still excellent. Everything looks and feels real. And the camera work and angles just add to this at the right moments. A good example is the scene where Cobb shows Ariadne the dreamworld for the first time. The directing makes this feel huge and the angles add to this feeling.The acting in the films is great. The characters, honestly, don't really have much to work with. From the script, we can't really tell what the characters are like or anything. The only thing, I believe, that stops them from being two dimensional is the acting. We've have a background for Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and bits of background for Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) and Saito (Ken Watanabe), but basically nothing for Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), which makes the acting for them seem brilliant.Finally, one of my favourite things about the movie is the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer is my favourite composer, scraping past John Williams. He makes the best of music. What he composed for Inception was very special, though. The soundtrack for this film is just amazing in my opinion. Yes, the tracks may seem very similar, but each one is still great, especially 'Time' and 'Dream is Collapsing'.So this is a near perfect film for me. Very different from any film I've seen before. I think the concept is very well done. This film definitely deserves to be #13 on IMDb's Top 250.",1
"Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.",1
"I saw this completely for the first time since I saw it at the theater 4 years ago (I don't know HOW I COULD'VE LIVED THIS LONG WITHOUT SEEING THIS MASTERPIECEEE!!!!), and I hadn't realized how COMPLETELY AWESOME this film is! I absolutely loved it!!The story follows Batman where we left him at the end of ''Batman Begins'' (released in 2005), trying to still cope with the death of his parents and having to face his most infamous enemy: The Joker. The story here is CENTRAL to the movie and is EVERYWHERE. But it is also very emotional, epic and, sometimes, it even has some deeper, philosophical meaning to it.Even though BB was pretty dark and totally different from past Bat movies, this one goes even DARKERR!!! It makes the villains a lot more realistic that Ra's in BB, which was basically a ninja. Here, The Joker is just an ordinary crazy guy, who (like Alfred quotes at some point in the movie) ''just wants to watch the world burn.'' The acting here is what sells the movie, in my opinion. I mean, Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, and of course Heath Ledger as Joker, all deserve special mentions, as they all deliver AWESOME ROLES! I mean, seriously, The Joker is so scary and disturbing in this, but at the same time we know why he does this, as Nolan delves deeply in both the psychology of Joker and Batman. Ledger delivers the performance of his career in this (R.I.P, Heath! You WILL BE MISSEDD!! :'(), he's absolutely BRILLIANT, as is the rest of the cast (including Bale as Batman, whose only gripe I have with his acting is the stupid voice he makes when he puts on the suit. It's so cartoonish and distracting >_<!), but Ledger definitely steals the show.Special effects and editing are really good here, with the former is even more satisfactorily showcased if you watch the film on Bluray, which makes everything look absolutely GORGEOUS!! Every airborne shot in this is epic.Also, the music is also something which enhances the experience in a truly remarkable way. The main theme here is so awesome and overall the music in this (composed by known composer Hans Zimmer) just makes the movie all the more exciting and emotional when it needs to be.Overall, this movie is a must-see for any Bat-fan, superhero movie or comic book fan out there. The acting, story, music, etc... everything is just so perfectly balanced to create an even better and ''epicker'' (I know I've said the word ''epic'' in pretty much every paragraph in this review, but cut me some slack, I love this movie!! xDDD) film than it's already superb predecessor.",1
"The Dark Knight is simply an amazing cinematic achievement. Everything about this movie is at the peak level of brilliance. First off, the cast is impeccable; everyone from Christian Bale to Eric Roberts plays their part to perfection. And I can't forget the absolutely incredible performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger has taken an iconic villain and given it a new, enthralling twist. The Joker and Batman play off each other so well, unlike any other hero and villain I've ever seen in any movie.Most importantly is the story. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan take some of the most outrageous characters ever created and puts them into a realistic world where maniacal clowns, winged vigilantes, and super-technology like the Bat-Pod can exist without any reservation.The Dark Knight is by far the best film of the year, and one of the most outstanding movies of the decade. Christopher Nolan should receive all the gracious credit in the world for making a masterpiece of a movie. He did what Tim Burton, Joel Schumacher, and even himself in making Batman Begins, could not do: Make the Dark Knight be considered a great movie first, and a Batman and comic-book movie second.",1
"Definitely a movie to watch several times. Good script, great cast and one hell of a good time.Remember snaks and drinks :D",1
"I never wrote a review before, but I couldn't resist myself after watching this movie, no doubt one of the best movie I have watched.I Had this movie with me from a long time, but never was interested to watch it. and then couple of times tried to watch it but every time it was less than 30 Min. and then one of my frnd told me about this movie he saw and I was so impressed with the story and screenplay. on the same night I watched it and its amazing.everyone who wants to be thrilled or amazed pls watch this movie. I would not like to discuss the story because that ruins your pleasure of watching this movie. but I can assure you that watching this movie will amaze you.",1
"Well how i can start, before watching the movie for the first time i told myself that i would be fare and judge the movie far from the fact that it is ranked no.1 on IMDb , so here it is I opened it and couldn't move away from the screen for 142 minutes, it is not just any movie it is honestly a piece of art ! The movie talks about friendship, love , crime , passion, corruption but the most important of all is HOPE, ""hope is a dangerous thing"" that is the fact we should all know, but how many of us can face the danger? Which amazed me more in the movie that it gave us the fact that some people are dead even if they look alive, because if we don't live as we want we are already dead people! Yes it is the best movie I've ever watched, and I wish to see other masterpieces from Darabont in the near future.",1
"Yet I could not watch the movie , but it seems to me the story pleases me a lot. I'll do with the maximum attention. I hope not disappoint me this production.I was Recommended As such hope and what is in the agreement with the opinion of my colleague. Never had listen talk in "" The Shawshank Redemption of (1994 ) "" but I liked In this prefecture.I am pretty addicted to series and recommend The Vampire Diaries , I found this fabulous series . Watch and not go wrong.",1
Genius. Perfect. Great Story. Great Actors. One of my favourite movies. Too bad that nowadays they'll never make a movie as half as good as this,1
"Amazing. Phenomenal. History making. Awe inspiring. These are some of the clichés that came to mind after seeing DARK KNIGHT. What's not a cliché is Christopher Nolan's brilliant and intricate script, beautifully crafted, all at once disturbing, funny, frightening, thought provoking and exciting.From start to finish you know you are watching quality. All involved are working to make the best film possible. The opening scene reminded me of a 1970's cop film. Like SERPICO, it has a distinct texture of grittiness and elegance. It's surprising to me how much more exciting it is to watch action sequences that are rooted in real world physics. When Batman gets punched or shot, he feels it, and so do we.The acting is excellent across the board, but two of my favorite performances were Heath Ledger's unnerving Joker; I haven't been that afraid for the other characters since Jet Li in LETHAL WEAPON 4, and Gary Oldman as the mere mortal everyman, Police Commissioner Gordon mustering every ounce of his courage to fight evil, insurmountable forces much bigger than he. The Joker is definitely the driving force of the film, with everyone having to react against his next move, and the film skillfully creates a horrible anxiety, a lot of which comes from watching the characters' resolve, wither and die when attacked by one of The Joker's hypnotic psychological barrages. Even Christian Bale's formidably played Batman, has a difficult time maintaining his composure while facing The Joker. You can see it in his eyes.A great casting twist was Eric Roberts as Gotham's mob boss Salvatore Maroni. They could have gone the route of the quintessential grease ball Italian. Instead they did something more akin to John Gotti, a smirking, unflappable, aging bad boy in an impeccable, designer suit who could almost pass for Arian. Roberts provides yet another touch of realism which adds to the film's classiness.A third character of the film is the population of Gotham itself. Too often in these films we watch the lead actors rattle on about ""saving the population"" with no real attachment with the people they are responsible for. Not so in DARK KNIGHT. The world is so rich and believable and the characters so 3 dimensional that as an audience member, you're likely to feel that you too are a citizen of Gotham, and all you'll want to do is get out of town.",1
"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",1
"Inception has kinda stolen it's plot (i'm sorry to say) from the Cronenberg movie ""eXistenZ"". Major difference is that in Inception they travel in dreams and not inside games. Both movies carry in their story some of the same references to certain philosophers. Also, like in eXistenZ, it is not clear but strongly suggested, that in the end of the movie our protagonist is not yet back in the real world. Besides that it has the same ""oh no I kinda killed my wife"" plot as in Memento and The Prestige (the same somewhat goes for The Dark Knight - referring to Two-face, but that's OK because it's part of the original Batman story). Makes you wonder if Nolan has some issues here or if he's just too much of a fan of his own idea. Hence it is NOT a one-of-a-kind idea which everyone seems to think! Besides that it's a really good movie! Good acting and extremely nice visuals. Thumbs up to Nolan - but give us something original the next time please. We all know you are capable Nolan! ;)",1
"This is a good film, but it's not the masterpiece everyone believes it is.",1
"I first saw this film in America, before it aired in the UK, after having briefly read a review in an American magazine while waiting in the car. I came in knowing that it was something about dreams, and entering other people's dream. Oh, there was DiCaprio - this was before my love affair with his acting started - who I'd enjoyed a lot in Blood Diamond and less in Titanic. But, in any case, I loved this film. Absolutely loved it.I found DiCaprio's character compelling and well-acted, I found the rest of the cast to be strong and watchable, I found the story understandable (and far less confusing that some people seem to think it is, though I don't see this as a disadvantage). All in all, very much worth watching as a film.",1
"It's one of the best movie I had watch including Hollywood and Bollywood... after first time watching this movie dub version I became quite confused as I haven't watched the whole thing from the start to finish as I was waiting it on a cable channel......
After sometime later when I watch it again on my newly brought smartphone,as I watched it in English version and I realized that in Hindi dub that the meaning is quite different from the original meaning and quite silly.......The concept of this movie is fresh as there is nothing like it before in movie world, though there are novels that has similar concept,but this the first movie the concentrate entirely on the concept of dream world..... it's like matrix movie series where concept of virtual reality concept step foot in the movie world.
This movie show that the potential of human brain,if it is possible to create a device that can allow us to enter our or other dream world there will be limitless possibilities for human to grow in knowledge...",1
"Epic if you can keep up with it! I had doubts about it because of all the hype. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to a movie that has been hyped up only to come away disappointed. But this really deserved all the hype it got. I really do think it's Nolan's best movie since Memento. I mean The Dark Knight was good(another movie that got too much hype in my opinion.) But to me this is 10 times better. I was most impressed with the story and writing. There's so much going on which in most cases is bad but not in this. Acting wise I would have to say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page gave the best performances, but the other cast is good as well. Until this I disliked Marion Cotillard mostly because she was in Public Enemies which I didn't care for in the least bit but she's great in this. But to me Inception may be the best movie of the year so far! I can't wait to see what Nolan will do next.",1

"It's a one of the best movie I have seen , Here is so many symbolic link in every detail and nothing is from it needless populist ...
Generally everythingg begining comparing extremely different edges like a : ""bad"" and ""good"", ""evil"" and ""kind"", ""cry"" and ""smile"" ""crowd"" and ""society""... And simply sowing the fact that there is only one step between them and they can be mix in easily or be same too "" diffusion boundary"".
The second is that It's very clearly shown Batman's super power, his firm character and steadfastness of soul, actually we see that Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne has smae counterweight on libra they both love Rachel but only Bruce can endure and stay smae principles fateful after Rachel's death that is Batman's super power.
And third, the super hero is only fruit of society where he/she lives and that was brilliantly shown in the "" ferry scene "" actually that was moment when should been decided who was Ghotems hero Joker or Batman and it ended up in favor of Batman .
Actually it is a really small amount of thought I can express beyond this is million details in a thoughtful context . Cast and playing ? the style of shooting? without excess musice witch creates an idyllic environment for express emotions, that is everything that make this movie masterpiece..

"I'm sure I'll revisit Inception, sooner rather than later. Christopher Nolan's film has its ambitions, oh sure to be sure. But when one looks at what he is really trying to accomplish here, it's to tell a story and with verve, originality (or at least taking solid cinematic forms and archetypes and using them originally), and a point of view that is astonishing. I still have scenes and images, performances and moments, shots and details of the plot (and a kick-ass final shot especially) rolling around in my head, and I don't want them to go away. Even things about the film that I should find flawed, such as a little clunky exposition and some edits that go by lightning fast work because of what does count: we care about what happens to these characters, or at least Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), and whether or not they'll achieve this ""mission"" of putting an idea in someone's head.To explain all of the finer mechanics of the plot... just go to wikipedia, or IMDb's plot synopsis. I'll just say for here that the film takes its own creation of science-fiction variety seriously. And seriously enough to take jaded moviegoers of the cineplex variety along for the ride. It's kind of like a heist plot, though not really, in that ""idea"" thieves- people who use dreams, shared via inter-connecting tubes (like the Matrix only more complex)- are recruited by Saito (Ken Watanabe), a big businessman of some sort to plant an idea in someone's head, or 'inception', which has not been done except for once when Cobb did it to a certain someone (he won't mention why, for a big reveal in the last act, though not a twist). That's really what you need to know - that and Ariadne (Ellen Page) will act as the audience in a sense to keep exposition going... sometimes too much on a first viewing.And yet, for all of the characters standing around explaining things, which should be (and is) a big no-no in movies (SHOW don't TELL, remember), it can work here because a) it is such a complex concept, considering all of the calculations of time, as well as the 'rules' of sort, which are laid out so well that nothing can be too confusing for anyone, even if one wanted to, and b) the acting is so good in doing it. There is genuine emotion as well, which is something that some of the so-so or negative reviews find is lacking here (there are a handful out there if you'd believe it Nolan-heads). I say simply that if you don't find emotion during those scenes between DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard, who used such a one-dimensional character to her total advantage here and steals all of her scenes with a beautiful face and haunting delivery- then, well, maybe you got the wrong movie.Sure, there's lots of pyrotechnics and big gun battles, but they work for the sake of this story and the circumstances too. I was worried they wouldn't, that things might be too rigid in the sense of it being dreams, why are there all of these guns and violence and whatnot. But, for me, it ended up making much more sense, in a non-sensible ""Hollywood Movie"" way, watching it unfold within the rules. It is much more sci- fi-thriller than a David Lynch surrealist trip anyhow, and on Nolan's terms he bases his own sense of lucid dream logic. I also really liked how the stakes were so high for the characters in dreams: if you die in a dream, for example, what if you don't wake up, but end up in a kind of dream limbo, or something bizarre like that? How do these levels affect you if you're injured or dying? This is not as simplified as in the Matrix, albeit with less 'tells' than showing it happen. Aw hell, who cares? This is creative summer entertainment on one hand, and a brainy-emotionally-psychologically engaging story with a melancholy core. When it gets thrilling, it thrills (hallway fight, anyone), and when it needs to move, it does so, or when it needs to provide little ""ooh"" visual wonders like Joseph Gordon Levitt floating along and doing his part in the time-frame, Nolan comes up with wonders there too. It shouldn't require a repeat viewing, yet I do want to go back again, not to have things re-explained to me, which is unnecessary, but to revisit the characters, the multi-layered (literally) story structure, and the intensity of the direction. It's a helluva trip through the ""architecture of the mind"", and a very fine return to form to the 'early' sort of mind-f***er movies Nolan's made in the past.",1
"Violence, sex, and chaos are just a few reasons why this film is my favorite. I'm a chick; and when it is movie night with the girls this is our #1 film to watch. We can even quote it from Bob with bitch tits to Marla and her quirky view point on Narrator/Tyler. The special effects are outstanding. The dialogue absolutely gorgeously grotesque in all of its 90's splendor. The character development is as complex as the storyboard. Book turned into a movie without leaving the entire story at the wayside. Read the book and and watch the movie. If you want a good movie for a date night but don't know what to pick then this just might work in your favor.",1
"Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight..-- Jonathan Nolan, The Dark Knight",1
"I've seen all Christopher Nolan's movies and I must say that I'm quite a fan of his job, however, this movie is beyond everything I've seen not just in Nolan's work, but in the entire decade. Nolan loves to play with timing. Memento (his second long-cut) is the perfect example of this. He also like a lot to create this suspense feeling to the viewer, this feeling that you don't know why but you know something great is about to happen, you don't know when, or what is it, but you just know. It's all in the sound, that's the way he manage to make you get that sensation. Inception is just the combination of Nolan's best tricks, the perfect combination. It takes you to a whole new world in a movie, one that you've never imagined. The best movie of the year without doubts! I think that this will get the nomination for best movie as well as Nolan the nomination for best achievement in direction. Christopher Nolan is on his way to get into the pages of cinematographic history as one of the big names as a director and also as writer.",1
"Marla is symbolic for - depression Cornelius (or whatever his namne is) is symbolic for - normal And Tyler Durden is symbolic for - high mood A person with ""bipolar disorder"" have all these three personalitys. They can be depressed, normal and extreme self confident about themselves. They don't care about small things and have grand ideas when they are in a high mood (Tyler durden) When the buildings fall down in the end of the movie it's symbolic for what the disease has done to him, and he will fall down into a low mood. He is standing there and holding hands with Marla which stands for depression.I'm almost positive that the film is symbolic for something like this",1
"Whenever I see a prison or even think about it, the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. Maybe it's because I have watched this masterpiece so many times that it's actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. I just cannot explain how well this film is made. The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact that it is based upon ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, they shine just like a diamond, stupendous performances by them. I still can't believe that it never got any major accolade and didn't even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which can't be missed.",1

"The Dark Knight was certainly worth the wait. After the humongous success of Begins I had high expectations for this movie mainly cause I am a hardcore batman fan from the comics and before I saw TDK I felt that only begins made an effort to be THE batman movie.First and foremost Heath Ledger's performance is to be highly commended. Although his career was short lived His spirit is seen in this movie through an incredible performance that not only captures your attention every time the joker comes on screen but also scares the crap out of you. This role is enough to put Ledger in the elite level of even Marlon Brando. THis particular joker will go on to become an iconic character in movie history. You can see the sadistic appeal that the Joker reflects and his portrayal is nothing short of genius.Of Christian Bale also made an amazing impact .I would have to say that he fits perfectly into the shoes of Bruce Wayne and although the spotlight is stolen by the joker , Bale was still as brilliant as ever. Michael Caine on the other hand was downright fantastic. Words cannot express the kind of character that he portrayed. Aaron Eckart I would say although made a superb portrayal to the character of Harvey Dent/Two face I still feel he only gave 99% justice to the role. Morgan Freeman ,Gary Oldman also took their parts and came out great.One very unique aspect that makes this film stand out from not only the rest of the batman franchise but also the rest of the superhero universe is that the story is nothing short of phenomenal .I have garnered a new respect for Christopher Nolan because not only did he fit elements of crime,corruption and public issues into a SUPERHERO film in a way where the chemistry between them worked but also he took the superhero genre and crafted a mature yet excellent story that not only would appeal to the fans but also to the masses. If you so as much find the story a little dragging enjoy the superb bat pod in action in what I can only say would be one of the most inventive chase scenes I have seen in any movie.In the end I did feel maybe an inch of disappointment because the comic book element was missing in this film but that inch faded away in a matter of seconds replaced by what I can only say is'THE GODFATHER OF SUPERHERO FILMS'",1
"The experience of a hot-shot banker named Andrew Dufresne played by Tim Robbins. After being sentenced to 2 life terms for the killing of his wife and her lover, Andy then finds himself to be an inmate at the Shawshank prison. For a crime, he swears he didn't commit. The movie is centered around Andy's journey as an inmate in the prison, the brutal beatings and harassments, and changes he experiences. Where Andy meets another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman, mistakenly picks him as the new prisoner that will most likely crack under the pressures of prison. After the beating and killing of one of the new inmates (fishes) Andy still does not break. Reds ability to obtain wanted objects helps establish a friendship between him and Red. This friendship leads to many prison adventures and later events help him and he gains respect from his friends, staff, and the warden.Motifs displayed in the film are Corruption and crime. The idea of the prison should be the rehabilitation of men. However, instead the prison is focuses and praises corruption, greed, and money laundering. Andy's quick willingness to launder money for the Warden Norton played by Bob Gunton showed his survival skills and need to protect himself. The editors use of voice-overs and flash backs sets the scenes for viewers allowing them to be able to see the events of the prison.My thematic ideas of the film are Isolation and imprisonment, which seems to be a large focus of the film. The bars, strict schedules, horrible guards are just some of the reason for isolation. The film shows a lot of people taking advantage of the system for their own gain, from Red, who smuggles anything into the prison. All the way to the Warden, who benefits from forced prison labor and money laundering. However, the power of hope is Andy's main driver throughout his experience in prison. Andy attempts to maintain his self-worth and idea of getting out one day. Tunneling his way through the concrete cell wall. Hope is all that Andy has left.",1
"I first saw this movie in 2007 and have since seen it countless times as well as again in theaters in 2009 for some special 10th anniversary small showing in theaters. i had heard bits and pieces about it through the years and i always got the vibe that it was some surface level pretty boy movie with a little edge. how more wrong could i be, this movie has lots of bizarre scenes and a totally unique way of story telling, and some people get lost before the movie really begins to make sense. if you were to stop halfway through the movie you wouldn't have any idea how it all ends. i do feel however that this is most appealing to younger men who have yet to develop a strong personality as i was when i first watched it. i am unsure on how much my age at the time tied in with my obsession with this movie for months after i watched it. its dark and bound for certain people not to enjoy it based on all its uniqueness but i can honestly say there are probably less than 15 movies I would give all 10 star reviews on and this is one. in my opinion for a movie to get 10 starts it must have told a perfect story in all parts beginning to end and not leave me feeling that they could have done anything better for the story they are trying to tell and this movie for me has it all.",1
"Devin Faraci of CHUD.com claimed that ""Inception"" was everything director Christopher Nolan had been building up to in his film-making career. I disagree; this was everything he has been building to with his film-watching career. That's not a knock, either.Nolan is cutting himself short in interviews when he says he was influenced by ""The Matrix"", but maybe he's using that to address the mainstream audience, since that's what they'll likely accuse him of stealing from. However, the rest of us know better (especially since ""The Matrix itself owes its genesis to many other films before it, as most great films do.) Despite being, at it's most basic, a high-concept heist film, it doesn't rely on, nor does it emphasize its set piece(s), the big robbery, or in this case, the big. . . placement?Instead, this film pays off through the emotions of the characters, which is awesome because it makes the set pieces seem like small, but visually stunning discoveries. Like David Fincher's ""The Game"", the movie makes effort to remind you that, as grand as the action and adventure can and will become, this all still happens in the heads of ""real"" people, all dealing with their own issues which, interestingly enough, can effect the adventure in ways that could help or hurt their goal. If I can find one fault in this, I wish they concentrated on more than just the lead, DiCaprio's, character when it came to emotions because he's honestly washed out in that department, and for good reason. When his tragic past is revealed, it is easily the most effective piece of the puzzle thanks in no small part to Marion Coutilard, whom I've never even heard speak English until this film. But too bad the film had to wear that piece out until it barely fit.You see, as a high concept film, the set-up requires heavy, HEAVY exposition. It takes up the majority of the first hour and, although I didn't feel it, I saw people walking out of the theater by the mid- point. Even the aforementioned emotional piece is delivered in exposition. This would've been fine since you have to know the game before you play, but the exposition extends into the third act when DiCaprio's character has to face his demons, and goes on to the point of repeating a flashback from before which was unnecessary. This is the problem when one character gets all of the emotional development.This leads me up to my main strike against this film: it shouldn't have been a film. Not that this gratuitous level of ""tell, don't show"" would be more acceptable in another medium, but it, like all of Nolan's stories, would be easier to digest in comic form. This way, you get the genius of Nolan's visuals and are able to turn back the pages to review pieces you may have overlooked instead of restarting the whole damn film. Going back to what I said about the non-emphasis on set pieces, I don't expect viewers to sludge through the explanation during a second viewing just to get to the toned down but entertaining action. It's not enough, for me at least because it's hard for me to rewatch a film a re- experience the same emotional jolt as the first time, which saddens me because their is some superb film-making that I'd like to re-explore just for learning's sake.So, overall, see it. Support original (yes, despite the influences) material from great directors. I don't want to see Nolan reduced to superhero franchise films, regardless of how good they've been. The next Batman/Superman film will inevitably be made (or rebooted) with or without Nolan, so it's incredibly important that he gets a chance to stretch his legs and make something more individual and, ultimately, most resonant. And who knows, maybe with those future successes, he can do a franchise you enjoy right instead of, I don't know, M. Night Shyamalan.",1
I really liked this movie. The thing i enjoyed most is how we seen the joker more than batman. The joker played by Heath ledger was excellent. HE did a magnificent job playing his part. The joker who int the original cartoon was a crazy but very smart villain. I believe this is going to be the best someone has ever and will ever play the joker. The overall movie was great. I mean a lot of the past batman movies were a whole bunch of action and not to much thinking. Batman is known for his detective type mind and figuring out things. This movie bought that to us. A lot of times i thought one thing was going to happen and something completely different happened. Thas what i like most is the being so unpredictable.,1

"After a night's reflection (and much discussion) I reward Christopher Nolan's masterpiece ""Inception"" a perfect rating, one of only a handful of movies I've ever given that rating to. The man who blew me away with ""Memento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and ""The Dark Knight"" has easily solidified himself as the greatest filmmaker of the last decade in my opinion. How good is ""Inception?"" It's already in my top 10 movies of all time. It might even be top 5. Time will tell if it holds up as well on repeat viewings, but I was blown away many times in the theater in ways I haven't felt since I saw the original Matrix. This film features special effects that you seriously have to see to believe. It has a superbly crafted plot, complicated enough to demand the viewer's full attention but presented in a way that doesn't cheat or degenerate into nonsense. Much like the plot itself, there are many layers to the film that manages to combine so many well known genres, rolling it all together into one of the most unique experiences I've had. It is almost like experiencing two or three amazing movies at once. It's easy to tell how much work and dedication went into the making of this film. Christopher Nolan has a lot on his mind and it's rare to find a movie that simultaneously pulls off being such an entertaining summer blockbuster while existing as a work of psychologically challenging art. A perfect cast of characters are paired with an amazing score by Hans Zimmer, and ""Inception"" flies through it's extended running time by taking the intensity meter up to 11 and leaving it there for over half of its runtime. The viewer barely has a chance to catch their breath while taking in all the twists, turns, and to borrow a phrase from Neo, ""Whoa"" moments. It is easily the best film to come out since The Dark Knight. You have simply never seen something quite like this before.Christopher Nolan has gained so much respect by demanding attention to detail from his audience, never insulting them, but always staying a few steps ahead. It's rare for a film to live up to the hype (which I'm no doubt adding to with this review) but trust me when I say this is the kind of movie that makes a great barometer for other critics. To put it bluntly, I can't trust a movie review from someone that can't enjoy this movie on some level.As this thrill ride of a film was coming to a close, and the theater audience was reacting to the final frame, I confirmed to myself what I had thought several times during the film: ""Inception"" is something special.",1
"I wonder why DiCaprio never received an Oscar... It is a good movie, time consuming one too, but to actually have it on the top 20 list is absurd, the story had a great cast but the length of the scenes sometimes were extremely long and pointless it seemed as if they were trying to fill in the minutes. Quiet sad, because it was a good one. If you heard about it and decided to watch it do so. For those who are more into hardcore psychology movies and science fiction this won't top your list but will be part of it, definitely. As always the ending wasn't the greatest and elongated for no particular reason. As for the supporting cast they were all syn chronic and on the same page.",1
"This movie works in a many ways. There is a weird love story, weird characters and also weird humour. All the things that i love! I can't think better actors to this movie. All of them bring some good darkness with a good sense of humour. I have to say that this movie can't be perfect. It is all the bad and good things that made this movie what it is. It is Fight Club. Movie about everything and judging everything. After this movie you can see the world from different angle. Movie which you have to see to understand all the hype and good things about it. Movie that you will love or hate. I will guarantee that it is something that you have never seen before.",1

"Christopher Nolan returns with Inception, the definitive summer blockbuster of the year that stands heads and shoulders above it's competition consisting of adaptations, remakes and sequels full of mindless action. With this highly intellectual film, he has once again challenged the average movie-goer by starting off with a mind-bogging and profound concept of dreams and reality, with a spectacular heist going under way, while we follow the emotional journey of the protagonist. Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb, who is a skilled thief in the art of Extraction; stealing the darkest secrets of a person through his or her subconsciousness, or in other words, dreams. After becoming a fugitive, he is offered a chance back into his old life, but only if he can perform what is known to be impossible; the act of planting an idea into someone's mind, known as Inception. Cobb assembles a team as they prepare for a mission into the mind so dangerous that may cost them the ability to distinguish dreams from reality forever. DiCaprio is flawless here. As Cobb, he sparks off the presence of a true expert in his field, but as the story digs deeper into him we see a conflicted man haunted by his own obsessions. Leo's star-studded co- stars threatened to steal the show, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy providing comic relief in an intriguing rivalry, and Ellen Page as the enthusiastic student who is introduced to dream sharing for the first time. All the tricks and trademarks of Nolan that we have come to know and love are evident here, from the first scene that teases us of what's to come, to that last scene that will have us re-examine ourselves, and on these message boards, possibly years of debate. Here, Nolan combines some of the greatest aspects of his past films; from the puzzle-solving quest in Memento to the brilliantly thought out heist plans and action sequences in the Batman movies, while he masterfully unfolds the secrets of Cobb one layer at a time. Visually he succeeds in capturing the feel of dreams with scene cuts, incoherent objects and physics-defying feats. However, with Nolan being a technical film director more fond of practical methods, it leaves one thinking if this film could have been more visually spectacular had there been more use of CGI of the highest standards. On top of being one of the few original films out there with a bold and exciting concept, Inception's greatest triumph comes in it's ability to tease the audience with more questions raised than answers given throughout the film. Even if Nolan himself denies it, there is no doubt that Inception is toying with it's audience, hinting at different takes and theories to the film throughout. But that is exactly why we will love this movie, for it sets us uncontrollably debating over the ambiguities and paradoxes that perhaps will never have a definitive answer, and question ourselves on the true meaning of the film. In an era where the typical summer action film so often contains so little depth, this is probably exactly what we need.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption was my favourite movie for many years, but it was beaten after i watched the good the bad and the ugly; but that doesn't change anything a felt about this movie and how brilliant it really is. This movie has the best character development in movie history! It shows the way prison life has on people; especially those who have been wrongly accused, the slow decent into madness and depression as the years go by. Also, theres not many movies that make you truly hate a character because of there wicked and evil acts, Warden Norton and Captain Hadley are deceptive and cruel to the inmates of the prison, and i smiled when there story came to an end. The leading Actors such as Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman display some of the finest acting in movie history, their skills make the audience feel sorry for them at emotional times in the movie and its difficult for a movie to make the audience feel that way. As for the script, it is written perfectly and is major highlight the movie, again; this is improved further because of the amazing performances from the cast. the story is a story of loss, hope... and redemption, it may seem like a normal prison movie at first, but soon enough you'll really begin to appreciate how inspirational the movie really is. As the for the climax, The Shawshank Redemption has one of the most bitter sweet endings of all time. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time, it will be remembered in the media until the end of days; this is the movie the directors of today should watch to see what cinema is all about.",1
"On the plus side the acting is very fine throughout. Scenes are nicely set up and the cinematography is generally excellent. The plot is interesting, characters well drawn, and the script reasonably intelligent. Ledger is as advertised, consistently in charge of his role and the film when on screen. He is a very fine physical actor as well as convincing in closeups. He didn't have a false note throughout, a tough achievement when playing essentially a one note character who is off the wall. Negatives: the film could be improved with 1/2 hour of excess trimmed. Some plot contrivances didn't work to forward the action, especially in the second half where plot and action dragged because scenes just wouldn't end. There is too much of stylized crashes and explosions, to the point where they lose any effect. And the plot twist is so far outside reason it just doesn't work, especially with the ridiculous CGI display. However with all that the movie is probably worth seeing, if you like blockbusters and their attendant frailties.",1
"Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time. It is a must see. The Acting by the two protagonists are spectacular. The use of Music in this movie is genius. And the camera work gives hope to any aspiring film maker. It also gives hope to the entire cinema world. 1994 what a year for movies! I end with a quote ""he dispersed like a fart in the wind.""",1
"This film is NOTHING like what the advertisments are calling it.  It is not a ""ROCKY"" for the next generation.  It is a very odd, unique, original film that may disturb viewers.  I myself have seen hundreds of films, and it takes alot to distrub me, but Fight Club did it. This film is very good, and should be seen by those who can handle it. Word to the wise though...the ending is a little hard to swallow.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is a well-crafted prison drama and another great movie to add to Frank Darabont's impressive filmography. Morgan Freeman is the standout as one of the most endearing characters in cinema history, while Tim Robbins and a host of excellent character actors fill out an outstanding ensemble cast that make you feel like you are there with them in that prison. This is an emotionally satisfying film with many memorable character moments sprinkled into an otherwise pretty standard plot. While I find it to be a little too sensitive at times, this is an excellent motion picture and a must see. It may deserve to be generally regarded as (one of) the most overrated film(s) ever made, but it is above all a wonderful, uplifting and deeply touching tale of hope and perseverance that certainly deserves to be remembered as one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story.",1
"I watched Batman Begins immediately before seeing Dark Knight, and Batman Begins was definitely more 'real' than Dark Knight, more gritty, and a more coherent, smooth screenplay. No doubt Heath Ledgers' Joker is a superb Villain - to go down in the history books as one of the best all time on the big screen, however he was misused and underused. He had a grasp on the character like no one else, yet they didn't have near the character development they should have for him, and they lost focus almost making the movie more about Harvey Dent (played with a bland performance by Aaron Eckhart) than the Joker. Bruce Wayne comes on the scene much less humble and down to earth than his character in Batman Begins, and Maggie Gyllenhaal's character was more annoying and less lovable than Katie Holmes' rendition. It felt like there was just too much money put into this that took the focus off of making the storyline tight, and instead was about how many different things can we do with the money.Cinematography was good with several picturesque shots, stunt work was spectacular, and the Joker was insane and intoxicating, however without him the movie would be sub par. It's a shame.",1
"Such a classic. Even though they are in prison and cant do much, they give a lot of good advice in life and its very enjoyable to say the least to watch their characters.The movie is a roller coaster ride of good feelings and bad.",1
"Fight Club will be prodded, studied and viewed for years. Whether its putting down the fascist ideals of conservative America, its speaking volumes about the pointless intricacies of wealth and status. Fight Club isn't about violence, its about the expunging of shallow capitalist maxims and rebirth, an epiphany of real life.Granted, the film's own preaching can be twisted and used against it, but the inherent messages one can derive from such a film will be deeper and more meaningful than your trite romance or teen-sex comedy. A gem for all who have seen it.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",1
"I couldn't tell the shock I've been watching in my life, even after watching this movie, I was interested in films with schizophrenic content, but I couldn't live the feeling that I've experienced in this film in any other film.",1
"If Avatar raised the bar high with its stupendous technical accomplishment, then Inception has set the bar even higher with its technical brilliance intertwined with a story that keeps you riveted to your seats till the end. Where Avatar missed out with its otherwise bland storyline, Inception has delivered and how! ''An idea can transform the world'' - the perfectionist Christopher Nolan's unique idea about dreams materialized into Inception and has transformed the very notion of a 'movie'. Nolan, who leaves no stone unturned in hunting out the perfect actors in his films does not make an exception here. Known for bringing out the most engrossing performances from his cast, the vintage Nolan has once again succeeded in making his actors give such effortless executions of their roles thus orchestrating into one of the most intriguing movies ever made.True to Nolan style, Inception keeps you guessing with its thrills and spins, the delicate intricacies that make perfect use of your mind and the engaging visuals that never leave even a single minute boring. One of the most original scripts written by Nolan with fantastic dialogues, the mind-boggling multi-layered film simply entices you with its breathtaking cinematography and superb special effects.You can feel yourself sharing the dreams of the extractors as Dom Cobb, the master extractor goes on stealing ideas from the human mind by sharing dreams. You can feel his emotions as his belief torments his soul and Ariadne's anxiety that his personal pain might actually bring about the downfall of their entire mission. If the movie's first half enchants you with its charm then the second half simply blows your mind. For the first half is the basic lead-up to the actual process of inception shown in the second half, which Dom Cobb takes up as a challenge which would aid him to return to his children.And there lies the multi-layered dream fantasy, a dream within a dream - something you have never seen before. And each layer is executed with such impeccability and intelligence that you cannot help taking your eye off the screen for even a single second.And to top it all Hans Zimmer's association with the movie brings out the best in every scene with his brilliant score.Over the years Leonardo Di Caprio has grown even better as an actor and his latest offering of Cobb, the corporate spy with a tortured mind might finally be enough for an Oscar breakthrough. Ellen Page as the prodigious architect, Ariadne and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cobb's team member, Arthur deliver impressive performances. Ken Watanabe's portrayal of a cunning businessman was absolutely just what the movie required. Tom Hardy as the witty forger, Eames and Cilian Murphy as the heir, Fischer Jr with hidden emotions do a commendable job. Last but not the least, Marion Cotillard was haunting and bewitching in her small role as Cobb's deceased wife, Mal who appears in his subconscious.This is by far Nolan's best offering till date. While a single viewing might not be enough to grasp the film entirely, its grandeur will simply mesmerize the audience and cover up any flaw, if it really has any. If Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight raised the bar of expectations, then Nolan has simply exceeded those expectations with Inception and makes himself an absolutely compelling candidate for the Academy Awards!",1

Starting a new life inside prison, first as a librarian then as financial assistant for the prison director, Andy goes through his conviction.But there is one secret that Andy reveals to Red that will change their lives once they're freed.",1
"It is a film that can be watched over and over again, however, it is very predictable and slightly dated...I would recommend ordering in, kicking back and enjoying the movie on a big screen TV with surround sound audio. The mood can get to be a little deep, so if you have any un-mended wounds deep within your soul, make sure to have an endless supply of tissues at hand. It is a film about beating the odds, about injustice and retribution. It isn't really a movie about payback as much as it is about looking inside oneself, seeing the good in life and the digging in of their heels when circumstances become seemingly overwhelming and impossible. The story almost follows the classic structure of the hero's journey and manages to hit every emotional nerve on the way. There is one other movie that I can think of in all of cinema history that has managed to pull that off and it is the princess bride. The princess bride is very light hearted and is nothing like The Shawshank Redemption except for the fact that it is multi faceted and emotional.",1
"I liked this movie because the performances were so good, and because the first part of the movie was just about perfect at creating an atmosphere of yuppie existential nausea. I always like Edward Norton a lot, for a change Brad Pitt gives a decent performance, and the plot is nicely twisted, but ultimately the movie is just dumb. I think that a movie like this can be more than an exercise in style only when the plot makes some sense. The plot in this movie makes no more sense than something like ""Atlas Shrugged"", so the movie is just high class junk. It's pretty hard to discuss the plot without putting in a spoiler, and since the key plot point wasn't obvious to me until shortly before it was exposed (and I had fun figuring out what was going on), I don't want to ruin it for other people. Just don't be fooled by the early part of the movie into thinking that it has anything deep to say.",1
"The Dark Knight is Chris Nolan's best work so far. It has everything you need for a sequel, the characters are evolving, the story proceeds logically, it has action, drama, voltage, funny moments. It's the best example of how a movie should be. The whole cast plays consistently well, but one trumps all. Heath Ledgers performance as the crazy and diabolical clown is with out of doubt the best representation of a villain in a movie. Whenever he leaves the screen you are waiting for his next appearance. This is how a the Joker should be and not the harmless version of 89'. So you can say the Dark Knight is a perfect Batman and almost the best film ever made.9,5 of 10 Bats",1
"The plot was incredible, interesting, script writing superb and 2 of the best actors at the time.The cinematography is brilliant, the dark humour, twists, style. Every element of this film was executed to perfection.This movie set a new standard and precedent in the industry.",1
"What Christopher Nolan did with Batman Begins was amazing enough, but to do it again, and even better this time, was an astonishing accomplishment. It's been 10 years and STILL, people talk about The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight rivals The Avengers as to which comic book movie changed the game of the genre.With The Avengers, it showed how you can build an entire cinematic universe around individual characters just to have them come together and fight alongside each other.With The Dark Knight, it showed that comic book movies could go the extra mile, doing different things that you wouldn't expect from the genre. It's been called the comic book movie that even people who don't like comic book movies will watch.The Dark Knight takes the Batman character and puts him in situations that are not only very dangerous, but with a little pressure from The Joker (played brilliantly by Heath Ledger), it puts the main hero in a situation that has him questioning his own morals.The Dark Knight is the gold standard for superhero movies.",1
"The Dark Knight is an overwhelming experience. For a two and a half hour movie, it really goes by fast. I've seen it twice so far and I intend to see it again. The film's plot is simple: While Harvey Dent, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman try to bring down the Mob, the Joker outsmarts them at every turn. The fight to stop the Joker becomes more than a fight to stop crime, however. The Joker attempts to bring out the worst in everybody, to prove that we are all as mad as him. He targets the people that everybody holds most dear: hospital patients, civilians, politicians, cops, and the woman Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent love, Rachel Dawes. Batman and Harvey Dent have to struggle to prove they are better men than the Joker.Heath Ledger gives an outstanding performance as the Joker. He slips into the role like a glove, something Jack Nicholson really could not do because his personality was too strong. They utilized Ledger perfectly. He steals the show whenever he is on screen but it never feels like he is overshadowing Batman. One thing Christopher Nolan portrayed correctly was that the Joker is really only funny to himself. His ""humor"" is so sick I think audiences laugh only because they are uncomfortable. As many critics have noted, The Dark Knight works as a legitimate crime drama as well as a superhero movie. All of the Joker's schemes would fit right into a movie like Silence of the Lambs or Seven. They are so intense I was at the edge of my seat whenever he was on screen. I particularly liked his announcement to Gotham City that if a certain individual (can't recall his name) was not dead within 60 minutes, he would blow up a hospital. It was the perfect type of scheme for the Joker. With every scheme, explosion, and every person killed, the Joker pushes Batman to his limits.The entire cast gives an all around good job. Aaron Eckhart gives a good performance as Harvey Dent, at least as good as the script allowed him to. The combination of make-up and CGI for his face was perfect. Christian Bale was even more intense this time around, although his voice is sometimes grating. The scene where he interrogates the Joker is the most suspenseful scene in the movie. I should also note that the action scene editing was a major improvement over Batman Begins. Sometimes Nolan cuts a little too quickly but it is not as distracting this time.I only have a few minor criticisms (Big time SPOILERS). I still do not like Christopher Nolan's Gotham City. I understand he went for the modern look to give it a more realistic, serious feel, but Gotham has never looked modern in the comics. I just think Gotham should have a distinctive look. Maggie Gyllenhall, while better than Katie Holmes, sometimes acted a little out of character for an assistant D.A. Finally, I think they should have saved Two-Face for the third movie. Killing him off in this movie made his story feel a little rushed. I can't think of another Batman bad guy whose story can really compare to Harvey Dent's. They are going to have a tough time coming up with a bad guy for the third film. Nevertheless Harvey Dent's story arc is tragic and effective. Harvey Dent represented the hope and strength Gotham needed to overcome evil. He was written and portrayed a million times better than he was in Batman Forever. His fall from grace gives Joker the last laugh, and Batman has to cover up everything Two-Face did so as not to hurt Gotham's morale. Still, The Dark Knight is going to be hard to top, and I wish them good luck on the third installment. I look forward to seeing where they will take the Batman character. The Dark Knight stands towards the top of the list of best Superhero movies for its perfect portrayal of the characters and all around intensity.",1
"This is one of those films that seems to confuse a lot of people. Certainly the majority of my friends and family have said they were confused by it. I think that it's more likely they were unused to a film that doesn't do all the work for you.Do I wish to elaborate? No. If you watch it, really WATCH it, you'll love it, but if you want to spend more time looking at your phone (like one friend did) then you probably won't and that is yours, not the films.There is a lot of subtext to keep track of and there are a number of visual and audible references that only the quick witted will pick up on at first viewing.It is, however, like a good book: in that it gets better the second time around. In fact, the more you see it, the more references, hints and clues you'll be able to pick up on, and the more you'll appreciate the work that went into the film, I certainly didn't get them all first time round and doubt many (if any) could.Not much gets a 10/10 from me, but this does.So what are you waiting for?",1
One of the best movies I can remember seeing. Does it get any better? Layers on layers on layers and all the talent involved were perfection.,1
"The plot of the movie was one of the best ones that I have ever seen especially the fact that it treats in a dramatic and cinematic way one of the oldest and never answered mysteries of life and existence: what is real? and what is True - with capital T-. DiCaprio has done a great job and his acting was canonical here in that movie along with other actors. Because the theme of the movie is of philosophical nature it could not fully escape the paradoxes and the illogical and this is normal due the complexity of that topic. This made me think whether we are in a dream or we are like the inception in a augmented reality that we created for ourselves and how we know that we are really awake or dreaming. Maybe death as the kick of inception for us; it only awakens us to another layer of reality. The soundtrack of the movie is also inspiration with one of the french master pieces of music ""Je Ne Regrette Rien"" for Edith Piaf.",1

""THE DARK KNIGHT"" (after I saw it?it's my best movie of all time) some of you may say; what the hell you are talking about ,,where is the 'THE GODFATHER"" , well THE GODFATHER was my best movie of all time and I thought it will never change but what happened is a miracle.Batman Begins was the best comic-book film ever and it was one of the best C.Nolan's films (actually?exception of his debut film, Following¸ the man has never made a movie that didn't end up on IMDb top movies list, and my top ten list) , and comparing BB to TDK , BB look like an opening scene for TDK, it's really that's epic. TDK is epic, dark, emotional, that you don't want this movie end, you feel the chill from the beginning to the end, every scene is a gem to surround the crown (the film) , thanks from all my heart and the people who waited this movie and got what exceeded the world's imagination, thanks to whole crew from the director to the last person in this franchise .All the actors did memorable acting and I salute them for that,"" Bale""(my favorite actor because his capability mentally and physically) the only actor who justify Bruce Wayne ?Batman, ""Oldman"" makes you believe that they clowned Gordon from the comic, perfect, ""Caine"" the father Bruce didn't have and the adviser for him , ""Eckhart"" the white knight, the real Two-face, better than Tommy lee ?? hell yes,100000000000 times, the new face Maggie Gyllenhall who beautifully portrayed the love of Dent and Bruce ,she brought more softness than Kate,"" Freeman"" the thinking man for Wayne's company and Batman's supplier for gears and gadgets.And Of course the Oscar-worthy actor the late ""Heath Ledger ""who didn't just portrayed The Joker, he portrayed pure evil, chaotic , psychopath, Mass murderer and the bad ass villain of all time, the whole film I tried to find one proof that this guy wearing Joker make up is Heath but I couldn't ( you can't of course, Heath didn't locked up on himself month for nothing ) he bounded with the character like magnet, every scene he stole the show and every scene is a star on this movie ( my favorite scene is the pencil trick ) can he win an Oscar ???? Not just the Oscar, he must win every award known to human, he devoted himself to this role like he knew that he is going to die. (After Heath's performance as The Joker I am sure that any body will take his role will be in his shadow and will never top him, only if GOD will)Is it better than THE GODFATHER??? For me yes...But why??? THE GODFATHER is classic, original; you don't feel that you see a movie you feel this is a true story and you fell what the feel and the actors were the best of the best of their time? Now let's try that with TDK ,it's not classic but it well be with time ,original ,story that make you think Batman is on earth and living with us ,the atmosphere of the movie the screen writing the unbelievable acting, the phenomenal job Director , the great composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard how brought the real theme and the hunting music to this movie and make it epic and dark ,they really knew how to deliver a score about evil, chaos ,distraction ,hope ,courage, love, Hero, sacrifice and reality??.When you see TDK you don't see the comic superhero colorful and no-body-die thing, no here you see the real world of crime ,blood ,bombs ,the world is burning here, there is scene where Bruce telling Alfred : ( there is people dying Alfred what you want me to do ) or something like that , I mean this is not for kids, it's for adult , the plot will not be easy for the kids under 16 or even 18 to understand ????? I don't know what to say but this is will be on top of the movies for a long time, I hope, maybe till Nolan tell us that he will complete the trilogy and that will be such a risky move by him because I don't know how can he tops this movie but I hope he do and break the dreaded comic-book film trilogy curse.About the rating of ""IMDb's"" 250 film of all-time, as someone wrote: TDK will most definitely slide down the list. Why??? Because the jealous fans of movies that are in the top 10-20 will not like that TDK has bested their favorite movies, and these losers will spend the next weeks making multiple accounts and constantly voting the movie 1/10, this people will make it their life's job to find anyway possible to lower TDK's raring and bring it down. And I say to them what ever you do or what you going to do THE DARK KNIGHT HAS WON ,and it has dethroned THE GODFATHER as the #1 IMDb movie of all time , if only for a couple of days . There is NO OTHER movie done that, and it's the first movie of all time to cross more than $300 million in less than two weeks, and after TDK done his mission, KNOW WE (THE FANS) MUST CONTUNIE OUR MISSION BY SUPPORT THIS MOVIE AND SAVE IT FROM THE LOSERS WHO WANT TO BRING THIS MOVIE DOWN.Thanks and excuse my English??.",1
"The best Batman AND one of the best superhero movies of all time!This movie was perfection and will be hard to top - as another Batman film, or even an other superhero film. The closest being Ironman.Finally, an honestly reviewed film with the true overall average - 9/10.Stunning visuals, acting, writing and directing!A perfect 10/10 from me!",1
"The bottom line, is that this film was incredible from the acting all the way to the physical stunts throughout the movie. The joker was played with extreme talent and passion. I thought that this was a legitimate villain - rather than a simple comic book character. The whole movie idea and ""Gotham City"" seems real and throughout the movie, you realize what happens there, could indeed happen in real life.The promotion and advertisement for the movie was unbelievable. The nation was ready to sit back in the theater and enjoy an action-packed film with endless boundaries. People were so loyal in fact, when my girlfriend and I went, there was a line for our movie (that started at 11:00PM) by 9:30PM. Moreover, there was a line that began the exact same time for the IMAX showing, which started at 12:00AM.I've never experienced such a satisfied crowd at the end of the movie. The theater was filled with clapping and cheering - along with the occasional one person every now and then screaming ""Yeah!"" Go see the movie it's a good time, but not exactly for the whole family. It has some language and suggestive material, not to mention all of the various explosions and gunfights, so keep the smaller ones home.",1
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give us some of the most memorable performances of all times.  In this wonderful adaptation of S. Kings short story, the human spirit and hope triumph over injustice and ""the system"". It will make you think.  No doubt this will go down as one of the best dramatic movies of all times.  I can't say too much or I will spoil it.",1
I NEVER get tired of seeing this movie. I like period pieces. And the acting and cinematography is ON POINT. This is my favorite film.,1
"This movie is excellent. From all directions this movie reaches perfection. The writing, the score, the acting, the directing, the cinematography, even the lighting is done just right. All these elements working in concert make this movie easily one of the best movies ever made. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton together make for an outstanding performance. This is a movie that you can watch over and over. I catch something new each time I view it. It also leaves you feeling that everything is resolved, yet still wanting to see more. Brad Pitt's performance is another one for the books. Like in Snatch, Kalifornia, and 12 Monkeys, he has gone beyond the normal standard of good acting to bring one of the best performances of his lifetime. This movie is a real treat. Watch it.",1
"Was the perfect movie
it was the best series of batman movies i have been seen.",1
This movie fulfills my all expectation. Christopher Nolan tooks Batman an another place.,1
The best lovie ever made! Morgan Freeman forever. A+++++++++,1
This movie honestly is mind blowing and extremely difficult to understand. I've watched it severals times and still couldn't make it out thoroughly.,1
"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living, or get busy dying.Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up DOES rejoice. But still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.",1
"3 years after Batman begins people start talking about ""The Dark Knight"", and how good it was the film,i didn't understand the hype until i saw it one night on the TV, and it wasn't good, it was freaking awesome.For me, The Dark Knight its probably the best superhero movie to the date and i like to explain why:It was better than Batman Begins? Of course it was(at least for me), this movie repairs the aspects that Batman begins didn't do correctly(I still love Batman Begins) -The drama is spectacular. -its even darker than the first one. -The Car chase is awesome and its one of the best scenes of the movie. -The Action scenes are now great.Why its good by itself? -The casting again its great. -The soundtrack is as good as Batman begins. -The acting is fantastic. -The writing is good. -The Character Development is great, the movie makes every character interesting and important( more than Batman Begins) and it shows how important are their decisions and why the drama is spectacular.What about the villains? -The Joker, honestly for me and like everyone, was the best character and thing of the movie, its menacing, its scary, interesting and intimidating, again the acting is amazing.Heath Ledger did an amazing job.-I frankly didn't expect that Aaron Eckhart could play the role of Harvey Dent SO GOOD, he is just as scary and intimidating as the Joker(at least for me).My only concern is: -Harvey dent time screen( I would like to see more of this character in this film instead of a few scenes).But this is just a minor concern, at the end i think this movie works perfectly.For a 2.5 hour movie, i didn't get bored at any moment, not even when they show the replay again and again and again on TV, its still more interesting than other superhero movies, and one of my favorites. A highly recommended movie.10/10",1
Does anyone know who Tyler Durden is? Been hearing a lot about him...,1
"Of course I have not seen every comic book movie. I know that but of all the movies I have seen, this is by far the best. The dark side of this movie is so deep that at times it is hard to believe parents would take their 13-year-old kids to see this movie. Personally I would have nightmares if I was 13. Christian Bale pulls the batman role off perfectly. The joker leaves me speechless in every scene. There are no corny one-liners like you expect from a comic book movie: this is not Iron Man or Spider Man (although I did enjoy Iron Man). This series is so much more serious and creepier than the previous batman movies. Just looking at the Joker puts a chill down your spine. Seeing the events in the movie are enjoyable for everyone, you don't have to be a fan of the batman comics or comic books to include this movie in your all time favorites. I am not going to give Heath Ledger pity points. I have been excited about him playing the Joker since they announced it and he has lived up to my expectations and far surpassed them. I would not take your 7 year old boy to see this movie. PG-13 in this case means it. Heath Ledger's character is far scarier than any comic book villain I have ever seen. The dark parts of this movie make it unbelievable. Perhaps this is my personality speaking; my favorite album of all time is ""The Downward Spiral"" by Nine Inch Nails; but after seeing this movie Wednesday night I went home and listened to the entire album (not going to bed until past 5 am). When the credits start rolling and you see it read ""In memory of our friends Heath Ledger and Conway Wickliffe"" it hits you that Ledger is dead. This is his best performance (excluding ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"") and it makes you realize how brilliant he was and what a loss it is for him to be gone. But don't go into the movie with that on your mind. Enjoy the movie. I did. Is it my favorite movie of all time? No. But it is definitely in my top five.",1
"At its release, I had tried to watch ´Batman Begins´ on several occasions but hadn´t managed to follow the story. I therefore hadn´t felt like watching ´The Dark Knight´ until tonight.
It is as dark as the first one but I found a better control of the characters, a more interesting story, and the dark universe appropriately used.
There is great action, great acting, the story is interesting and makes sense.
I would ´only´ rate it 8 as there are other action films that are just as good. The difference here is probably the stunning performance Heath Ledger is delivering as the Joker that deserves a 10. To be watched in his loving memory.",1
The plot of the story is well scripted and played. Their is nothing less to except from a superhero movie,1
"You people I will never understand. Everyone who says this is a waste of time, read! First off whoever thinks they want to start there own Fight Club or thought the fighting was ""cool"" missed the whole point. Then the people who thought the movie was a heap of trash cause it was to preachy or what ever. Well you missed the boat. I can't explain why but the movie is so much more. You people are just scratching the surface of this killer movie. I never once to myself thought ""This would be cool if we really did it."" Or thought about fighting someone. If you think the movie was about fighting you totally just thought of the title and went in to it one minded. I saw this movie with a clear mind and was blown away. Watch again or for the first time. You will be happy!",1
"Great movie for all time!!!
Great script, great directing and a great twist at the end of the movie.
Revised 1,000 times!!!",1
"I love ""Batman Begins"" and was curious how they could top that as a Batman movie. I was never a huge fan of the Batman films of the 80's/90's and it was because I thought they were too flashy and colorful and not nearly dark enough. So, when ""Batman Begins"" came out I was psyched to see that they put a real human element and created a superhero that you believed could do half the stuff that he was doing! At the end of Batman Begins they announced the Joker would be the villain in the next film and I was a bit worried. Simply because every Joker I had seen was too comedic, and not dark enough. And then when I heard that Heath Ledger would be portraying him I really was worried. Not that I didn't think Heath was a good actor, in fact I thought he was great in the Patriot, and Brokeback Mountain, I just couldn't imagine such a ""handsome"" man playing the Joker.Chris Nolan's vision proved me wrong. MY GOD did Heath Ledger perform. I really wanted this Joker to be psychotic and I was fulfilled beyond my imagination! Ledger puts everything into this performance and it's creepy, funny, disturbing, and just plain brilliant. I know that no one could've imagined Ledger's tragic death, but even though he is gone I don't think Nolan planned to bring Joker back. I think when Joker says at the end ""We are destined to continue doing this forever"" to Batman it's Nolan telling us that it's an ongoing battle that batman will fight, but we don't need to see it so much.They should not bring the Joker back. To me it would be an insult to Ledgers performance. No one will top that, EVER! He was perfect in the role and that should cement that character on the silver screen for eternity.The rest of the cast is awesome as well. Bale as Batman/Wayne is great again. He is the best Batman/Wayne that there's been to date. And I like the fact that he said he'll be Batman until they want to bring in Robin. Please Hollywood, keep that sidekick out of the series. It just doesn't translate well on the big screen.So, why am I giving this 9 out of 10 stars and not 10. There is one scene that I thought did not belong in the movie, and it was near the beginning which had me a little worried at first. I understand the reasoning behind it, but I didn't like that they brought Scarecrow back for one scene. It felt, to me, like the actor that plays Scarecrow was looking for a paycheck and I didn't think they needed the ""Fake Batmen"" needed to be helping capture that villain. They could've just had some random thug, I don't know why they had to bring him back just for that.But, that is a very minor complaint and the movie is simply amazing. It's playing in Imax around here and I can't wait to go back and see it at that theater!",1
"The Dark Knight is the follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Now I thought Batman Begins was amazing, I mean it is one of my favorite films of all-time. To sum it up, I was very pumped about the sequel, but there was always that fear in the back of my mind that The Dark Knight might not be as good as Batman Begins, but finally after three years of waiting I can say that The Dark Knight is not just as good as Begins, but it in fact blows it out of the water. The story of The Dark Knight follows Batman on his continuing crusade to rid Gotham City of crime. In this film Batman begins to see hope for both him and Gotham in the hopes of the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent. Batman feels that Gotham needs a hero with a face, and he believes that Dent is that hero, not Batman. Of course, Batman's hopes are soon shattered by the arrival of a new criminal mastermind calling himself the Joker.As I have already said, The Dark Knight is amazing, you could call it a masterpiece, but that just doesn't seem to fully sum up how blown away I was by this film. To start, the directing by Christopher Nolan is superb, reinforcing once more that he is quite possibly the film industries greatest current filmmaker. On top of that the cinematography by Wally Pfister is amazing, and I really think it is about time he finally wins an Oscar for his work. Then the score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is perfect, fitting each scene perfectly. Finally the script by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan is perfect, flowing perfectly from scene to scene, making this 2 and a 1/2 hour film feel as if it lasted only 90 minutes, but in a good way. Of course the true highlight of the film is the acting from the all-star cast, all actors turn in perfect performances, including: Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart as D.A. Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Maggie Gyllennhaal replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes; though the one performance that truly stands out ahead of the others is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker, he was amazing, this role just fit him like a glove, and he truly deserves a post-humous Oscar win.In final thought, the Dark Knight is epic, emotional, and exciting, all at the same time. I loved this film, it was tense and disturbing while being at times a little comical through the Joker's odd, dark sense of humor. I could go on all day long talking about how perfect this film was, but I'll try to wrap things up here. The Dark Knight is easily the best film of 2008, and should definitely be considered for some big-time Oscars, in particular Heath Ledger's stunning performance as the Joker; but not only is The Dark Knight the year's best film, it is the best film of the decade thus far. The Dark Knight is the Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time, and definitely stands in my books as one of the Greatest Films of All-Time. It is a true masterpiece.The Dark Knight earns a perfect 10 out of 10!",1
I think that 'The Dark Knight' is one of the best films any film/batman fan can see. it is one of the most well written and directed films of the 21 century and i think it is Nolan's best film.,1
"I am aware this is a highly-regarded film and that knowledge perhaps added to my disappointment by raising my expectations. I found it had unique elements (the energetically sadistic Joker instead of earlier ""kid stuff"" incarnations) and - SPOILER - was surprised that two ""good guys,"" Dent and the love interest, got killed off, a very un-Hollywood twist. The positive surprise was the unusual nature of the extreme crisis that needed averting - the ""game theory"" played out on two cruise ships. I found this unique compared with the usual menaces posed by super-villains. But on the negative side, I found the film confusing, choppy, with discontinuities, full of pseudo-philosophical mumbo-jumbo, and with unexplained motivations - SPOILER - the thing with Dent at the end seemed contrived, merely an opportunity to display house-of-horror special effects - it did not convey what he was trying to accomplish and why. I see merit in the review by Stephanie Zacharek of Salon who was apparently not as taken with it as other reviewers.",1
"Envision the surreal psycho-drama of Being John Malkovich, pump in some testosterone overdrive and anti-establishment satire (and heck even a Sixth Sense twist at the end!) and I found myself in one of the downright craziest films ever. Also the soundtrack turns out to be one of the most distinctive along with that of The Matrix. Still I found it thoroughly enjoyable and deserves to be one of the must-watch titles of 1999. (A strong 7/10).",1
"Inception could honestly be considered a modern classic. It is a shame that DiCaprio didn't get as much recognition as deserved for this movie because he really did do a fantastic job. The supporting cast is very, very strong as well, this includes Molly which as a character makes the movie even more engaging. The premise is super unique and makes for an extremely interesting and different action movie experience. As a movie, it plays out similar to a heist film but with no actual heist and a much more complex plot.. Thanks to the dreaming concept, there are some points of special effects that are actually done really well and look/fit perfectly. This also applies to the well-timed speed changes, going from regular speed to slow-motion without feeling at all out of place. It is paced well and hits every beat that it tries to hit. Even if you don't particularly like the idea or genre of the film itself, I feel that it is a movie that everyone should see at some point as a representation of well-made film that takes advantage of modern effects without using them overwhelmingly.",1
"Batman is now cooler than ever with the new ""Dark Knight""! This film brings special effects, a better plot, and stellar acting into one combined session of three hours. It is worth every minute! This film shows us that even though most of us true fans knew the general synopsis of the film before it was released, you can tell true greatness, if after years and years of batman films, things still amaze you about this billionaire bat. Heath Ledger's Performance as the Joker is definitely an Oscar Nomination contender. If he doesn't win, then the system is flawed. His visionary and cunning lines stayed with me days after I viewed the movie. This movie is a must-see, and it is not rated #1 for nothing!",1
"its make me to love DC comics""The Dark Knight"" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.",1
"I took a course of film criticism and it was a requirement to watch a film called ""The Shawshank Redemption"". My first thought was quite negative because it was an old movie made in 1994. However, after I watched it yesterday, it was so impressive.The Shawshank Redemption is a story about Andy Dufresne who is a banker was convicted of murdering his wife so he was caught to the fictional shaw shank stage. Things that happened in shaw shank were terrible but he had a friend named ""Red"" who always supported him. Moreover, he was a genius person so he did everything he could to make things better. In fact, every single thing that he has done, he did it in purpose. And that consequence was over my expectation. What I like most is the story line and the plot was perfect. I really like how the story has been laid out and it always surprised me. You cannot guess what will happen next or even why the character does such things. Furthermore, I really like the main characters; Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, because their acts were so natural",1
"Ledger is irresistibly interesting in his portrayal of the Joker despite the somewhat hackneyed plot, and his performance saves the film from disaster. Without his performance I would have walked out as the rest of the film was trite, melodramatic, garbage.Christian Bale gives wood a bad name as he soullessly meanders through the role. The guttural growling he performs as Batman may make sense to the plot but its almost unbearable to listen to .The previous film with Bale a beaten down outcast and a man struggling for an identity was infinitely more interesting from an acting perspective than this film. Bale feels trapped in the role in this film going through the motions and he seems bored and unchallenged almost not knowing what to do with it. The plot also doesn't have the structure of the previous film. There was a appreciable beginning, middle, and end of the previous film that let things percolate, the action build, the plot be exposed.This film is too evenly paced and like an unstructured watercolor the plot runs together and gets lost somewhere along the line.(or maybe I just lost interest) I remember seeing a scene with the Joker in a nurses costume, and while the character was interesting not knowing or caring at that point why the Joker was blowing the place up. The Two-Face character was fairly weak, the emotions in the wronged Harvey Dent seemed forced and the plot explanation of his 'do-gooder' gone wrong personality seemed ham-fisted. Maggie Gyllenhaal was not a particularly interesting character and there were no fireworks between her and either Bale or Eckhart. Michael Caine almost seemed to be biting his lips to spit out the lines in the film. He seems to be almost embarrassed to be in the film. Acting wise the highlights are Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and of course Heath Ledger who you never doubt 100% inhabit their parts and actually add something positive to the film.Unfortunately they are fighting an uneven script, a hackneyed story, and bad acting from Bale and others the whole way.The result is an uneven, and eventually uninteresting film that relies on constant action and superficial delights to offset the uneven acting and flat out bad plot. Certainly inferior to its predecessor and without Ledger would have been an outright disaster. I feel a bit alone on this analysis and I am surprised as anyone about this as I was expecting greatness when I went into the theater. But thats the way the cookie crumbles.",1
"It's the best movie I have ever seen. The plot twists, the action and lets not forget tons of topless Brad Pitt. Edward Norton's acting is out of this world. Brad Pitt is fantastic. If you like Brad Pitt you'll die after seeing this movie. He is so incredibly sexy its unbelivable. Edwards Norton's a cutie so if you like movies that are good and have attractive men in it I suggest Fight Club. Guys can also watch it due to the amount of action.",1
"Amazing movie. The actors are great and dialogues are incredible. Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner. This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.",1
"Writer and Director Christopher Nolan combines the mysteries of dream control, chasing one's past and an action thriller that mimics the unevenness and secret agenda world of dreams itself. While no character truly shines, it is the concept of ideas, ideals and levels of denial that are up front and personal. Gotta love movies that leave you questioning your own choices and their results. Certainly, the cast being portrayed as a super hero team of sorts was a bit sophomoric, but the way various dream worlds are created, manipulated and destroyed here made a clever statement about human nature. I can't wait to see it again for more will be revealed!",1
"Having always heard and being familiar about Fight Club and somewhat hearing little by little its twist ending (but not completely knowing the full details), and only now watching the film for the first time 21+ years later its release. Understood its high praise from fans, and as to why many consider it one of the favorite films among one of the greatest films of all time.Fight Club most definitely seems to be a film which caters towards the teens to 20/early 30's crowd of people. From the directing to the acting, to the dialogue and scenery, everything is done in a very stylish and ""cool"" sort of way. The entire film has that factor which is appealing and engaging to many people (including oneself).Everything which has been said and praised about the film has already been said. From the twist (which is somewhat confusing but also in a way predictable), but its keeps it engaging throughout. The film does start off really well, then comes a little downhill in its second half (around the time the ""Project Mayhem"" is introduced) but it's still enjoyable, and the twist is enjoyable to see it unfold.The performances of both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt alone are what make this movie worth the watch. Both of them on screen (especially Pitt) are highly captivating. Helena Bonham Carter also does a solid job, and Meat Loaf also stands out.From the surface level, this film may seem like it's only about fighting and a group of men gathering in groups to fight one another in underground settings. But given that it is based on a novel (not many people are aware), the little subtle intangibles are quite clever and keeps people guessing. It is more complex than most may initially suspect. Also the fact there are many different theories about certain parts/things of the film, tells us that this is more than a film simply about fighting.For a film to be over 20 years old, and still people are commenting/reviewing and discussing it, tells us that it is a classic and one of the most well known and popular films. This is a film which stays with you after watching it and may still be one your mind a day or so later. As more time passes, we assume the next generation will watch the film for the first time, and have similar opinions and thoughts. Perhaps Fight Club was ahead of it's time released in 1999.",1
"Very well done movie although I don't think it's as good as everybody says... One of the better movies I have watched and it is absolutely worth looking at it, no doubt! Unfortunately I don't like it so much anymore. That can depend on the amount of times I have watched it over the years at school etc. and it has gradually become a little more boring and I don't enjoy it as other movies like Batman. As a Tarantino fan I like more brutality in movies than drama. The actors, story and the quotes in the movie is a big plus though! If you like movies or TV-series that is inside a prison I strongly recommend the TV-series ""Prison Break"". Well, back to the topic. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that is worth watching. If you haven't seen it before it will be a very good movie to watch with your family or friends. As I said earlier I don't like it that much these days but it feels more like it's not really my cup of tea... I give it a 9 out of 10, fare and square. /Andreas Flink",1
"One of my best movie till date.. Bread pit plays a extraordinary role.. superb acting, superb plot, excellent storyline",1
"I saw an excellent commentary on this movie called ""The dark masterpiece"" and you just have to agree. Simply the best movie i've ever seen. You think that comic books movies are just movies that you just remember for a short while and so on. But not this, this movie has totally changed my opinion of these movies called ""comic books movies"".Christian Bale is excellent as in Batman Begins, Heath ""The Joker"" Ledger does the best role i've ever seen in a movie. Totally blown away by Heath's performance as The Joker. Michael Caine, is great, Morgan Freeman does what he always does, a great role. Maggie, great too. But you forget that Aaron Eckhart does a excellent performance as ""two-face"". I actually liked him better as ""Two-Face"" than Harvey Dent.You have heard everything before, this movie is great and if you haven't seen it yet, you have too do go and see this masterpiece by Cristopher Nolan, great job with the movie, his best and the best movie ever. Batman The Dark Knight, the best movie ever ? I think so.",1
"I have considered for a long time whether this films justifies 10/10 or not, but have come the conclusion that it does. I think this film is as close to film perfection as it comes. Multi layered, but not so much that it will lose the viewer. Nolan does it again and raises the bar even higher than he has before. The story is meticulously planned, and the lack (where possible) of affects and CGI add to the enjoyment. The performances of Di Caprio (who I have not always been a fan of) Cottilard, Hardy, Levitt, Caine and Hardy top it all off. One of the best films ever made.",1
"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",1
"I give this film 9 out of 10, and your only question should be ""why should it lose a mark, why not 10 out of 10?"" and that is indeed a fair question.The lost mark is because when I watched the film for the first time I had no idea how amazing it was going to be, and the slightly slow build up risked me changing channel. I see the same reaction when I try to get other people to watch the film, as their interest wanes I have to say ""no, stick with it!"". And 'stick with it' you should.This film literally changed my life. A share a lot of the views of the lead character and to see this expressed on the big screen is comforting, fun, scary, weird, exciting, eye-opening.This is the only film that I had to watch for a second time immediately and it was like being immersed in a whole new story.I was very fortunate knowing nothing about the film when I first watched it so I wasn't looking out for a twist, so the twist got me hook line and sinker. If you haven't seen the film yet, don't try to guess the twist, let it hit you at the appropriate time.A superb film worthy of its high ranking.",1
"When the word EPIC loses its meaning, Inception is a movie that does more than anyone ever imagined to do and deserves to be called movie of the decade if not of the century. It's not just the visual pleasure that the amazing effects give you, it's not just the breathtaking thrill throughout the whole movie when you hold your breath constantly waiting for answers, it's also the amazing amount of talent put in this film by its creator Christopher Nolan and the actors that delivered his vision to the audience. A performance from Leonardo Di Caprio that deserved an Academy Award he didn't get this year. The story takes you in a journey through Nolan's view on dream world and never makes you bored, it's extremely interesting with wonderful pace, it's fun, thrilling and ends in one of the best ending scenes ever made. Seriously, it's so difficult to try and review such a masterpiece, such a wonderful piece of art, that this movie is. Inception is not only a must-watch it's a life-changing and incredibly unique experience that everyone needs to be a part of.",1
"With most movies you can tell how it's gonna end just by reading the back of the case. This is far removed from that norm. The characters, the side plots, and the tantalizing hints of what it's yet to reveal all make for an excellent story where you really can't tell what happens next. It's also not a movie you can just start watching half way through and know exactly what's going on. You need to pay attention to every second of every seen, focusing on the details, what they mean, and how the start revolves around one particular one. Overall, Christopher Nolan has outdone himself yet again.",1
"A film that perfects a revitalized superheroes genre with its predecessor in the series of the man-bat, we see a mature movie with all the necessary ingredients to make it popular and a cult movie at the same time. Action, suspense, humor, and drama. It sticks to the original characters, it makes them real. There was a great study of the whole history and that was embodied to the screen with brilliant acting of Bale and Ledger and all the supporting cast. Nolan makes justice to the comics that deserved a masterpiece like this one. Batman Begins was truly necessary to finally get this great movie, although if you know the story, it keeps independence with the first part. Totally recommended.",1
I think IT was a Nice and cool film. I have eliteserien to see IT for a long time. Now am bloween away...,1
"I couldn't have asked for a more direct movie. I am so glad this movie was made. Thanks so much for making it. From what i was told bout prison from my friend he told me that this movie was a dead ringer. It makes me never want to go to prison. After seeing this movie i cried my eyes out for about a good 24 hrs.. Yes i know that makes me a cry baby, but i don't care. This movie is definitely a tear jerker. Thanks again. This movie has everything about a day to day life in a prison from sun up to bed time. Remember that prison isn't a laughing matter.This movie has showed me what a crap hole prison can be.",1
It deserves this rating. It is wonderful :) It is a classic movie which everyone must watch.,1
"I was really looking forward to seeing this film and, as a summer blockbuster, it certainly doesn't disappoint. If you are looking for well-executed action (though some of it is confusingly edited) solid acting from a good cast and unnerving tension then this certainly is the film for you. Chris Nolan proves to be skilfully adept at maintaining nerve-wracking tension throughout the second half of this film and I was genuinely not sure which characters would still be alive at the end, something which is no mean feat considering the formulaic nature of most modern blockbusters. The overwhelming feeling of dread which pervades this picture has been skillfully created by a director who has managed to seamlessly integrate an excellent sound-track with dark but beautiful cinematography and unusually committed performances from an ensemble cast, the strongest of which coming from Heath Ledger, who manages to invest the Joker with a surprisingly malevolent presence for a summer film.Unfortunately, much of this is undone by a script and story which fails to support the hard-work of both the director and cast. Whilst the film purports to explore deep and disturbing issues relating to madness and heroism, the script isn't half as clever as it thinks it is. Yes, the Joker is vividly painted as an unnerving agent of chaos who's objective is to reveal the dark underbelly of human nature, but the scriptwriter is denied the opportunity to fully explore the questions raised by this character because of the wham-bam demands of summer action movies. The audience is instead subjected to a series of gruelling hostage situations which, whilst effectively intense, are too numerous and unrelenting for the director to explore the psychological effects these scenarios have on the rest of the cast, thus depriving the Joker of much of his potency.Added to this is a ridiculous story which simply fails to adhere to logic or reason. Yes, the Joker is meant to be a criminal mastermind, but even he does not have the power to read the future and many of his schemes are simply impossible to execute. SPOILER The most improbable story development has to be the revelation that the Joker planned all along to be captured by the police mid-film and has already devised a means of escape. The Joker simply has no time to come up with his alternate scheme of taking both Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes hostage any plausible explanations made by fans of the film for many of the plot-twists and turns simply hold no water. SPOILER For a film that prides itself in translating the Batman mythos into a recognisable reality the implausible story only serves to remind the viewer that, despite all of the skill that has gone into developing The Dark Knight, this is only a summer blockbuster after all and it is certainly not the dark masterpiece that many have claimed it to be.",1
Before I saw this movie I wasn't sure if I was ever going to see something that I would consider perfect. This is absolutely my favourite film of all time it has absolutely everything going for it. The premise is incredibly smart and unique and is executed in a way that allows the viewer to discover things for themselves. The cast is top notch in this movie with Leonardo Dicaprio the stand showing that he has true knowledge of this subject. The rest of the cast does everything right and all have perfect chemistry with each other. The heist itself was so well done and mad me fell as if I was in a dream and anything could go wrong at any time. The heist gets more and more intense with every passing moment and the ending literally turned my mind against itself as I do this day am still trying to figure it out. This made Christopher Nolan one of the greatest directors of all time and made a movie that I consider to be perfect.,1
"Excellent. All of them. Nolan, Ledger, Bale, Eckhart... Movie deserves it's place. It is great. Simply great. I will watch it many and many times. It's not just a screen adaptation of a comic book. It is more. Many more. It is done with heart and ambitions. It has just the right portion of action, because if you want to see mindless action movie, go to see Transporter 3 instead of this. I am so sorry that I didn't notice Ledger before, because his Joker is simply brilliant. In one moment I realized that he is the one in this movie. He absolutely steals the picture from other actors. And I do say that he deserves ans Oscar. Every his phrase, every motion is just genius. That reminded me of ""The Crow"" in which Brandon Lee played his last role. Maybe both of them knew that they will die and did their best to stay in our hearts forever... I can say many more about this movie, but I won't. You have to see it for yourself...",1
"Heath, Heath, Heath, yada yada yada. Yes, he did a lovely Joker. So what? The film was almost as tedious as the rest of them. The obvious problems:* Too long!* Shallow stabs at moral seriousness.* Absurdly over-processed Batman voice.* The usual barely-there female characters.* Heath's Joker was just another lunatic villain, and we've seen plenty of similar quality over the years. *gasp* ? heresy!Yes, in my opinion, Heath was merely okay.Making a villainous virtue out of the Joker having no purpose but to ""make the world burn"" is not ""deep."" It's not that hard to create a charismatic psycho character. Yes, he had some game. Yes, of course, I enjoyed lines like ""I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught one."" This movie wasn't completely awful. I'm giving it five stars, after all (which guarantees no one will read my comment, but oh well).But neither Heath nor the film as a whole was ""amazing.""I'm not a superhero movie hater, and I've actually read plenty of Batman comics in my life (unlike at least half the people getting excited about this film, I think). But I have been bored and disappointed by the Batman franchise films every time, so this is no surprise. I can't even wrap my head around this one being fun, light entertainment (or any other kind of entertainment), let alone a ""classic"" as so many are calling it.A classic? As GOB would say, ""Come on!"" If you are calling this movie a classic, you can't possibly have seen many movies!",1
"so what do you guys think, huh! that all batman movies will be crappy like batman forever but chris Nolan proved that batman is back and will compete with the spider man movies after batman begins. but he took the whole batman movie to the next level through this movie. the thing is that it has a plot and not like other superhero stories where the plot is weak and only action is the main base. heath ledger is the best and even Christian bale is rocking. of course we can't forget Aaron Eckhart for his role as Harvey dent and his one liner""you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain"". i suggest u guys please watch it because it is one of the greatest superhero movies ever. enjoy it thoroughly",1
"One of the best film ever, using every old cinema good uses. Best to watch, seen it many times !Every body should see this film once time in their life.Good actors, good place to shoot, a captive story line.So many beautiful shoots, good music, from the beginning to the end it was a immersive film.",1
"Personally I think this movie was awesome. Sure, I was super-annoyed at the amount of bad language in there. The atmosphere was just evil, I mean, it's a really dark movie, but I can really enjoy that, with a movie at least, and I thoroughly enjoyed it with this one. WOW, how did they ever come up with this.Camera shots were SUPER! Great creative angles, and stuff, you know, I'm not that good a critic, just LOVED the camera work.I really had to keep my wits about me to understand the plot line, it has soooo much potential of becoming major confusing, but that's just awesome... if you like it like I do that is... LOL.Surprises all over the place, and believe it or not, with all the crappy language, and all the bitter violence, I laughed my *ss off several times as well!!!HOW DID THEY DO THAT?I really dunno.* I laughed like crazy. * I was totally grossed out many times. * I was horrified right down to my gut at the realism. * I was surprised at all the twists in the plot, creativeness, originality of everything. * I was completely taken up in the characters. * I was stunned by the numerous stabs to society, sociology and life in general.Man, I cannot possibly explain this, but normally I would have hated this movie, but this, this was so well done, I can only love it.Although I probably won't watch it again, now that I know what's coming.",1
"Batman continues to wage war on crime with the help of Alfred, Gordon, and Lucius Fox. Yet someone is silently pulling the strings, laughing while he does it. THe Joker. He forces Gotham's White Knight to the edge of his sanity and pushes Batman to the point where he may cross hisonce fine line between hero, and Vigilante. Overall excellent film for Batman not exactly a family movie but definitely something to spend your money on. Bale is a natural yet we can't ignore Ledger who takes up the mantle of the Joker perfectly. A must see film.10 stars.",1
"Let me first begin by saying this: The Joker is the new Captain Jack Sparrow.Yes, we've heard the hype, the tragedy, the Oscar predictions, and let me defuse all of these arguments with an emphatic response: Heath Ledger is a phoenix. We will be hearing glorifications about his performance as the Joker, well and beyond the contrived Oscar ceremonies. Heath Ledger is this movie. Heath Ledger is the embodiment, and rebirth, of not only method acting, but the dynamics of a well-textured character. What i mean to say is, in a world where neo-Hollywood patronizes the idea that a story needs character, Heath Ledger is a convincing testament to a milestone that will either be doomed to fall into pop-culture palaver or rightly take it's place among one of the best acted, and scoped, villains of all time. The Joker is an anachronism, where the zeitgeist is: flat character + bump action = $$$. I can't stress this enough, we need more Jokers, seriously Hollywood, Why so serious? Let me move on to the rest of the movie, although i'd rather just gush about Heath Ledger.Christian Bale really fleshes Bruce Wayne out. I've heard the movie was dark, i've even heard it compared to film-noir (which is slightly obtuse), but the fact of the matter is, this film requires a genre all onto itself, be it, Dark-Noir. The reason i bring this point up, is because, it capitalizes on the dark side of every character in the movie. Gordon, Dent, Wayne, etc. this film is an exposure of negatives, an exposure of human morality, and most importantly, the exposure of human corruption, inevitable human corruption. This film is real, there is no other way about it.But yes, i've digressed, here's the skinny on the characters: Bruce Wayne becomes dark, which is refreshing to the social playboy billionaire syndrome. I felt Bale was reminiscent of Michael Keaton here. The only fault i have with Bale, as i had with the first film is, the breathy vernacular he employs whilst playing Batman, that teeters on cheesy and well, cheesy. But, i must admit, if it wasn't for the overshadowing aspect of Ledger's performance, Bale would shine throughout this movie. He adds depth to the already pitfalled desperation of Bruce Wayne.Maggie Gyllenhaal does a fine job of covering the footsteps of Katie Holmes (which i thought did a fine job in the first film). The thing i appreciated about her was, she didn't superimpose her trade-mark zany, neurotic, girl-with-a-punch, characterization to her role as Rachel Dawes.Gary Oldman does a great job once again. Also, keeping in check his idiosyncratic acting tendencies. He plays it cool, cautious, but also slides into scenes with a demanding presence as not just a off-kilter commissioner, but a man behind the cop suit. Too many times, the cop is just a guy in a uniform with a badge, Oldman makes the audience empathize with him, and not just through obligatory sympathies towards the, ""good cop"" staple.Aaron Eckhart, as soon to be, Two-Face, paths the road for the third installment. In fact, one thing I fault Nolan for with this movie is, it is more of a transitional succession, rather than a stand alone. People will gawk at me for this, but yes, I said it. I can't complain about Aaron, nor really can I about any character, the only downside to his role is, the campy CGI that becomes applied to his face. Enough is enough, no more CGI! It always looks terrible.So, that all being said, see this movie. Twice. Three times. As many times. It has something for everyone, okay, maybe not the Sex and the City crowd, but who cares. Four under thought understatements: action is great, music is great, cinematography is great, and suspense, wow-wee, nail biting! This movie is not only an ode to the absurd (yes, absurd) talent of the late Heath Ledger, but an ode to the suppression of lackluster movie-goers demanding: Viva La Cinema.So, please, dance with the devil by the pale moonlight, see the Dark Knight.",1
"The movie has very deep content, I also find it interesting 2 times",1
"Fight Club (1999)Such an inventive, twisting, intelligent, seamless movie you'll rarely rarely find. If you want logic or sunshine, forget about it. If you don't mind diving down, getting lost, gasping, and shaking your head in appreciative amazement, this is your movie. Any number of things could go wrong when you have so much depending on the two main male characters each presenting a psychology meant to be a yin and yang pairing, but nothing goes wrong here. Brad Pitt is confident, virile, beautiful in every way that Edward Norton is not. When they meet, so to speak, Norton is transformed, and the wild events that follow seem vaguely possible, even if patently impossible. It's a crazy ride and a beautiful one, dark and funny, and even a little romantic (the woman sidekick is played to perfection by Helena Bonham Carter). Chuck Palahniuk's novel is the basis for all this inventive insanity, and you give director David Fincher credit for even thinking it was filmable. It was a huge effort in every way--assembling the cast, arranging all the special effects, creating the dark and drained color palette, working in the spasmodic soundtrack (effects and music both), on and on. Not to mention just editing it so that it made sense. Which it does. Fincher is a music video director at heart, and that feel is not lost here, to his benefit (the two other films of his I've seen are also visually athletic, the archetypally atmospheric Se7en and the more straight up Panic Room).Fight Club has to be seen for what it is. When I first saw it a year ago, finally, it struck me as trying too hard, and a little outlandish, I mean, it's all so improbable, life on steroids and with sunglasses on in the dark. But this time all this craziness was exactly right, and within the film, within the rules of this special universe inside the film itself, it isn't crazy at all, but convincing and gut level perfect. Step away and don't look back. Perfect stuff.",1
"My favourite movie since I was a child. I can't imagine going into the profession of acting without the hundreds of viewings I seem to have given this title. Stellar acting and storytelling, not a single wasteful moment of screentime and the music choices were incredible.",1
"Great movie
Great performance for de cabrio
And sure great direction",1
"It's perfect. Start to finish heath ledger steals the screen as the joker. Ledger is genuinely intimidating leaving us excluded from the joke which makes us fear him as wild card and ""agent of chaos"" even more so. The rest of the characters are amazing and deliver a wonderful and believable performance in this real-world adaptation of The Batman but this is very much Ledgers film and rightly so. In my opinion, the best movie I've ever watched to date",1
"I Don't know how many times i have watched this movie and i know i will definitely watch it again,but this movie always inspire me whenever i lost my hope and got imprisoned by fear of failure and wrongdoings,it helps to conquer this premise.i often thrown in to oblivion,whenever i have no idea about what to do, the one quote made me busy with my life is ""Get busy living or Get busy dying"". In fact,quotes from the movie stick to my desktop which could not be removed even by myself.Furthermore,the climax of the movie made me shocked as well as concluded the bottom line ""Hope is a Good Thing"" which i still follow and forever.",1
"Too bad IMDb doesn't have an 11/10 rating option. Because if it did, I would most assuredly give it that rating. Yes my friends, it is THAT GOOD.For a 2 hr 30 min movie, there wasn't a single dull moment. Right from the beginning it grabs you and just keeps going. This movie is relentless. It was the fastest 2 + hours I've ever experienced.I was worried about the huge amount of hype surrounding it, but this movie EXCEEDED my expectations.Not one bad performance to be had in the entire ensemble. Heath Ledger is who everyone's been talking about, but Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart do outstanding jobs as well. Too bad for them, they will most likely get half the recognition Ledger gets.This movie is very dark and very grim. and it almost had a feeling of Empire Strikes Back, in that the bad guys have Batman not only outmatched, but they have him questioning himself and what he believes in.As soon as I got done watching this movie, I wanted to see it again. Sure, there's plenty of things you can nit-pick about, but that's the case with ALL movies. The ""flaws"" are so incredibly small that you won't even notice them.See this movie and see it again. It's SO much more than just a ""superhero"" summer blockbuster.",1
"The first time I saw Shawshank, I loved it and didn't want it to end. I remember that desire being surprisingly powerful, despite understanding that I had enjoyed it as much as I did while watching it. Its power surprised me because I didn't understand fully how or why I felt the way I did. On subsequent viewings, I prepared myself for the ending, for THAT feeling, which I began to examine. I would describe it as something on par with the end of a relationship, if not perfectly in scale, then certainly in context. A good relationship. One that ends too early, but does so because it must, because that is just how it is sometimes. I am always struck with a deep yearning to see more, to know and feel more, but also a comfort. That even though I didn't get everything I wanted, what I got is a damn sight good enough, and I should be grateful for that. But it aches, too. And then you realize that it's over, and you're going to wake up tomorrow, and start living your life again. But now you'll live having gone through this, with this perspective, this story in your memory. It's small, not actually the same experience, but it's close. The same shape and color. No other film, no story, gives me this feeling. And just like in relationships, sometimes I end up watching nothing but disappointing titles, I have a moment when I ask myself why I do it. That maybe I'm wasting my time. And then I remember. And then I hope.",1
"Fight Club has got to be one of the best films ever made, it completely demonstrates what happens when consumer technology and pop-culture society takes over our natural order.David Fincher is a genius, he's made one of the most memorable and funny films any one could possible imagine coming from Chuck Palahniuk's provocative novel.All the actors make a mark on their characters, especially Edward Norton as the disillusioned Narrator. I love everything about each Fincher film made, but fight club contains everything you need in a film. Mischief, mayhem and soap",1
this goes without saying but the dark knight is one the greatest movies of this generation. when it comes to superhero movies the villains performances usually make or break the movie and this movie proves that. obviously heath ledger's acting is the most memorable thing about this movie but the acting from the whole cast is flawless. Aaron Eckhart is shadowed by Ledgers acting. Eckhart was so good in this movie I think that if the circumstances were different he could have been the only villain in the movie and people would've fine with it. this movie is one of the reasons why liking super heroes is now cool. he main reason that this movie is the greatest super hero movie ever is because of the darkness that this movie has. it completely changed the way that I look at movies. and that the movie isn't as animated as other super hero movies makes it that much better.,1
"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFrank Darabout's first directorial credit is a masterpiece. Shawshank is a film that must be experienced by everyone young and old. It has a touching, powerful, and heartfelt story. It has complex characters and a detailed storyline. Even after 20+ years, Shawshank holds its own as a masterclass film.The acting is great. Tim Robbins gives the best performance of his career. Morgan Freeman also delivers a wonderous performance. All of the supporting characters add so much to the story.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is good at just under two and a half hours.All in all, this film truly does belong at the top of IMDb's Top 250. It is a powerful film that deserved to win some Oscars. Pros: Touching, powerful, and heartfelt story, amazing acting, good pacing, a good runtime, wonderful supporting characters, and great directing by Frank DaraboutCons: NoneOverall Rating: 10",1

"Normally a summer blockbuster this huge can never (for some reason) deliver on both acting and the usual crazy action. Most of what happens in this movie is pretty bad and i mean bad. But i am not going to spoil that for you. I have never seen a movie as brilliant as this. Every scene in the movie has to be there, for if you wood just scrap it the movie would somehow collapse, because there is a bit of information the audience did not get. And I have to say that this Christopher Nolan batman franchise is really up there (for me) with ""star wars"" Indiana Jones"" and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. This story really tells you why the joker is who he is, and why batman becomes who he must become. Because this joker is all about destruction and chaos. Really looking forward to the dark knight rises.",1
"oh...my...god...i just recently saw this. one word sums it up, unbelievable. this movie is what i have been waiting for since the 1976 classic, Network. ok, if you're female, you might not like it, but if you do, good for you! you obviously have some good taste and are willing to try out something new. anyway, fight club has some of the most fantastic psychological elements i have EVER seen. the lines are amazing, the acting is perfect, and the story has so many twists and turns, you'll be spinning in your chair, hehe. this movie made realize a few things we take for granted in life, and freaked the hell out of my roomate, heh. this is the movie to see if you love mind trips!",1
"The Dark Knight is a great movie.Unfortunately, little niggly things keep it from being truly great. Editing choices, pacing of certain scenes, omitted scenes where we are left to assume something has happened, all keep it from being the organic experience Batman Begins was. The story is also a lot denser and cluttered, which isn't a bad thing in itself of course. But I felt that the time taken just to remember who was who (and what they looked like when we briefly saw them 30 minutes earlier in the film) kept getting in the way of me just absorbing the movie.The one thing that I felt was truly brilliant about Batman Begins was that it was a movie you could ""feel"", the story didn't get in the way of the atmosphere the filmmakers were trying to create. It felt like they had stripped the dialog down to the bare minimum, and they left the rest of the storytelling to the music and visuals. I thought it felt much more focused and engaging. This focus on atmosphere, and delivering the emotional heart of the film through music, also allowed them to take some, when viewed out of context, fairly cheesy or out-of-place lines of dialog, and somehow make them very powerful and moving, even memorable.If they release a Director's Cut of The Dark Knight, where they have my permission to gladly add 20 minutes of material removed during editing (gore and violence scenes, possibly small omitted scenes needed to make the story flow better and to make the narrative a bit more clear and engaging rather than feeling like you are just crudely hopping between scenes at times), then The Dark Knight could be as awesome as it might be able to be.A good example of the problems the movie suffers from can be found when you examine the use of the musical score in the film. In Batman Begins there were many long scenes where the music was allowed to really take its time, to build emotionally over several minutes and really carry the film from an emotional viewpoint. In The Dark Knight, there are almost no such moments. Sometiems there is a touching 20 second scene crammed between 2 violent or chaotic scenes, and the music tries desperately to infuse some emotional support for that scene, which is almost pointless when it happens. 20 seconds isn't nearly enough to take a viewer from excited to feeling sadness or love. Instead it almost feels kind of insulting when you realize what just happened, and it takes you out of the movie a bit as well.Overall I feel it is a great movie with great acting, great action and a rich and engaging story which is more eventful and dense than the first film. The fact that I felt the movie (already well over 2 hours long) could have benefited from another 20 minutes of material, to sort out some moments of unclarity and just make the story more engaging and connected, speaks volumes about the quality of the quality work represented on screen. But certain issues, with unnatural scene progressions, too tight editing that doesn't allow the emotional message in a scene to fully sink in, editing that skips between events too much rather than taking one thing at a time, and omitted scenes or events, together with a story that I feel could really benefit from extended scenes and more room to breathe at times, keeps it from being as emotionally engaging and essential as Batman Begins was.I give it 8/10, but the more time passes since I saw it, the more it's leaning towards a solid 7/10.",1
when Hollywood starts to mess with your mind they get an audience!inception is a well done masterpiece by christopher nolan and will remain that way forever.when you first watch the movie the story line is confusing but once you watch it a second time you should grasp it. confusion was mainly due to the fact that sometimes you couldn't tell if the characters were in a dream or not.but like i said watching the movie a second time makes you understand.inception rules the sci-fi genre along with some other great hits like star wars and terminater but overall i think inception is the best one of them all. I don't recommend this movie for little kids for 2 reasons.one it is too violent.two they wont get whats happening at all.this is a movie you really have to pay lots of attention to as it is a fast paced movie.another interesting aspect of the movie is how they go into dreams within dreams.its a cool aspect and makes the conflict change a lot!check out inception and you wont be disappointed!!,1
"Christopher Nolan brings us ""Inception"", a movie about dreams and the capability of changing them. What would you do if you could change the future by introducing an idea into others people dreams? ""Inception"" is about a group of people who tries to change one man's mind by manipulating dreams. This idea drives us into a spectacular adventure where minute after minute, the group of people goes deeper to accomplish their mission. With an impressive storyline and an amazing cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Cane and more), ""Inception"" is one of those movies you will definitely remember for a long time. After the well conceived ""The Dark Knight"", this movie is another example of Nolan's outstanding talent. Therefore, ""Inception"" scores 9 out of 10.",1
"Nolan has done it again...There are just so many movies that are made such a hype about but so few that actually live up to that hype...and Inception does that and more!! The Star cast is so well picked out and each one has played their parts outstandingly! (A special mention for Tom Hardy) DiCaprio was just as great as he is in all of his movies, he's my favorite actor of all time and can't wait for his next! And Oh, the MUSIC....JUST WOW!!! You may however think the movie is just a bit slow, but worth it in the end!! The last scene alone makes the movie worth watching twice at least!!",1
"I'm very fond of movies that explore new territory. Also, I'm a very frequent dreamer, which I could go on and on about, but that's irrelevant. However, I make this point because this movie depicts the subconscious in dreams, and it does so in a very intriguing way.The movie is based around invading peoples minds while they are asleep, essentially going into somebody's dream and trying to accomplish something (such as extracting information or, as the title suggests, ""inception"", in which an idea is planted). Therefore, many of the sequences in the movie are taking place in somebody's dream. This is done in an extremely thoughtful way, and is thrilling to watch.I don't know how to really write this to get across exactly what I'm trying to say. So, I'll just write a brief little ""review"". I love the concept of the movie, and I think that the thought and imagery put into it were amazing. The plot may have not seemed extremely deep, but there was enough to make the movie worthwhile. The real treat is getting to see how a dream is put on screen. The cast is incredible, and the soundtrack is fantastic. There is nothing about this movie that I didn't like, besides the fact that it ended. I could have watched something like this forever.This is a brilliant movie, and will actually make you use your brain at the same time, which is always something that I appreciate. I saw this on the release night in IMAX, which was awesome (especially for the sound), but this can be enjoyed on any TV, any time. Do yourself a favor and check this out. You will be thoroughly impressed!",1
"This movie is excellent, David Fincher is brilliant.  Edward Norton is the greatest actor ever he really brings out the movie.  I will never get sick of this movie! *****/*****",1
"Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",1
"Awesome movie I have ever seen. I watch the movie again & again. The actors acting was wonderful. This is a great movie. This is the most popular movie in the world. It deserves the first ranking of IMDb. When I first watched the movie it was just like unbelievable. Because the story was great. For that greatest story, this movie takes place in peoples heart. May be we won't see this type of movie again. But this movie will live in our heart. Awesome movie I have ever seen. I watch the movie again & again. The actors acting was wonderful.

"There has been many films in the past that involves dreams, this picture was an actual dream not just an involvement. The idea of being able to access ones dreams which is possible today, leaves us to look further into securing them. This film is by far the most thought provokingly inter-twind feature that covers not just the ability to access dreams but to create a world within them, as well as exploring the levels of Rem, which is the deepest part of our sleep that allows us to dream. It is a one of a kind film that left me speechless. It is rear that i find a film that renders me speechless, as remarkable of a job director Christopher Nolan did when he captured the vision of creating the world that is within a dream. A brilliantly written screenplay. It was the first film with such an accurate display of truth in a fictional story line. It inspired me to begin writing the screenplay #MoscowRules as the actors and director so masterfully combined the best of their talents to bring the story line to life of what could have been a sub-par project if not for the talent that brought the writers story to life. My hope is that i can combine quality talent with brilliant directing to bring the #MoscowRules story to life and leave the audience on the edge of their seats as I was watching this movie.",1
"It's a masterpiece film that will have a value all the times. Some critics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that Shawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they are wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without being vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever losing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left feeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained. Breathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The main theme (""End Titles"" on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films. Shawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the better it becomes, really bizarre how it didn't appeal much at the time 1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that year. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being aired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have finally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was great. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it was worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. It wasn't until he meets Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with the sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn't about a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it didn't matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled: Fear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill it. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie so great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was described as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair, Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so soothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn't really needed. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene where he play a recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro on the loudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner turn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the Warden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it would be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes and messages, it's hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental pillars of human life: hope. Some critics do have a problem with the film in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn't help that 2007, two inmates of Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar techniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault, is that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was innocent of the murders, he wasn't innocent in white collar crimes. Another thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional relationship between two men. I don't see anything wrong with it, thinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it's a homosexual relationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is clear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the sisters gang, but how inmates' referral to new arrivals as ""fresh fish."" There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita Hayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a symbol for anal sex. If that's isn't weird enough, some critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people see in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I do like the 1963's 'Great Escape"" references with the socks. I don't want to spoil anything, but all I can say is, ""I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie"". Overall you build an understanding and feel for the characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets to you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put together and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to watch it at least once in their life time. Don't take my word for it. Just watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying.",1
"'Inception (2010)' is a refreshingly original film with a high-concept premise and a big-budget execution. Nolan's passion-project deals with an obscure concept that informs every aspect of the feature and leads to some visually stunning moments. The hallway fight is one of the best action sequences in recent memory, though it is quite short. While occasional exposition can feel a bit heavy-handed, the feature whisks you along for the ride at its own brisk pace and effortlessly wraps you up in its layered narrative. It truly one of the most unique and successful films of the decade, one that still caters for a wide audience while treating them as intelligent individuals. 9/10",1
"Very Good Movie, good actors, good story. Your really need to watch this, it's not a waste of time. What? Are you still reading this review? Go and watch this movie, there is comedy, action and at the end you will see some drama too and it has a lot to show. Brad Pitt played very well, Edward Norton too. So go and spend your time watching this beautiful movie.",1
"This is a movie that does not try to outsmart its viewer. It's a simple story of friendship and ""brotherhood"", of good and evil. One of the biggest things I got from this film is patience and determination. The way the lead character Andy Dufresne, put up with the ""wrongs"" throughout his life to finally be free. Traveling through 400 yards of sh*t to taste freedom speaks volumes of his lifelong battle. I cannot begin to count the times I've seen this movie. ""Shawshank"" is one of those movies that when you stumble upon it while channel surfing, you have to watch it until the end. No matter how many times I've seen it, I still weep at the ""Brooks was here"" scene and at the ending of the movie. Such a well cast movie, you grow a fondness for the characters good and bad. If I had to point out one flaw, it would be the ""Elvis"" prisoner..... but this is only a mere speck that cannot dull the shine of this outstanding movie. This is a movie that should have swept the Oscars in 1995. Between the writing and the acting performances, It's a ""no-brainer"".",1
Love the way Christian bale and Heath ledger bounce off each other they had very great acting chemistry together and made a great batman movie very Frank Miller style love the realistic storyline,1
I love this movie but the title is nice and the pictures!!!!!!!,1
"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.",1
The best film I have ever seen. It is my favourite movie.,1
"i have seen this movie at least 5 times and i have enjoyed it equally every single time!the story is really interesting and doesn't lose its red line and as a watcher you are connected to the movie. the story is like realistic (i hope you get what i mean) like it could happen in our or maybe it has already.however this movie was really enjoyable and also i loved the music. we could talk endless about the music and how good it was so i will leave it there.i watch a lot of films and since you are here in IMDb means also that you watch a lot of films by yourself but this movie is nothing like we see these days. some people (i know them) don't like or watch a movie because people talk so much about, weird huh, i know. watch this movie and you will not regret it!",1
I v seen this movie for many times. it's really fantastic!!! I wanna live in that kind of world which can develop dreams although with risk. The actresses are so gorgeous. Their performance make the movie wonderful! You totally need to see this movie! Btw Leonardo is so handsome!,1
"Fight Club is an adrenaline rush of a film.  A movie that takes you in, twists you around, tests your limits, and leaves you stunned.  It is an incredibly dark comedy, an inspired satire, and, all around, a great film.As the film opens, we are taken through the body of the Narrator (that is how he is credited, for very good reasons), until we arrive looking down the barrel of a gun jammed in his mouth.  The Narrator is played by Edward Norton, in a performance full of so much sarcasm, Kevin Spacey had better start watching his back.  Here Norton once again proves that he is one of the best actors appearing in film today.  His role is a tricky one, but he pulls it off so easily, it seems like child's play.The gun is being held by Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt, who also pulls off a tricky performance.  Pitt is a very good actor who is unfortunately cursed with sex-symbol status, and therefore, not taken too seriously. Here, though, he once again shows that he is an actor.Shortly after this, we learn that buildings throughout the city are wired to explode in minutes.  As this is explained, we are given a spectacular special effects sequence where the camera swoops down the side of the high-rise, passes through the street, into the garage of the building, through a van, and right into the explosive device.  The film uses this effect a few other times in the film, and all to good effect.With this setup, the film flashes back to when the Narrator had a bit of insomnia.  His job is tedious, the stuff in his apartment doesn't seem as nice anymore, and he goes to support groups just to sleep at night.  He has a nice thing going until another `tourist' shows up to one of his support groups.  She is Marla, played with fun and a strange sadness by Helena Bonham Carter.Now the insomnia reappears, he is traveling for work excessively, and he just happens to meet Tyler on an airplane.  They talk for a bit, and the Narrator is intrigued by him.  When he returns home, he finds that it is a pile of rubble; blown out of the building.  His decision: call Tyler.  They have a drink, he asks to stay at Tyler's place (after some convincing), and something strange happens.  Tyler asks the Narrator to hit him.  Thus, the unofficial start of Fight Club.From here, the movie centers on the club and how it is gradually knocked up levels, until we begin to realize what Tyler's philosophy really is and its effects on the Narrator and the other members.David Fincher, who has explored the dark side of human nature in Seven, directs the film in such high style that there is never a dull shot in the film.  He proves he is a visionary director, and I am sure he will have many more opportunities to bring his vision to the screen.It is not often that a film is able to capture its time so perfectly. Earlier this year,  South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was able to satirize the censorship issue.  Now comes Fight Club, a film about Generation X and corporate America that is brutally honest.  You leave the theater knowing that Tyler's actions are too extreme and anarchistic, but there is something in his words that speak to anyone who is fed up to some degree with the way our society is.  Fight Club is a film worthy of multiple viewings.  The first time, it is a visual experience.  The next time, something deeper appears.  By the third time, if you already haven't, you should see it with some of your more intelligent friends and discuss the issues the film deals with; and there are a lot.",1
"Why I like this movie? I don't know but right from the first scene it just keeps me with it and i want to watch it till end. I love everything about this film; editing, acting, direction, cinematography, sound and everything. Brad Pitt truly emerges as champion of this film when Edward Norton leaves you with open mouth. Based on a novel by Chuck Pahlunick, this movie has everything that i wanted my movie to had if i ever made one. The reason why i love this psycho thriller movie is its fast paced story movement and camera work. My favorite scene is when Norton is hugged by a fat man and inner conflicts of his mind are going in the narration, it is awesomely pictured and acted upon. You get interested in the plot with every moving second and feel like you have become a pat of their world.A must watch for every one. Truly recommended.",1
"Nollan brings us a Batman that is totally real and possible. Any thing happening in this movie is possible to happen of screen. Batman has no super powers (we all know), either do the villains. Batman is a man using technology and intelligence as a base for his skills. Every line in the movie is plausible. The casting is flawless, quite well selected in entire trilogy. Christian Bale show his chameleon skills going from Bruce to Batman as fast and certain as you can flip a coin. Tha usually romantic Aaron Eckheart, is also broken in two, and instead of switching from edges, he merge'em resulting in the only Harvey Two Face, in the cinema that could be taken seriously. Heath Leadger acting is one of the most amazing things you could see in your entire life. It makes you wonder: Jack Nicholson who? This is the kind of movie that plays on my screen every once in a while.",1
"I watched The Dark Knight in my country, Indonesia. We didn't get the ultra-hype for this movie like our friends at USA. I really want to know how this movie really is, because I read in the net that Dark Knight is one of the most anticipated movie of the year.I see the movie and I gotta say that it was great. The Dark Knight was clever, brilliant, and outstanding when we compare with another action movie. But it isn't flawless. I could say that The Dark Knight is not a masterpiece. You know a Masterpiece when you seen one. Don't get me wrong, The Dark Knight delivered a deep drama, an elegant acting (standing ovation for Heath Ledger...) but it has a lot of holes in the plot. We don't know what happen with the Joker at the end, and how Harvey Dent falling into the Dark Side. Although the death of Rachel gives the movie a high praise for not going dull (normally the death of the main girl was too corny, but in The Dark Knight Nolan made it very cool without losing the grieve)Sure, The Dark Knight is a very sophisticated movie, If you compare this movie with another superheroes movie. But I don't think this is the Best movie of the 2008...",1
"Hi guys,This is the best of the best and it is total 100% deserve to place on top 1.each and every frame of this movie is perfect, specially the character of a hero and red, this movie is based on a novel and really we don;t know where it came from all we need a good movie and i found that, this is my all time best movie ever.life gives you the worst situations but one day is yours, get ready for worst and you will get a good day too.loved it.....,",1
"Frank Darabont has created a masterpiece with this film.The entire film is based upon the principle of institutionalisation, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman playing two prisoners who over many years become good friends.From start to finish the film is gripping, moving and inspiring.I am 24 and I usually love loud action movies etc. However you can't beat films like this and I have to admit (cue cliché) they just don't make films like this anymore.This is my favourite film and I would recommend this to anyone who has not seen it yet to put it top of their watchlist.",1
"To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite Drama movie ever. It is beautifully written and the acting by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and flawless. This was my first time watching this movie and I absolutely loved it. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.I found it surprising that Andy escaped Shawshank prison. I thought that he would get parole just like Brooks did, but I was wrong. The amount of time he spent planning his escape was undeniable and fascinating. Andy never lost hope. ""Hope can make a man insane"" is a powerful quote said by Red, but was quickly contradicted by Andy who wrote in his letter for his pal Red that ""Hope is a good thing.""After 40 years in Shawshank prison, Red finally was released. He realized that he has nothing in the outside world and misses his friend Andy. However, he did not commit suicide unlike Brooks, but honored the promise he made to Andy. Andy's quote ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" stayed in Red's head and motivated him to travel to Mexico and see Andy.The iconic shot of Andy with stretched arms and closed eyes in the rain was brilliant and symbolizes freedom. After 19 years in Shawshank prison he escaped and is finally free to do whatever his heart desires.The Shawshank Redemption is empowering and leaves the audience covered in thoughts about the strong message behind the movie. The message the movie conveys is that one should never give up and always have hope.I loved how the movie referenced the book ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas. While not having the exact same plot, the Shawshank Redemption and the Count of Monte Cristo both share similar aspects. For instance, in both the movie and book the main character escapes from prison.To conclude, this is by far my all time favorite drama movie and understand why it is the top rated movie on IMDB despite being a box office disappointment. For those who have not watched it, I recommend it due to the powerful friendship between Red and Andy. The Shawshank Redemption is in many ways an all time classic movie.",1
"Many people are saying that Christopher Nolan may be the best film maker of his generation. I thoroughly enjoyed Memento, thought Batman Begins was great, thought The Dark Knight was fantastic, and after watching Inception I think the man is a cinematic genius and can't wait for his next project. But I will have lots of enjoyment watching Inception many times over until then.He supposedly honed this script for 10 years and it definitely shows. The story is quite complex and has not a plot hole in it that I was able to observe. It has everything - loss, redemption, amazing action, great character development, mind-blowing effects that serve the story and not the other way around as many films do nowadays, and at the core is a love story not too unlike Orpheus and Eurydice. But unlike the myth the underworld is a damaged soul. And when it looks like the story is wrapped up, there's a last second twist that will throw you for a loop.What the Matrix did for virtual reality - Inception does for dreams and takes it even deeper. This is a film where spoilers might ruin your sense of wonder and discovery watching this film for the first time so I won't give you any. But what I will say is that if you took What Dreams May Come, crossed it with the Matrix, Mission Impossible, and threw in a good measure of a Phillip K. Dick quality science-fiction story - you would be heading in the right direction.The hype is real. You will not be disappointed. Go see this film!",1
"i saw this movie yesterday.it was mind blowing.i went with some great expectations and this movie surpassed my expectations.the screenplay was awesome and the cast was excellent.some brilliant performances by actors like Dicaprio,levitt and Ellen page had made this movie a 2011 Oscar contender.the first half of the movie was a bit slow but the second half gained pace and was mind blowing.Nolan deserves Oscar for creating this masterpiece.am sure that this movie will be the no.1 contender for 2011 Oscars..hope this movie gets many Oscars. thanks to Nolan for giving this wonderful movie.. i give this movie a 10/10...nolan u rock.........",1
"Unbelievably excellent film, with brilliant directing, and quality acting. Every single aspect of this film is ingenious on so many levels, and everything ties together and fits in so well and it's all just so incredibly ultimately amazing. If you haven't seen this film, then do so your life won't be complete without it.",1
"Director Frank Darabont not only created the movie of the year, he created a movie of the century with stunning yet beautiful cinematography to both Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins performance that makes Shawshank Redemption is one of the best.",1
"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.",1
"This film was an obvious labor of love on the part of director David Fincher and stars Ed Norton and Brad Pitt. Fincher is among the great directors of his generation, with a distinct style that really fits the core of this film. I've heard it said that he directs movies ""you can smell"" and the world of Fight Club reeks. Norton and Pitt were very involved with finding props and creating small moments that further drive the film's main themes across. Both insisted that their characters destroy a Volkswagen Beetle saying ""It's a perfect example of the Baby Boomer generation marketing its youth culture to us. As if our happiness is going to come by buying the symbol of their youth movement"" . It's clear that they felt the film's message of this lost generation was very important. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/03/15/fight-club/",1
"if you haven't seen this already...go right now and watch it and this is as desperate and imp as Gandalf put it best"" Run you fools"". This movie is truly enjoyed when you absolutely have no idea of the plot and I know then why would one watch it but this is just like with its continuously changing plots.. I loved it and it definitely gives you that kick when you are feeling low in life...Wow I truly loved it and I watched this with my best friends. Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in defending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy tale. But ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has its own brand of iconoclasm, with Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as Andy is himself.",1
I Thought To Myself At First When I First viewed this movie it wasn't at all going to be any worser than most movies i've seen. But I was wrong. It's the best adapted movie of all time and I think I ought say it's the best movie I've ever seen since The Dark Knight. I haven't seen The Godfather Francise Yet but don't really want to now that I've seen The Shawshank Redemption the very best movie and the top of my favorite movie lists. It's powerful and jaw-dropping and can get very emotional at times and the best thing about this film is Tim Robins the best actor of all time and Morgan Freeman clearly the main character of the film. The bad guys are the captain of the guards Mr Hatley I remember and Norton the Worton the biggest assholes I've seen in a movie that can drive you insane. And also Brookes and the guy with the beard around his cheeks can't remember his name they were good too. Best Movie of all time period 10/10,1
"Fight Club is an excellent movie, just saw it yesterday for like the 15th time and loved every minute of it. It just never ages. Fight Club would be always known for its quotes. I loved all of them. Now coming to my point, I think every special line or quote from fight club had that added 'touch' with it. This means that whenever a quote or an excellent line is delivered, there is something about it that's not clichéd. This could be an uncommon gesture given by the actors (the way Brad Pitt looks really cool after most of the memorable lines he delivers), the addition of playback music (for instance, the wacky music that starts when Edward Norton says ""that really hurt, hit me again""), complete silence (e.g., when Helena Carter says ""My God. I haven't been fucked like that since grade school.""), crisp editing that starts with another scene totally not related to previous one only to make you wonder about what just happened (for example, the narrator says ""Tyler was now involved in a class action lawsuit against the Pressman Hotel over the urine content of their soup."" and this has no relation with what happens next). There were few quotes though, that when the movie is seen for the first time, can go easily unnoticed. My favorite of these 'unnoticeable quotes' is when Brad Pitt gets up from the airplane seat next to Edward Norton and says ""Now a question of etiquette; as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch...?"". Every other line has a philosophical attachment towards it and is linked to the main theme of the movie, but this quote just comes out of nowhere and goes unnoticed. It certainly is my favorite quote. Do you guys agree? Think about it this way, if it wasn't in the script, it would've made no difference, but they purposely put it in. It made its way in because it deserved to be there. Looking forward to comments from you all regarding this.",1
"An interesting way to portray futuristic lucid dreaming technology.The movie would have been more enjoyable if it focuses more on the dialogs than the blockbuster action. We've seen the effects before, so there's really nothing much new as compared to the Matrix when slow bullets first came in.Since the idea of lucid dreaming is still new and fresh to most people, not many people would actually understand the depth of this movie.And what i didn't understand was, why couldn't the dreamer dream of better weapons? OR wear a bulletproof vest etc.? If the dreamer could dream of such complicated architecture, wouldn't that also mean he/she could dream of the people in it? Since in dreams, buildings and humans are the same, they are emotionless and formless. Only the dreamer feels it and have the power to tailor it.Everyone would love the idea of living a life in a dream to wake up still young. And i believe that this is true! It's a matter of how much you can remember from the dream after awoken. It's said that 90% of dreams are lost within 5 mins after awoke.Limbo just did not make sense in the movie. How one arrive and get out, is a little complex. And really, one could wake up with the memory lost from a dream? The movie is not exactly mind blowing since we have already seen similar pieces of work but it's still good and refreshing once in a while rather than those no brain teaser movie, iron man etc.I guess the most intriguing is Nolan's conclusion of the movie is that we will never find out if Cobb is dreaming and neither will he. Still, thumbs up and worth watching.Other better similar movies to recommend: Vanilla Sky, Waking life, The Matrix.",1
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.",1
"This movie is much more than a comic book film. It's not a perfect comic book movie, it's simply almost a perfect movie. Christopher Nolan is not your average filmmaker. Christopher Nolan is simply a genius.",1
One of the best movies ever. That simple. It's pretty long but it holds your attention and you won't notice. Brilliant.,1
"I hope if this fails getting an Academy Awards nomination it wins the Saturn Award for best picture. It's pleasantly confusing and the ""dream team"" acts adult level and professional. There's too many sci-fi films were researcher heroes supposed to be colleagues working together but I can't believe it for the lack of discipline. Thank God there's no love interest side story that takes attention from the rest of the goings one. It instead adds deeper sense of tragedy.I was sucked into this world and 20 minutes in I didn't know where the dreams began or the whole thing was a dream. It reminded me of the twilight zone that the dream technology was refined into an art.I loved Leonardo Di Capro in this, torn by guilt, but staunch on getting the job and why he wants to succeed.",1
I am still blown away by Heath Ledger's performance. Hands down the best villain of this era. Christopher Nolan can still do no wrong in my opinion. I feel like Chicago was the perfect setting for the tone and setting of this film. Great Cinematography and action through out. I'm curious if the joker's character arc would have sustained into the third film had heath ledger no passed on. Sadly we will never know. Aaron Eckhart as two face was brilliant. I love how his character developed from good to evil throughout the film. I wish Katie Holmes would have stayed on for the project. Maggie Gyllenhaal was not believable and having that sort of character change hurts the film.,1
"Stephen King's books have a distinctive voice - warm, sincere, inviting - that probably accounts for the appeal of his fiction just as much as his macabre imagination.Yet none of the many movies adapted from King's work have managed to capture his singular, light, immediately recognizable tone.Until now, that is: ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" a first feature written and directed by Frank Darabont, finds the perfect cinematic equivalent to King's style. Based on the nonhorror novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" this is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.Like much of King's work, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is about an exceptional individual at odds with society, picked on or persecuted for the gifts that set him apart. In this case, the gift isn't supernatural, like Carrie's telekinetic powers, but moral and spiritual.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a gangly young banker when he enters Maine's fortresslike Shawshank State Prison in 1946, accused of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover. Though his protestations of innocence don't carry much weight, his shy manner and decency does. Befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran con who is the prison fixer, he soon draws a circle of other boyishly likable prisoners around him, including William Sadler as a sweet-tempered thug and James Whitmore as a cuddly old man who is the prison librarian.Like ""Forrest Gump,"" to which ""Shawshank"" bears a coincidental but commercially convenient resemblance, this is a story of saintly endurance. Though Andy is abused by a prison bully who rapes him, a brutal guard who beats him and a crafty warden who uses Andy's banking skills to launder the vast amounts of cash he's siphoning off the system, Andy's patience, tolerance and selfless concern for his fellow man see him through.The poster girl on his cell wall turns from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Raquel Welch, before providence rewards him with an opportunity to get some of his own back.Those poster girls remain pretty much the only female presence in this snug, all-male environment, where the warm camaraderie suggests less a prison than a boys' club on an epic scale. So sweetly juvenile is the film's perspective that it comes as a shock to realize, in the final act, that King's story is at heart an elaborate revenge fantasy.In a film that stands or falls on the central character's amiability, Tim Robbins is loose and effective, though the real performance here is from Morgan Freeman, whose projected affection for his friend really determines how we feel about him. Darabont's direction is precise and assured, without being terribly imaginative.",1
"Fight club is not about fighting. It's about violence, commercialism, reality, and so many other things. It's about anarchy, disorder, and, yes, even soap. The movie works on so many levels. There isn't a second in this movie where I was bored. Some movies have weak spots or a scene that takes away from the film. Fight club doesn't suffer from that. Every character, every line of dialogue, and every scene in the movie is so interesting and clever. The performances are awesome, David Fincher does an amazing job as well (can't wait for his next). A great movie that is about more than just fighting and violence and yet revolves entirely around those two things. 9/10",1
"One of the best films that I have watched, so completely enticing! It had me in tears at the end, such an emotional film.. So glad that it was made, the screen-writers/directors/producers should all be so proud of themselves, the film is so amazing and if only I was a few years older.. I'd have loved to have been a part of it. So interesting and catchy, once I'd started to watch I couldn't stop!! Although parts of it did drag slightly, they recovered extremely well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. Morgan Freeman is such an amazing actor, I couldn't imagine anyone else to play the role of Red it was done so well. Tim Robbin's was also well cast. Well done.",1
Don't waste your time reading this review and go watch the movie,1
"Not too sure what all the fuss is about Nolan has directed far better movies.How this can be rated in the top 10 of the 'Top 250' index only demonstrates the flaws of the IMDb rating system as much as it does to the rationale behind general movie-goers.The idea of a dream within a dream, or lucid dreams, or memories, has been touched on and seen in other films. Vanilla Sky is a perfect example, which is actually a much better film overall. The acting is more powerful and you begin to develop a strong connection with the characters throughout the movie, unlike in Inception which is rather more focused on plot.Inception...well, I wish it really were a dream.",1
"I have long considered Hans Zimmer an underutilized soundtrack composer, because, until now, his talent has not been given full rein to move the viewing audience to the emotional depths of which he is capable.Inception unleashes that ability, in much the way the character of Dom seeks a supremely talented ""dream architect."" Nowhere is this more evident than when Zimmer's score plays during the closing few sequences, with no dialogue. These minutes are, in my mind, a demonstration of the ideal application of music in film, and I loudly applaud the filmmakers for this decision to let emotion, riding on the powerful waves of music, finish the story. After all, many of us are not stupid, and we know what is happening without constant verbal exposition. Having seen Inception several times now, I still sob uncontrollably during this extremely powerful ending. That speaks volumes when one knows it is far more common for me to be sneeringly sarcastic by the end of a movie.As delightful as this is, however, it is, I am pleased to say, only a portion of what makes this movie work for a rather wide audience. First and foremost, the script tells a story that gives viewers of different experiences and age groups different things to think about. On the surface, it has its fair share of action and shoot-em-up scenes. But ultimately, for more mature viewers, the film has a lot to say about interpersonal interaction, and the ultimate place of relationship in reality, as opposed to the virtual kind (whether in dream states or on Facebook and other social media). In this sense, Christopher Nolan has clearly matured as a writer and director.Then there is the acting. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an excellent performance. Like Nolan, DiCaprio has matured, and as he has, he became an authentic actor, not just a ""star."" The genius of this film with regard to the acting, however, is the sparse use of big names, and the copious addition of incredibly talented character actors -- those people whose names may not be household words, but who pack an unrivaled punch of talent. After all, shouldn't a truly good actor actually cause us to ""know"" different characters in different films, and not their individual persona over and over again? This is Inception's serious fodder, and why so many of the film's actors are multiple Oscar nominees, even if not common names in People Magazine. There is also the intelligent use of special effects. Unlike so many modern films, the CG departments here didn't waste their talents with clichéd scenes of actors in slow motion martial arts moves, instead opting for judicious enhancement of the visual texture of the film. It is appropriate special effects, not merely CG for the sake of CG. The appeal of classic films, for so many thinking film connoisseurs, is the way a well-executed script will take root in your mind and haul you along into the magnificent journey of a unique tale. With the advent of modern technology pandering to nanosecond attention spans, too many filmmakers have lost the ability (or willingness) to relate a good story visually, relying instead on mere ""eye candy"". While special effects can wow an audience, just because we can do something doesn't mean we should. Inception gets this idea (this and the prior reference intended, which is understood once the movie is seen) and applies it exceedingly well. I will admit I almost gave up on this movie half way through the first viewing. By the end I was beyond relieved I had not. Somewhere along the way this movie grabbed hold and wouldn't let me go. It turned out to be one of those films that one thinks about for hours after watching, and, like a good classic, has me returning again and again to catch the subtle ways in which the story unfolds scene to scene -- dialogue and visuals which may not be noticed until all is revealed. I've now watched it three times in less than a month. I've not watched even Casablanca that frequently. So if Inception seems silly or trite upon your first viewing, I implore you to hang in there. If you value good stories and thought-provoking, suspenseful tales, I predict you'll change your mind before the end. The second viewing is even better, now that you know what is going on early in the film. In fact, unlike many lesser films, I have only one serious quarrel with this movie, and it is relatively minor. It occurs early on, when DiCaprio's character says to Ellen Page's character, in the middle of a sentence, that ""they say we only use a small percentage of our brains..."" Science has thoroughly debunked this particular bit of nonsense, and I sincerely wish the spread of this myth would stop. Given the terribly bad opinion I have held of most films made since about the early 60's, this is such a minor error that I almost forgive myth-spreading. This film is a minimum TWO-TIME must see, as it offers some new interesting morsel of thought each time around. It is what good cinema should be -- a fascinating tale well told in every way.",1
"One of the few movies I have purchased without watching and at the end I was definitely satisfied with my purchase.Christopher Nolan has churned out a thoroughly engaging and original thriller that lived up to it's hype of being a thinking-person's movie. Not that you need an encyclopedia to guide you but I would recommend pausing if getting up for a coffee so you miss nothing. The script guides the audience through the action using fluent logic so as to (thankfully) not allow any indulgence into any confusion that the tricky concept could have easily slipped into.The movie has a surprisingly happy ending that has been well and truly over-analysed by the folk on the boards. Suffice it to say that 5 minutes thinking and a dose of Occam's Razor should allow one to decipher what the ending is truly telling us about the protagonist.I don't include plot summaries in my reviews, they are readily found on the page. I would like to mention the acting and characterisation is almost perfect. Almost in that Nolan could have stretched Leo even further. Saying that, I got the feeling that some of the scenes were done in one take since the filmmakers had only one crack at getting the special effects right. If this was the case, it is the movie's only flaw.",1
"I have never seen a perfect movie, and did not know there could be such a thing. But this is it. I have always been a Batman fan. But this was so much more than a comic book movie. It was an epic. Even if had nothing to do with the character we know and love, it would still have an excellent story. It's suspenseful, funny, terrifying, heartwarming. It literally has everything you could want from a movie. And it seems REAL. The Batmobile didn't look like a bat, it looked like a tank, able to withstand anything. Plus it held the Batpod. How awesome was that? And the Joker! Heath Ledger, may he rest in peace, did absolutely some of the best acting I have ever, ever seen. He WAS the Joker. Not some cheesy bad guy. He was a REAL psychopath. He was both hilarious and terrifying. And his objective was to cause chaos. Not greed. Just to wreak havoc on Gotham City, and especially on Batman. And the whole story is phenomenal. It's over two and a half hours long, yet it doesn't seem like it at all. You never want it to end. It starts with a bang and never slows down. And the armored car chase? Easily the best car chase ever put on film. I watched this movie three times in the theater. I've never done that. And I LOVE movies. Great story, great REAL effects (the only CGI in the entire movie was Two-Face, and I'm glad Christopher Nolan did that right and not Like Tommy Lee Jones), and the acting - top notch across the board. I can't wait to see how how Nolan tops this, because you know he will this. I can't believe it didn't even get a nod for best picture. A shame. At least Ledger won. He deserved every bit of the hype. He and Nolan both went above and beyond all expectations.",1
"This film was by far one of the best action/superhero films ever created. The character of Batman in this film is without question the best superhero portrayed in any past marvel films. The plot has an excellent storyline that keeps you on edge from the first to last minute, and all the characters are well played and very believable. Also, the special effects of this film are outrageously stunning and breathtaking throughout the entire movie. Furthermore, Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar for his outstanding, incredible performance as the Joker, the best villain in any movie thus far created. This film is without doubt a must see that you will fall in love with the moment you watch it!!!!!",1
"Maybe The No. 1 On My Top Movi's List ^_^
Heath Ledger (The Joker) Is Defiantly outstanding, he preformed like no other, really loved his role.
I mean he definitely deserved the Oscar!
Such a talented fella <3
Such A Lost 4 Hollywood :(
And I Don't Think That There's Someone Who Could Fill The gap he Left ...
Finally Great Achievements In Cinematography And Great achievements From The Nolan's Brothers (Specially Christopher) ^_^",1
"The theme of the movie was interesting, yet not well executed. Too long, plotholes, confusing and much luck just to work every little detail-not realistic. For such important mission, team should be more professional and meticulous. Still, enjoyed the movie and I could definitely rewatch it.",1

Heath Ledger's (Joker) performance is legendary",1
"The movie, Fight Club is an artwork masterpiece full of theatrical tricks and effects. It engages the watcher with nonlinear story that moves faster than the speed of a thought. It deals with modern issues of society and ages very well. It has an unbeatable plot and great acting. Fight Club has the watcher flinching constantly and it is amazing how this holds true. It is not surprising at all how this movie is still considered good 17 years later. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton fit their roles perfectly. The narrative infuses the author's voice into the movie and the character. If you enjoy great movies you will enjoy this one.",1
"Noticing how this movie comes up many times in discussions I have with friends, I feel I have to express my admiration. There's really so many things that's good here: plot, humor, acting, style, cast, camera, speed. Too much to be told in a small review... So I'll zoom in on some personal highlights. One amazing thing is that the movie is so rich: it contains so many interesting scenes and ideas. Another is the combination of a both dark and very funny atmosphere. A last 'detail' that is quite subjective: I love the way the alternative scene is portrayed. (The Pixies' best number is used on the best moment.) The criticism on society is no preaching here, but more like a nostalgic monument. This movie made David Fincher one of my favorite directors.",1
"You cannot surpass that kind of forward leap. Historically it constitutes a mark, then you may say, after Inception only a few relevant pieces are there to show. There are undervalued movies like the recent Mortal Engines that lack innovation on a level but offer beautiful takes and effects. But the masterpiece has a deep, intricate, understandable, coherent line of development from start to end. Maybe there are questions unanswered, maybe it is a common place regarding the children, but the ensemble is highly positioned among its pairs. Good arquitecture!",1
"Best movie, you can watch it again and again.
Beggining few minutes are just the plot, real thriller starts from fight club. Movie is insane , strange, humorous. When things get out of control thats where the real fun begins.
Extraordinary ending.
Its Like shutter Island or machinist .
But every one should watch it.",1
"I completely understand those who gave a perfect 10. But I am not necessarily one of them, am I? One simple question: well, what does Nolan exactly want to say? It is not so much related to ""dreams"", seemed to me, rather, it is about our natural ability to embrace or evade the good, the bad, and the ultimate void of our existence.Through dreams, it just became easier to explain. However, when you cool down the mind blown by the imaginative scenes and cuts and lines, you shall ask yourself, ""do I have to have a three-level dream to confront and finally evade the haunting late wife?"" The answer might be yes, so you will give a 10. And the answer could be no, so the score will be 8, like what I gave.In one word, the movie is just too complicated for a purpose that easy.Maybe because I have seen ""Paprika"", a Japanese animated feature directed by Satoshi, Kon, the late famous Japanese animation director. He created a story that, seen by now, is a perfect basis on which Nolan drafted his. I am not saying who is stealing whose ideas of what, but I am implying (very clearly) that technically, Nolan is being derivative.One ""problem"", I might call it that way, is the deliberately prolonged fighting scene before the vehicle touched the water. Yes, I understand that makes sense of the relativity theory, yet, it is just too long for a movie.If you have a critic's eyes, you shall admit that the art direction, the cinematography, the original score, the sound and visual effects and the editing are just wonderful, if not state-of-the art. Yet, these cannot defy the facts that once again, it is just a movie about a troubled man with a troubling wife whose troubles will not be solved if one or both of them choose to disappear or stay far away from each other...If you replace the word ""wife"" with the words that I mentioned in the second paragraph, especially the negative ones, you will get what this movie is actually talking about...Take or leave it.",1
"Dom Cobb is a man filled with guilt, regret, and forced to confront the ghosts of his past. Cobb retreats into his memories and fantasies to escape the guilt that pervades him. He has alienated himself from the people in his life that he loves - all that's left are the memories. In Sergio Leone's mobster epic Once Upon a Time in America, David ""Noodles"" Aaronson has the same arc. After getting his lifelong friends killed and driving a wedge between himself and the only woman he's ever loved, he passes out in an opium den and drifts off into a drug-induced fever dream that alleviates him of any wrongdoing. The key distinction between Noodles and Cobb is subtlety. Everything revealed about the Dom Cobb character is done so thorough exposition. There's a scene in Inception where Cobb relives moments shared with his late wife and small children. We are told early on that architects are not to design dreams from memories - to only use small details - never the whole area. ""They're memories,"" remarks Ariadne. That much is obvious. ""You said never to use memories."" That, too. Nolan's superiority complex seems to bog down his movies, especially this one. With the incessant exposition, you'd expect the plot to be very intricate and esoteric - but to any 10-year-old exultant to be watching a PG:13 movie, it's quite simple. Thematically, surely there must be some depth. Well, no. The only character that doesn't exist merely as a device to further the plot and give out information is Cobb. Cobb is the only character with any semblance of depth. Cobb is the only character Nolan makes any attempt to flesh out. Cobb is the only character with any characteristics. And yet there is no subtlety. Through heavy-handed, expository dialogue, we learn all there is to possibly get out of the character. Admittedly impressive practical effects can only go so far. If you want an entertaining popcorn flick to pass time, look no further. But if you're in the mood for a challenging film that will stimulate your brain and linger on your mind until you've dissected every frame, Inception isn't for you.Inception isn't complex. Not in its plot and certainly not its themes, but one moment in the film has led to confusion amongst viewers. That moment, of course, happens in the last two seconds. Because the film is sostagnant, the first time that I watched Inception, I simply didn't care whether or not the ending was a dream. I thought, 'Well, the kids are wearing the same clothes and appear to be about the same age - it must be a dream.' According to Nolan, that is not the case. Regardless, though, what actually are the implications of the scene taking place in reality? Well, since the kids haven't aged much, what little of an impact was left dwindles even further. He's been gone for what - two months? Cobb's relationship with Mal has some interesting ideas, but his dynamic with his children extends to 'he loves his children very much.' That's it. He loves his children and can finally see them. Oh, but I'm not getting it - Nolan is Cobb and his alienation from his children is reflecting on the director's devotion to his work and subsequent time away from the home - during a crucial period of development where they need him the most. But all of that is incredibly obvious from just watching the movie. It doesn't take years of marinating for that conclusion to be drawn.Restraint in a director is commendable. That's why Denis Villeneuve's Enemy and the recent I'm Thinking of Ending Things are so effective. What could easily be these grand reveals that call attention to themselves are instead left symbolic and ambiguous. They reward the viewer for thinking about the movie. Inception has not one, but two twists: one, Cobb is responsible for his wife's death; two, Cobb performed inception on her, ultimately leading to said death. Inception isn't a film that rewards the viewer for thinking about it for a prolonged period of time; you enjoy it while it lasts, but it isn't substantive enough to remain in your mind for five minutes before you realize there's nothing here that hasn't been done before much better.",1

"I have just returned from watching THE DARK KNIGHT, which is in the last week of a six-week engagement at the Coliseum near where I live. I purposely watched the movie to honor Heath Ledger, which I said I would do in an earlier post that seems to have been rejected - the first posting ever made about this movie, in fact. Ledger was a talented man who would have made many more movies if he had lived. The movie was totally bizarre, but the plot was well-structured and Heath gave a convincing performance as the mad Clown of Crime, a scarred madman who is hired by Gotham City's mobsters to destroy the Batman and bring down Harvey Dent, the city's visible public crusader.",1
"I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in this film until a friend of mine started raving about it.  Then it came on TV so I thought I might as well have a look, but nothing prepared me for what I saw.I was expecting a dumb film about grown men hitting each other a lot.  I was not expecting such a dark, psychological drama with such intelligence, wit and an ending to make it all seem worthwhile.I haven't seen a film that has kept me awake at night for some time now, but this one did that and more.Good acting, direction and all that kind of thing, but most importantly, what an inspired script.",1
"This movie, considered by many as the best of all time, got my attention as well. Of course, I previously had expectations that Nolan couldn't possibly ruin this and would offer us a believable and interesting story instead. I was not wrong. The story was deep, with well-developed characters who have multiple dimensions, everyone having their virtues, but also many flaws as well. What raised my grades in this movie, was definitely Heath Ledger's impeccable and unique to such extent that The Joker has been given a whole new definition. It is an unspeakable shame that Ledger is no longer alive, as he would have probably make big time if he had still been. Nevertheless, acting alone cannot save the movie. There was also brilliant cinematography. There were some scenes where it was hard to believe little to no CGI was used during filming. I also regret not seeing this in cinemas because I think it would be one of the best cinematic experiences, and if would feel quite realistic (it felt realistic without it actually). Overall, however, I find the whole story slightly overrated to be positioned as the 4th movie of all time, mainly because there were some plot holes (or at least I missed something) that I couldn't quite explain to myself, and generally I didn't feel as if I was watching the best movie of all time. Anyway, if you haven't seen it yet, it is highly recommended, as it's already made history in many ways, and will be talked about many generations later.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers",1
"I don't understand why some people don't like this movie. No, no. Let me rephrase that. I cannot understand how some people don't like this movie. It's incomprehensible. This was a stroke of genius, and so was the book, by Chuck Palahniuk. In fact, the book was much better than the movie, but the movie was still really good. Reading the book only after having seen David Fitcher's base, I can only say that it has not ruined it for me AT ALL. The book gives a different insight and by God, if you don't like this movie, I'd have to guess you have no philosophy or morals or values you live by, which would pretty much make you... an animal? :P""Look! Two women f***ing a polar bear!"" Hunter S. Thompson",1
"The first time I watched this flick is when I'm in my junior high. My thought are what an amazing film this is. Ten years later in my College I watched this again and I'm in the awestruck, how come such a splendid craftsmanship bring so much joy to my life. After the first watched now 17 years later I watched it with my pregnant wife. And she's had the same reaction like when I'm in Junior high. Times goes by, but this film is sit still the Thorne of awesomeness.",1
"Nolan is a wonderful craftsman obsessed with dreams and the nature of reality. From Memento and Insomnia, ""What is real?"" has been a central question in his films. DiCaprio is a wonderful craftsman. The production values in this film were outstanding.The storyline was weak. The ""original"" metaphors and ideas had appeared before in the Matrix Sequels, Angel Heart, and Blade Runner. Was not disappointed but do not think is a generationally great or life-changing film. Both Nolan and DiCaprio tried really really hard and made one of the best films of the year. Anyone who thinks this film was game changing apparently hasn't seen enough films to know what game-changing is.",1

"IMDb has asked me to complete my profile by writing a review. So this is me writing a review of The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever made. This is because it incorporates many great aspects of different genres of film neatly hidden away under the superhero persona. This is not Avengers flying around in space over new york or Star Wars blazing in space in galaxies far far way. No, this is 2 men with 2 very different viewpoints trying to gain control of the city they inhabit. This is a gang war where the underdog is the villain trying to cause chaos yet still control the streets while the hero is the mob boss that controls the streets trying to keep them controlled from said chaos. All performances are top notch, if you haven't seen this film yet then what are you waiting for?",1
"Movie _ InceptionTo watch and feel the Inception movie ??. Here's my tip - Watch the days last show and then go to sleep, u'll definitely wake up two or three times to check whether u r are dreaming or not(u can even use a spinning top to check whether u r dreaming or not _ as used by Mr.Cob in the movie) . Sorry guys, but that is the hangover u take with u after watching the movie.OK !??? Let's start the review. Why did I went to watch this movie _ 1. It's written by C. Nolan and guess what, he also is the director of this movie. 2. The story of dream invasion,it's not easy to make a film on this subject. 3. The cast made it more appeal-able. 4. New (fresh new) special effect scenes.Highlighting point of the movie _ 1.It is a story about dream invasion, where the characters goes into the dream of Jr. Fischer and wants to implant a new IDEA , which is not easy ,as the new IDEA will not be accepted by Jr. Fischer (or any person) because its somebody Else's thought or an IDEA. 2. So, to make it possible, they have a plan. And it is the execution of this plan which is shown in the movie. 3. To be very honest, it's not a fairy tale story or a fantasy kind of movie/story. 4. The technical aspects of this movie are immaculate, because every action had its true reaction. The use of Science (Physics) used in this movie is awesome.5. The story is very real in its hypothesis, For e.g. _ a) If the Van is falling from a bridge into the water in 1 min (in the 1st dream), then it will wake up the guys in 10 mins in the 2nd layer of their dream and 30 mins for the guys in the 3nd layer of the dream ? and many more examples which is kept very realistic. About the director _Standing ovation for Mr. Christopher Nolan. 1. For writing this movie/story. 2. To make or direct a movie exactly as it is written.3.Even though the story is very complicated, Nolan helped us to understand this movie. You can feel his efforts, and he did everything to make this movie understandable. In fact Inception is much easy to understand than Memento.4. He has done a fine job in maintain the pace and suspense. There isn't any dull moment in the movie. 5. Special effects were new??. Look out for Joseph Gordon-Levitt fight.Performances _ 1. Leonardo is the star of this movie2. Tom Hardy(Handsome Bob ) is the second in the performance3. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the stylish and sexy. Summary _ I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if the film is good. So, sorry ?No clues Just watch the days last show and then go to sleep, u'll definitely wake up two or three times to check whether u r are dreaming or not(u can even use a spinning top to check whether u r dreaming or not _ as used by Mr.Cob in the movie)",1
"Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking ""but that wouldn't happen"".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum.",1
"I have watched this film many times and I never feel bored. It is a kind of film that make you feel that human has the potential to go through all kinds of suffering. It makes you feel the strength within human spirit and hope that never dies. After you see what the main character did, you come and look at your life and find that it is not that hard, we can keep on trying a little more. Impossible things can be possible. Spirit doesn't have to be broken by cruelty or hardship.When I watched it, I would think ""look at him, for all those years of being imprisoned without doing wrong, for all those times of going through evil people that treat him harshly, this man never gives up fighting, never give up hoping and trying to find his freedom, and he made it, and his strength even brought back the life and hope of another person"" Then, I would think...why don't I be more patient and keep trying with my life, keep trying for my dream. Just do it again and again, and one day I will get to where I want to be.Excellent film in every element of it. It's exciting, touching, and moving. Highly recommended for all who have not watched. It's a must-see for everyone.",1
"It's one of the most outstanding adaptations from a novel, an epic anti- hero film, this film possess an unbreakable and harmonic cast, Pitt, Norton, Bonham-Carter develops a marvelous acting including the secondary cast, the story it's absolutely unforgettable and full of brilliant gags, reflections, it brings a close view over a society in a madness, consuming customs, identity crisis, spiritual emptiness, self- discovering... aesthetically on art direction, costumes, cinematography and it eloquent, gets a intrepid and smart film editing that makes this film awakes on us an intermittent shock of feelings, meditations about our lives, about our directions, our relationships with our environment, society and personal.Long life to mischief, mayhem and soap.",1
"There is a pantheon of movies that define a generation. Star Wars, The Godfather, Jaws and now, The Dark Knight. A cinematic masterpiece, the films 2 and a half hours are both too short, yet so immersing it seems like days. Not one frame of wasted celluloid was included. The cinematography was unbelievable with sweeping cityscapes and intense, explosive action sequences. The acting was also unbelievable; Between Heath Ledger's tour de force (which is definitely deserving of the Oscar buzz), Aaron Eckhart's tragic Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Gary Oldman's ever brilliant presence as Lt. James Gordan, and Christian Bale's intense and driven Batman/Bruce Wayne, everyone involved is absolutely stellar. However, what truly makes this film the cinematic event that it is, is the story. Truly epic in it's scope but always aware that personal tragedy is what drives it. This is a rare cinematic masterpiece in a time where summer movies have come to mean mindless fluff, this transcends the typical superhero movie to achieve something truly spectacular. Seeing this film was an experience that I will not soon forget and I truly hope others derive the same pleasure from seeing it that I did.",1
"I saw it this weekend and I think the entire first hour was filled with anticipation as I watched things begin to unfold. The clearest reason I can give for that is because I was definitely enjoying it already, and since I knew there was much more to come I could only hope that the movie kept up the pacing and tension, I wasn't let down either. The ending was much better than the previous Batman movie too for me, there's much much more tension to it than just a near miss on ""guy gets girl"". This one also had less mystical overtones and more relevant social commentary with the portrayal of Harvey Dent as a great political hope for Gotham...******SPOILER******** Also, Bruce Wayne's use of technology to tap several million cell phones, and Morgan Freeman/Lucius Fox's response to that was an EXCELLENT poke in the eye of the current administration's policies (imo), especially in light of the most recent FISA bill.The contrast between the White Knight and the Dark Knight was well done, especially in light of the fact that these are purely iconic symbols that don't actually reflect the person that embodies each symbol. In the earlier scene where Harvey Dent was threatening the schizophrenic and Bruce showed up to tell him that the people couldn't have their One True Hope be seen like that was excellent foreshadowing and painted Dent's willingness to give way to psychopathic behavior quite well.Harvey Dent's characterization of Two Face was great, though that aspect of the story was much smaller than the overarching Joker storyline. I personally like the gritty realism that his character had so much better than earlier portrayals of him as just some comical side-kick. The use of the two-headed coin as a symbol of Rachel's death and his newfound two-faced persona played out nicely.The focus of the emotional tole on Christian Bale didn't come out as well as it possibly could have, but there is room for that in future movies. ******/SPOILER********Incidentally I'm not sure I can recall the last movie to have a score that high on IMDb after 45,000 votes. Usually movies start out with high scores (obviously due to studio's gaming the IMDb voting system at movie release) but after a few thousand the initial attempts at swaying a score are more normalized. People seem to have enjoyed this one, and it's definitely worth it. Very happy at the length of the movie too though I did notice that some people were squirming shortly before the 2 hour mark.",1
"Being a movie fan such as myself, I am always hard-pressed to answer when asked to name my top five or ten favorite movies. This movie is always one of the first ones out of my mouth.Some have complained about the violence and possible suggestion becoming a terrorist is okay, but they are missing the point. This movie is about defining yourself in your terms rather than letting others do it for you. The fighting is about making you focus on what's real, much like when Tyler swerves in front of a truck. With the prospect of your own mortality facing you, you realize what truly matters and what does not.With such a powerful message delivered in such an unconventional way, I am still amazed it got made, but I am glad it did. This is by far one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen. If you have yet to see this film, by all means see it AS SOON AS YOU CAN. The time you spend watching it will be some of the most well spent in your entire life.",1
"For my first review I have decided to review my favorite movie of all time, Fight Club.This blockbuster starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt entails a man known simply as the 'narrator' that hopes and dreams for a better life, if not then he is slowly planning his own suicide in his head, thus meeting Tyler Durden, a man the narrator aspires to be, the two of them begin 'Fight Club' where men have the satisfaction of beating the heck out of each other which for some odd reason gives them a sense of relief and purpose. Throughout the movie you begin to learn that Tyler is manipulating the system to create an underground force to attack the major financial points in the world to bring the world back to zero.This would have to be a career best for both Norton and Pitt. The intricacy that both characters portray is confusing at times as situations begin to take place where Maria, portrayed brilliantly by Helena Bonham Carter, is in a gray area with the narrator, as sometimes she hates him and sometimes she loves him. The big twist at the end of the film is that Tyler is actually an unconventional character that the narrator is imagining, the narrator wanted a better life so badly that he has imagined a voice and a guidance to help him start his new life of action.The growth of the narrator is truly a blessing to watch as he begins as a coward in life, outside a bar not wanting to punch Tyler in the face, but ends up in the film bashing Angel's face in, one of the darkest and most confusing parts of the film in my opinion. The narrator even comes to a stage where he is being interrogated by police, but without even himself knowing he has manipulated the police officers to kill him if he said any word about the operation.After each watch of the film the intricacy of the film grows but at the same time becomes simpler, each new viewing adds a new dimension that you are questioning to yourself why you didn't pick up on that in the last viewing. It is a phenomenal take on the world as it continually likes to point out how humans are inferior and how each one of us just makes up a pointless system.The movie has brilliant twist and turns that is like a puzzle, bits and pieces are forming everywhere, but when all put together, you understand the big picture. This movie makes a terrific drama film that must be watched. If you have not watched this film, this is a MUST WATCH for any film lover.That being said I give Fight Club a 9.2/10To end this review I must mention the first rule about fight club, DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUBQuite side note, I will barely ever be giving a movie over a 9, let alone a 10. Movies are never perfect, they may be perfect in your eyes, but a movie always has flaws.",1
"Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.",1
"In Inception, one can build the world by imagination. It seems to be easy to create one's dream. At the very beginning, Dom Copp see inserting an idea in one's minds deeply as no hard task. Actually, the following hardships are all due to his weakness in facing Mal. Dom Copp seems to be able to control all the situations. In fact, he cannot event create his own dream. Though the plot seems to tell us it's easy to conquer our deep fear by changing our dream, its ending indicates that our subconscious overpowers all human minds. In fact, I don't think that what Dom Copp wants to be inserted into is subconscious-- it's just a belief. Subconscious is mighty. It cannot be called subconscious if we can alter it in such an simple way.",1
"This is a film that can please anyone of any taste. Put in simple terms, this is a movie I highly recommend. It has a cast that works so naturally well together and not for one moment does the acting feel artificial or forced. I can not speak highly enough for this film.",1
It is movie that inspires me always.The best movie i have ever seen.,1
"Generally I don't write reviews to any movies. Because I'm not a good writer. But Nolan is a very very good writer what an genius he is.He has given the film of the decade for sure.I don't want to tell anything about the plot of the movie. just go and enjoy the movie.Nolan will get Oscar for at least two categories Dicaprio's no no Cobb's acting he live as Cobb. I would be surprised if he didn't get Oscar for it.It is very rare to see a movie which has very good action and and very good story behind itThe music in this film is perfect, never intrusive Flaws of the movie I don't find any. one thing i can say is that You might need to see at least twice to understand it.Thanks for such wonderful film",1
"An imperishable, spectacular and brilliant movie.For me, this movie is 8.5/10 but because of haters like victor602 so I rate it 10/10.Heath Ledger is dead so victor602 please show some respect to him and don't be such a hater. You rated this movie and Indiana John, Ironman 1/10 and you told other people's brains are damaged. WTF! Take your old mind out of those movies, man. If you don't like those ""Hollywood trash"" (like you said), you just stay at home and sleep because I know new movies are not gonna satisfy your old mind. Sorry, I just want to tell him because I was too angry.Congratulations to the cast and crew of Batman: The Dark Knight for bringing us this years blockbuster and for revitalizing a series destroyed by Cloony and Arnold.",1
"Warning!! ( Many spoilers)First Tim Burton directed two films opening the legacy. Next, Joel Schumacher continued two more films, but for lesser quality. Now Chris Nolan has made ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" something to treasure forever.There are three things that won me over with this movie. First, this film pushes the envelope to a near R-Rating. There so much gunfire, explosions, and gruesome images that I felt tensed of what would happen next. I love movies that take risks because if more movies exercised play-safe techniques, we would be watching ""Batman and Robin"" all over again. Second is Heath Ledger's brilliant performance. Although less comical, ledger's character is realistic, menacing, and truly horrifying. A true psychopath, which Ledger brings so much realism. Even if there is no posthumous Oscar nomination, Ledger will most definitely live on as a movie legend. Not a single online hater complaining about the film's length, darkness, or complex story can take away Ledger's status. Finally the third thing is the film has first-rate storytelling. There is a surprise twist and a nail-biting action sequence at every corner. The action is also evenly balanced with the plot and characterization. Its more than just a good v.s. evil film. There is real conflict and real turmoil that plays on both sides of law enforcers and law violators. The film concerns Batman/Bruce Wayne trying to make the city a better place. while crooks and copycat vigilantes run amok, the Joker associates himself with powerful crime bosses. Through countless terrorist attacks, the Joker commands the citizens of Gotham to do whatever he wants as long as he controls their fears and emotions. Sometimes there is no clear motive or explanation about the Joker's past, but he wants to unmask Batman and try to make him appear villainous in the face of Gotham. The Joker is anything but a two-dimensional villain. He had a conflicted childhood just like Bruce, but he uses his angst, his rage, and his emotions to hurt others rather than protect them. Bruce Wayne on the other hand soon wants to hang up his Batman suit and settle with his love Rachel Dawes, since DA Harvey Dent is leading a revolution against all citywide crime. That is until later, when Harvey Dent makes a transformation into the monstrous Two-Face. Who is just as scary and sinister as the Joker. From that moment onward its a crazy roller coaster ride of thrills, unpredictability, and tragedy.Although the movie is long, there is sharp editing, outstanding performances, great stunt work, a superb script, and enough memorable moments to make the 2.5 hours zip by. A MOVIE MASTERPIECE.",1
"I'm gonna start like this: The movie touched me and I think it is great, but it does have flaws.
First off: Good production, well casted and great acting, one of Freeman's best roles and setting, camera, costumes, props etc. have a high standard.
I think the plot was good, but for the most part predictable, nothing surprised me, still a smart and touching prison story.
Yet I caught myself doubting some parts of the happenings and sometimes the production looked too slick.
I don't think it's a 10 since there are small things I would've done differently, giving it 9/10 since it's still a great movie.",1
"I think, The Best Batman Film Ever. Everyone must watch",1
"why is everyone determined to believe that good movies are not been made these days???????? there have been many who still believe that godfather deserves to be on the first spot????? even i consider godfather as one of the best,but yet i m not comparing it with ""the dark knight"" cause ""the dark knight"" crossed every limit of entertainment . i wonder what was missing in it? was it action?......drama...thrill......acting....direction....no way,nothing was left....it had all of them........ i don't think there is any point of saying this movie ""not the greatest""...it was no where a simple superhero movie...it was much more than it.....it was.....the best movie that i had ever seen...cause while sitting in the theater i didn't felt for moving my hands to have a bite of popcorn.....i really loved the movie......its deserves 10/10",1

The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect film. One of the reasons why I got into filmmaking. It's an inspiration and should be required viewing for any filmmaker.,1
"Just like Ellen Page's character Ariadne says ""It is pure creation"" This quote summarizes whole movie. Inception is a well through implicitly written and edited , deep , thrilling and above all INTELLIGENT summer sci-fi block buster we miss so much for years.The reason and genius behind this work of art is one name : Christopher Nolan. This is his handiwork , his final work on through , conscious and sub conscious mind state. He spent ten years to complete the script. Believe me. It shows on the screen. Since Memento we see his obsession on time , memories , dreaming , emotional pain , loss , tragedy in dark noir sense....Now I have decided that these aspects are his trademarks...But boy he uses them excellently especially in Inception. He is not after latest CGI explosion. For him CGI and other special effect tricks are just tools to tell his story and his characters. And due to his trade marks I mentioned above his stories , characters are serious and involving. As you go one layer after another you give yourself as a whole to understand the plot and characters. In Inception whole audience is so mesmerized when it ended with that ending there were lots of ""ahhhhhhh""s. Christopher Nolan does not insult audience and their intelligence. He trusts them. He creates a maze at first half then puts us right in it. He does not bore and lower his standards with lame teenager jokes and sex appeal of latest no talent chicks. He does not make fun movies. But he also leaves entertainment element in his productions. There is humor but subtle and timely. There is action but it is on the spot and not over the top. There are few clichés if none. It is not predictable. You do not know what is coming next. Time difference , cut/edit work between several dream levels are jaw dropping. Several scenes like zero gravity fight at hotel or slow motion drop of van are sure to be cult moments for fans. They reek of elegant artistic work. Nolan takes his work seriously. He is making what Alfred Hitchkock or Stanley Kubrick was doing in previous decades. He is working on 7th Art....Main characters also display an impressive performance on screen. Leonardo Di Caprio ( who is becoming more legendary and professional because he chooses his projects carefully ) is the main protagonist of Inception....his character Dom Cobb is an Extractor , a thief of thoughts and ideas in dream state and he is one of the best. A fugitive for a murder he did not commit he is on run around the world and he is also a haunted man marked with tragedy. Inception is primarily Cobb's story...his dealings with his loss and his quest to reunite with his children. Caprio puts his best performance with this character. Joseph Gordon Levitt is Arthur the Point Man , Cobb's partner in extracting operations. I saw Levitt first time in that awful GI Joe movie last year. But here he was quite excellent. Ellen Page surprised me with her decent performance as Ariadne the Arcitect , builder of dreams and a recent addition to Cobb's team. She performed as a very mature , wise character , a voice of reason for Cobb. Tom Hardy ( I know him from Star Trek Nemesis movie , Band of Brothers and Colditz mini series ) was another amazing stand out as wise cracking Eames the Forger. And let's not forget wonderful French actress Marion Cotillard as Mal , main villain of Inception....Cotillard was quite good when I saw her first time in Public Enemies last year. But in Inception her acting is beyond words. Her glare was enough...Other actors Ken Watanabe ( Last Samurai , Letters from Iwo Jima ) as Saito the Tourist who hired Cobb and his team for ""Inception"" , Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer the Mark ( quite a normal and emotional character a real change for Murphy ) , Dillop Rao as Yusuf the Chemist and Tom Berenger as Browning were also quite impressive. Legendary Michael Caine also has a short role as Miles. Cast is quite international. ( British , Irish , American , Canadian , Japanese , French ) It seems that Nolan is not interested working with latest Hollywood celebrity. He is interested working with a talented cast...And you know what ? It worksLast thoughts : Thank God for Christopher Nolan. When we despaired of Hollywood and its finished creativity he served us Inception....A movie that incepts ideas in minds , inspires , starts creativity....It is not a comic book rip-off or a remake of another classic. I know some would say that Inception was ripped from Japanese animes to Matrix , Uncle Scrooge comics...So what ? Nolan never denied that he used ideas from James Bond movies , ""13th Floor"" ( another impressive production ) , Matrix....He mixed them so well you do not realize that fact at all. Pay no attention to them. As for me...I am eagerly waiting Inception DVD....",1
"This movie is amazing. The characters are great, the drama is easy to follow and is riveting. Batman is incredible, and has that perfect balance of realism and superhero likeness. However, things that make this film are The Joker and Harvey Dent/Two-Face. These villains are amazing. The Joker is probably the best interpretation that has came around, and Harvey Dent/Two-Face is fun before and after his transformation. Other things that make this film are the twists and suspense. Certain scenes really got under my skin and made me on the edge of my seat. When that single guitar chord pops up, you know it's going to go down. I have no complaints for this film, and I expected to have atleast one. However, I don't. It's honestly, a great superhero movie and a masterpiece in-general. There's a lot of quotable lines and scenes that mainly dive deep into our characters and their chemistry, as well as their mind and how they think. Anyone who loves Batman and DC in general should: See. This. Film. 10/10.",1
"The first act is pure exposition. Once that's over, the film gets a lot better, even if it never really goes as far with the craziness of the dreamworld as it probably should have.",1
"This was one of the most excellent movie I have ever seen. Such great acting and characters this movie turns out to be more than your expectations. You might see many jail movies but nothing is even near to this movie. The best line is ""Andy Dufresne was my friend."" The way Morgan freeman says it, it's wonderful. Acting of Tim Robbins is remarkable. I really wonder why this movie could not win Oscars. Having Morgan Freeman in film itself is a tag of excellent script. Besides that direction is also very well done. You will not have seen such planned and brilliant movie till now Do watch it. This movie deserves to be on top.",1
"Revisiting the film, in addition to the picture, the plot to the inspiration and bring meditation, but also good enough! Not only has the complete and smooth logic structure, but also tells the whole story the true and false is difficult to distinguish. Inceptionist and dreamer, character setting is also full of creativity and freshness. Dreamers link dream sense is very realistic, learned in the dream, emotional fluctuations caused by the street explosion, enough stunning. It takes a complete combing of Leonardo's line with his wife, Mel, and what happens when he returns from the lost world to determine where reality is and where dreams are. Observe the small plum's ring, if wearing the ring indicated in the dream, if not wearing, then in reality. Norland's film is also full of thought-provoking philosophy, Mel can not distinguish between reality and dreams, and eventually die, but who can prove that reality must be reality? It's just that the man is dead, and everyone has to look at himself.",1
Love the concepts and creativity. Brilliant acting and mind-bending story that still has us debating our interpretation of what the ending actually is.,1
"One of the most noticeable elements that was employed in the film Fight Club was the use of production design. The entire film had a dark feel to it, and the production design was composed in such a way that the darkness of the film progressed throughout its length. In the beginning of the film, the costume and set were selected in a way that seemed realistic, as though to appeal to our sense of connection to the character in the film. Despite this, the lighting, and of course the narration from the main character led us to notice something was clearly amiss. The main character was certainly not the average person.After having watched the film, one subtle, yet extremely powerful instance of foreshadowing happens when the main character narrates: ""If you wake up in a different time, in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?"" The camera then pans to centre the motion around Tyler, as if to show that maybe the main character could wake up as Tyler. The irony of this is, of course, that the main character really does wake up as Tyler, but the element is subtle because, at this point in the film, the viewer has yet to be formally exposed to Tyler.Throughout the film, Tyler's and the main character's are always in contrast. Through his costume, Tyler is portrayed as laid back, care- free, and dare I say it, cool. On the other hand, the main character generally tries to dress more formally, depending on the occasion. However, as the film progresses, the main character seems to become increasingly like Tyler. The main character shows up to work in tattered clothes, a sharp contrast to the suit and tie that he always wore for the first 40 or so minutes of the film. It gets to the point where the only difference in Tyler and the main character's outfit is an undone bow-tie, seen in the scene where they coerce the mayor. The bond that the main character feels toward Tyler and his ideas quickly dissipates when Bob is killed, and their outfits return to being highly contrasting, to show that the main character is no longer on Tyler's 'side'.After the main character, and the audience, realise that he is really Tyler Durden, the film switches between realistic and formalistic shots. When the main character is getting beat up by Tyler in the garage, the main action is more formalistic, as it is known that what we are seeing is just happening in the main character's head. However, the camera frequently switches to security cameras, which is fitting being that they are in a car garage. This different photography shows what is happening in the 'real world' as it shows the main character just throwing himself around, and causing severe injury to himself in the process. By adding this to the film, some context is brought into how the main character could have actually believed that Tyler was a separate person. His mind is so warped, that he can seriously injure himself just from his mind playing tricks on him. Despite the physical location of the shots being completely different (one being in the garage, and the other in the security room) the film is edited so the transition is seamless and continuity is preserved completely. This makes the transition between the formalistic and realistic shots fluid with the action and not seem jarring or out of place. The music in this scene also assists the director in getting his point across. The music is like what would be played in a horror film, with high- pitched, fast violins, and strange sounds. This helps to build an almost nightmarish atmosphere in the film as it seems like what the main character is experiencing is something most people only ever face in a bad dream. He is utterly helpless to the wrath of Tyler and the thrilling music makes the audience feel some of the terror that the main character is feeling in this scene.",1
I saw the move 2 times and every time experience it again .. Great move great acting and directing .,1
"Best film I have been came across till date what a concept what suspense
Not only films subject but it's emotional balance is also way deel",1
"Simply the best film of the last (and probably next) decade. I was blown away by this movie. A work of pure genius. In equal turns I was entertained, moved and ultimately affected by it. As a somewhat dis-illusioned thirty something I really felt that it had special meaning for me. I don't agree that this is a 'bloke' movie. I think that if you take such a narrow minded point of view then you are missing the point and ultimately the underlying themes created within this cinematic masterpiece. Edward Norton is simply incredible and is rightly described as 'one of the few truly great actors of our generation.' Brad Pitt was also outstanding actually playing with an honesty too often denied a film actor of his type. I would like to see more Norton/Pitt collaborations in the future. In conclusion Fight Club is an experience that no-one should miss. It is truly awesome.",1
"Firstly.. Jesus Christ! I was not expecting that! This movie blew me away.Lets start basic natural attraction. This movie had realistic action that was still breath taking. Several scenes, including one with The Joker performing a Magic Trick, are spiced with Brutal violence that will leave you screaming ""OHH F@#%, YOU GOT OWNED"". The Fighting had the same type of realism as The Bourne Series. The Explosions, always jaw dropping. The Driving, Flat out riveting and nail biting. The Intensity of some sequences will leave you speech-less. The Acting, Oh My. What an incredible cast. Every performance was so believably real and just oozed with passion for the role. Every single actor and actress played their designated role flawlessly. Heath Ledger. . . In God's Honest Truth.. Deserves an Oscar for his role. I am not saying this because of him recently passing away, I'm saying this because he was sick, twisted, and deep in his eyes you could see.. He WAS The Joker. He was beyond amazing, not a soul on earth could have done a better job than him.Into the depths of this movie. This movie in general in a say on human's natural instinct. It is a insight into the human soul and the primal instincts of everyone. To put a specific scene into view here I'll refer to the Boat Scene.**SPOILERS**In this scene it is the joker stating to Batman that he can bring out the evil in the world. Joker was pulling the evil in people out into plain view. Shattering peoples appearance and their statements on their own morals. By putting their lives on the line. In Simpler view Joker put a gun to a mans head and said ""i will kill you unless you kill the man in the chair with a bag over his face."" Trying to prove that once humans are rattled and frightened they will let loose there evil and break all rules giving into anarchy and madness, exactly what Joker was striving for. Also in this scene it not only tackles human nature, be two key modern stereotypes. 1: All Convicts are Terrible Murderer's. and the other stereotype 2: View of Convicts from modern citizens. And this scene examines these stereotypes in many ways. When the boats uproar in shouting and screaming, in the heat of the moment, people fighting for the detonator, everyone is ready to blow the other ship. Until people calm down and process the situation, asking themselves if they should take the other peoples lives. This is where the key insight is. That any human in the heat of a moment can make a mistake, but in the human mind all people who can stop and process things, are capable of good, thats is why no one pulled the pin. When not blocked by adrenaline the human mind works wonders and can accept any fate at the cost of what is right and good. People like the Joker cannot do this because they cannot slow down, or make a PLAN. He states that himself whilst talking to Two-Face in the hospital.Then when Joker see's neither ship explode it is hard for him to accept because he was so sure the people on the boat would act in haste and be quick to blow each other away. Though Good prevailed and he caught that glimpse of hope for Gotham and all of mankind, showing that Good and Right still existed in these unfair, dog-eat-dog, modern times.**END SPOILERS**Essentially that is why this movie is so good. Their are many other aspects to this movie as well that make it good, like the music, the filming, the script and much more.This movie is a Master-Piece in every sense.10/10 Dark Knight, You knocked me onto my A**.",1
"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.",1
"Inception is simply put an incredible film with so many good things going for it. This movie is basically set in this futuristic world(no one knows the time period) where there is this new technology where a subject is able to enter another subject's dreams through inception. It is a BRILLIANT concept for a movie and Nolan does a fantastic job with that concept through the direction and the script. WOW DOES NOLAN HAVE EXCELLENT WRITING! I have never seen a movie like this in a while! Now many critics are bashing this movie saying ""Oh. ITS TOO CONFUSING!"" ""There is barely any character development"" BLAH! BLAH! BLAH! Seriously? OK sure there is barely any character development in the supporting cast but there is a lot of development in Cobb with his relationship with Mal. I will not go in any detail with this plot since you will not understand. Even till this day, I still don't understand what makes it such a good movie maybe because you catch these wonderfully-thought ideas that Nolan created! Now, lets move on to the cast. The cast in this couldn't have been more perfect! Leonardo Dicaprio plays Cobb who is one of the best extractors in the world but there is a reason he has to do this though. I will not reveal how until you see this film. Anyway, Ellen Page plays Ariadne who is the architect of Cobb's extraction team. Then there's a plethora of fine talent: Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and CILLIAN MURPHY! Now, can we just say that this is an amazing cast or what? Plus, the visuals are absolutely stunning! But other than that, this movie will boggle your mind and will leave you scratching your head so please do Nolan a favor and go see his masterpiece!",1
"As i have been a fan of the Caped Crusader since i was a small child, i have seen all the Batman movies and from the moment i saw that The Dark Knight would appear i have been waiting for it anxiously.My wait was worth wile as this movie is 1 of the best movies i have ever seen.I expected it to be a very good film as i was also very impressed by Batman Beggins,but this movie surpassed all expectations.The plot itself is superb, very complex storyline, many twists and turns with fantastically complex characters.This movie in my opinion is very psychological as it uncovers many deep parts of the characters persona,also this is 1 of those movies that makes u think about everything u hear.Intelligent,mind-challenging discussions, reflections on many life matters, in other words a very intelligent movie, not a simple superhero movie.The characters being so complex, fantastic acting was needed and it was obtained with the late Heath Leadger(God rest his soul) as The Joker and Christian Bale in the role of the Caped Crusader(a.k.a. Batman).Of course the other actors did a fantastic job but the 2 main characters performances were astonishing.Bale is no doubt about it THE BEST Batman of all times as he reveals the real soul and mind of Bruce Wayne and The Batman.All the anguish,pain,suffering,sacrifices and more,all of them are here.Heath also created a Joker never before seen, its the kind of Joker that shocks you,scares you,makes you laugh and make you cry,all at the same time.I hope both actors rec-eave an academy award as they deserve it.Of course accompanied by all of this, the visual effects,music and the action in the movie are great to and fit the movie perfectly.The music used chills you to the bone, the action keeps you tense all through the movie and the effects simply silence you.Overall this is not just a simple superhero movie, it is a masterpiece, a psychological action, mystery and drama movie like no other.I strongly suggest going to see this movie as you will not be disappointed, the movie will shock you( in a very good way) like you have never been shocked before.",1
"Stephen King Crime, DramaRated R142 minutes| Roger Ebert September 23, 1994 | Print Page""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.WATCH NOWThe story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.",1
"I love this movie, certainly one of my favorites, both surprising and captivating. Films like these are becoming increasingly scarce. His director is once more overflowing with imagination and the end of the film is extraordinary. I advise those who have not yet seen it. But it would surprise me ^^",1
"In today's day and age, superhero movies run amok in Cinemas all around the world. Just like crappy horror and action movies of the 80's, comic book movies are everywhere. From the turds like ""Catwoman"" to the decent like ""Blade"" to the classic like ""X2:X-Men United"", they have all felt like comic book movies. But there was one franchise that went from decent to horrid in a span of 8 years. It was Batman, going from ""Batman"" to ""Batman and Robin"" from 1989 to 1997. And when everyone counted out the franchise, they were in for a rude awakening.In 2005 WB and Christopher Nolan came together and made ""Batman Begins"", a movie that transcended the genre and made people clamor for a sequel. Well in 2008, Christopher Nolan returned and brought with him the old team and newcomers Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhall and Jonathan Nolan. This was a movie hyped for so long because of the last one and the buzz around Ledger's performance around the Joker. Well after three years of waiting, it arrived. And the question on everyone's mind is ""Does it live up to the hype?"" Well a simple answer in yes. But it is so much more complex that that. It is not only the greatest movie of 2008 or the greatest comic book movie, it is the best movie of the decade and one of the best crime dramas ever.The movie starts right where Batman Begins ended. The Joker and his goons are robbing a bank. But this isn't an ordinary bank or robbery. During the robbery, the henchmen start picking each other off. We find out the Joker told them each to make the cuts better. But they don't he's there with them. Also, this is a mob bank. So the manager doesn't go down without a fight. He pulls out a shotgun and goes to town. But he is dispatched off and we get our first glimpse off The Joker. Things only get better from here.After the robbery, we are treated to a gang meeting. Apparently the drugs being bought have odd side effects. Turns out the dealer is none other than Scarecrow. Cillian Murphy is back, but it's only a cameo to tie this to ""Batman Begins"". This scene works very well. It shows us the fake Batmen running around. It also shows us that Batman isn't happy with his suit.Things really kick off during the meeting of the mob. All the remaining bosses met to discuss the cops recovering the laundered money, led by Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman). They also briefly mention The Joker, but they feel he's a nobody. Then he crashes the party. He shows us a nice little magic trick and talks to the bosses. We find out he plans to kill Batman. After this scene, the movie just kicks it into high gear. I don't wanna spoil the movie for anyone, so I'll stop discussing the plot.Let's get this out of the way, Heath Ledger is no where in this movie. All we get is the Joker. It's a performance for the ages. Quite possibly the greatest performance of all time. Every scene he's in, he chews up the scenery. He's hilarious and frightening at the same time. The third time I saw it, I was still tense whenever he showed up. He's brutal, manic, psychotic, hilarious and very smart. The ultimate screen villain. He makes things harder for future Jokers.Everyone else in the movie is also amazing. Christian Bale is still the best Batman and Bruce Wayne. He is intimidating and charming. Gary Oldman is given more to do this time and he owns it. Amazing to watch as Jim Gordon, one of the only good cops in town. Morgan Freeman is still good as Lucius Fox, Bruce's source of gadgets. Michael Caine still works as Alfred. Maggie Gyllenhall is a step up from Katie Holmes but Rachel is still an annoying character.The most under rated performance is definitely Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. He is really great in the role. He owns Harvey Dent. He starts out as the White Knight of Gotham, a really admirable man. But he slowly becomes a ruined man, culminating into his change into Two Face. It's really fantastic.One of the best things about this movie is it managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. I thought I knew what was gonna happen, but I was always pleasantly surprised. The twists and turns in this movie never felt forced or gimmicky. It was all a natural progression of the story. Same goes with the action scenes. There aren't many, but the ones there are amazing. Nolan really knows what he's doing. The action was all natural progression.This movie is a lot darker than every other comic book movie before, excluding ""Sin City"". It really kept it's promise about escalation and how things are gonna get worse before they better. It is ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of this generation. It really is amazing how Nolan and company made such a groundbreaking movie. This movie transcends the genre of comic book movie. It's the second movie to transcend the genre, the first being ""Batman Begins"". It is an epic crime drama. It really ranks as one of the best of all time. It managed to be better than the hype which was out of this world. It's my fourth favorite movie ever. Nolan is now my second favorite director ever, Heath Ledger is my second favorite actor. Oldman and Eckhart move up in my list after this flick. A once in a lifer time event. It is truly a challenge to make a third movie that lives up to the hype. Absolutely amazing.",1
"I went to see the Dark Knight last night and it was exactly as good as I thought it would be. But it certainly isn't the masterpiece you'd think it is after reading most of the reviews on IMDb. Sure, Heath Ledger is brilliant as the Joker. And yes, for a movie that lasts two hours and a half, it's extremely entertaining (especially considering the fact I usually avoid blockbusters like the plague). It really got me hooked. But that's it. To me, some characters just weren't that well thought out. Harvey Dent and Rachel in particular that is. Did anyone believe for a second that there was this 'true love' happening between them? The woman was obviously just thinking: so Batman still doesn't have any time for me, I'll just stick with this bloke, who, for some crazy reason (since I'm obviously not that beautiful plus very annoying), seems to be crazy about me. So yeah, Rachel was a huge let-down. Another thing I really didn't like, is the fact that they were showing Dents face all the time after he came out of the hospital. Suggestion is so much more effective. But hey, Batman and the Joker definitely made the movie worthwhile! With the right casting, the next Batmanmovie by Nolan should be a real classic.",1
"The imagery was amazing; one memorable scene (*SPOILER) was when the project mayhem army was tilling the backyard field while Tyler spoke on a megaphone ""you are not a beautiful snowflake.""  THe entire scene was shot like a warzone out of ""Saving Private Ryan""..absolutely fascist! The use of special effects was cool too, it was nice to see how technology can accentuate artwork in other ways besides creating velociraptors and such.
what a good movie! hilarious at times, wierd at times, but entertaining all through the film.  IT explores themes such as masculinity, corporatism, consumerism, and so on, and the acting is great.  as the film nears a close, though, the plot becomes more and more strange.  The final ending was a bit much for me (*SPOLIERS ABOUT TO BE DIVULGED), especially when he shot himself in the mouth.  Somehow, that shot killed tyler, but didn't kill him. The buildings blowing up and the fall of corporations was all right, but him somehow surviving a shot to the head, and then talking afterward kind of took away from the ending.  Maybe i just don't get it.",1
I could watch like 50 times and i would still not get tired of it. Really touching and unforgettable.,1
"Supposedly this film took 10 years to write. It's one of the most well crafted, suspenseful, and intriguing films ever made. Along with the cinematography, the speed of the story never slows with all of the constant action. The only intellectual film I've ever viewed that will also keep you on the edge of your seat. Leonardo DiCaprio is magnificent. The story reveals what is going on though his mind throughout the entire film, and for once the unattractive voice over's are omitted. Anyone with the slightest interest in dreams, imaginative manipulation, or psychology will rank this film in their top 10 films of all time. This film literally becomes more and more genius every time I watch it.",1
"This film could very easily be frowned upon if one doesn't really look at what's being presented.  From the blunt title to the underlying theme of fist-fight clubs, on face value 'Fight Club' would be seen as just a macho man-movie with nothing behind it.  The actual violence isn't really that much if you think about it....only one person actually dies in the movie. As someone pointed out in the DVD booklet, you see more violence in the first 10 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' than you see in all 139 minutes of Fight Club.  The highlight of the film is the great acting and even better dialogue. This is one of those films that can stand on its piercing dialogue alone, you don't feel that its 2 hours and 20 minutes.  This is Edward Norton's finest performance along with Primal Fear and probably American History X. This is also one of Brad Pitt's best moments, he played the alter ego perfectly.  David Fincher has a knack for the disjointed, dark feel, and he uses it to perfection here.Fight Club is a much deeper film than one would think, seeing how it was marketed and advertised.  As far as it being on the Top 250 list, that's probably attributed more to male teens just infatuated with the macho male pride fist-fighting and blood rather than the message buried inside.  Still, 'Fight Club' is one of the best films to come out in the past few years.***1/2 out of **** stars.",1
"When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like? After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's great stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch it, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic",1
"There's no more information to tell then what others already have said. For me this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. A great story, top of the line acting and a very good mix of actors. There's only 1 thing left to say if you have never seen it....you NEED to see this movie!",1
I love this film. I hope it's similar to these films,1

"Christopher Nolan's newest mind game, turned blockbuster, turned art-house shows that Nolan is the real deal. A master at his craft and a firecracker of a writer. Here's a story so deep, emotional and down right confusing, for me to reveal any or most of the tricks would simply baffle me and confuse you. Nolan's cerebral outing is compelling and visually challenging than anything out in the last several years. His ability to construct this world with as much depth and passion still play to the highly entertaining crowd as a Blockbuster hidden in the rough is remarkable. A captivating film, with wonderful and careful cinematography and cast, designed for their talent and not a distraction.",1

"A Review of The Shawshank RedemptionThis film acts like a commentary on prison life for long term prisoners, but its real theme is one of hope. It draws us in quickly with the drama of a cheating wife and the actions of a scorned husband. However, what really brings us in are the deep soothing tones of Morgan Freeman's (Driving Miss Daisy, Unforgiven) voice-over as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding speaking about his insights into Andy Dufresne.Andy Dufresne is the scorned husband, played by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham, Mystic River), who is accused and convicted of murder even though the evidence is circumstantial and he maintains his innocence. He spends the next twenty years at Shawshank State Prison where he meets Red. Red is one of the guys in the prison who has a way of getting anything one might want smuggled into the prison. One of the first things that Red notices about Andy is that he conducts himself as a free man who is unaffected by the surrounding prison. Andy has difficulty at first as he falls prey to a group of inmates called ""the sisters"" and referred to as bull queers. This goes on until Andy shows his worth as banker to the lead guard, Captain Hadley played by Clancy Brown (Highlander, Starship Troopers). Hadley provided Andy's inmates with beer in exchange for Andy's services. The beer made the inmates feel like free men again and Andy's services got him noticed by the warden. The warden, played by Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, Evita), provided Andy with protection from the ""sisters"", allowed him to fix-up the library, and allowed him to help some inmates earn their high school diplomas in exchange for Andy's help with laundering money that proceeded from the warden's many schemes. So, we are presented with a bleak situation that is reinforced by dirty sets and mostly gray and blue colors. The make-up used to age the actors gradually over twenty years, combined with the acting, work together to make us believe that all of this could happen and is real. We are made to feel sorry for these inmates most of whom are suffering the consequences of their own horrible crimes. And, as if doing the dirty work of the self-righteous who stand in judgment over Andy isn't enough, the warden has the one person who can get Andy out of prison executed. In spite of all of this Andy maintains a hope for the future that ""they"" can't touch. The Shawshank Redemption is a really good film that leaves the viewer with a feeling of triumph and a life lesson that goes beyond prison walls.",1
"What even needs to be said about Nolan's batman films? With the exception of the last of the trilogy being a bit too long and unmotivated, this is as close as batman comes to perfection. Give it a watch, the movie will blow your mind.",1
"I finally saw Inception, last year on TBS on demand, before my cable got cut off and I will review. The story is amazing and I give credit to Christopher Nolan because he has directed this film, produced the Superman reboot, directed THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY, The Prestige and Interstellar.The visuals look amazingly well-done as always in Christopher Nolan's films and I could not have seen better. The music by Hans Zimmer is just amazing. Put the visual effects, music and cinematography by Wally Pfister together and you have an incredible feature film.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a great performance and his character gets a lot of backstory. Marion Cotillard played his wife and she is amazing in her performance. The performances are all good in this film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played in this film and he was simply amazing.Ellen Page is amazing in this movie and the rest of the cast is amazing as well in this film. The movie is not only based on an original idea, it is also well made by a great director and the plot is also really cool.THE FILM IS RATED PG-13, so there may be some intense action sequences throughout and I love that this movie shoes the differences between what we see in our dreams and in reality between the dream world and the real world.Overall, I love INCEPTION and Christopher Nolan has created a cinematic masterpiece that does not get enough credit. 10/10, this film is an ABSOLUTE SMASH HIT!",1
"Everything about this movie is amazing. Every time I watch it it draws me in line the first time. Beautiful editing, acting, imagination... everything!",1
"Somehow you knew seeing the trailers that this movie could possibly be one of the best ever but you tell yourself, ""Nah, you're just buying the hype."" Well it's better than it's hype and when nominating movies for best-movies-of-all-time lists you have to let it cool for a while, but I wouldn't be surprised if this went down in history as one of the big ones.We'd all heard that Heath was amazing in this and it's absolutely true. It wasn't like he was acting. It was like the Joker was leaking out of his pores. Because not only was he absolutely this character, but the character he created is in itself a masterpiece. Of course you have to also give credit to the Nolans who wrote the character. The way that this written character and this actor came together to create a whole other kind of being will have to be explained scientifically someday. And I'm sure I won't even understand the explanation because it's close to something I stopped believing in a long time ago, and that's magic. They caught lightning in a bottle if you will. You'll have to see it to believe it.But here's the problem with a performance like this, it can blow the other actors out of the water. But in an amazing feat by the entire cast, no one is left out to dry. Everyone is tip-top. And one of my favorite actors, Aaron Eckhart, does such wonderful work in this. It's almost sad that he won't get more attention for it because the focus is on Heath, but I'm sure eventually everyone will come around. Harvey Dent goes through so much. I can't explain further without spoiling, but Eckhart went through a full range of emotion in this film. There is a scene with him and Heath that is already one of my favorite scenes ever. Remember the restaurant scene in 'Heat'? Well, it's kid stuff compared to this one. That's right, I said it.Now let me say something about Christian Bale. I think he may possibly be the best actor of his generation. And in this film he allows everyone else to take the shine. Don't get me wrong. He does the work and does it well but some other actors might be threatened and you'd notice some histrionics to garner the spotlight, especially when they're the title character, but not Bale. His slow and steady Batman was like the rock holding everything in place. Like Alfred is to Bruce Wayne, Bale was to his other actors.Assembling such an outstanding cast, writing such an intricate film, and directing the whole thing is Christopher Nolan, who is now officially one of my favorite directors. I loved 'The Prestige'. On repeated viewings, it still knocks me on my butt. I was shocked at how high I had to include that film on my all time favorites list (yes I keep a list). Usually it takes me a while to bump something up out of respect to the other films but I thought it was brilliant and couldn't help myself. Well, I'm not even going to attempt to crack open my list for 'The Dark Knight' for a while. I fear for my top ten. The imagery, the music, costume design are all perfect. I mean there had to be something wrong with it right? I did have one complaint. But realizing that the plot point in question may not be what it seems, means I can't even complain about that. What I think happened may have not happened and even if it did then it's just a matter of preference and doesn't have anything to do with how insanely stupendous and awe-inspiringly magnificent 'The Dark Knight' is.Who shouldn't see this movie? People with no senses. Maybe that one guy or gal you hate, so they won't get to enjoy such a gift. It's been 5 days since the first time I saw it, 1 since the second and I haven't stopped talking about it. I can't stop saying words like ""best"" and ""ever"" and ""amazing"". I'm going to wish as hard as I can that the Academy will decide that they need an award for Best Cast this year before it's too late. It's early but I'm hoping this at least gets a Best Picture nomination. If you haven't seen it yet, I'd like to see a doctor's note.",1
The wonderful masterpiece which is very emotional and gives a sigh of relief at the end. Wonderful movie and amazing chain of events level screenplay. One of the finest work by Stephen King.,1
"The question is simple. The answer, not so much.If this question is ever answered by the explanation of some brash, barbaric action film, I would suggest you end your conversation (and maybe friendship) with your counterpart immediately. I can't understand how many times I've heard this film described in such a way and it truly irks me and proves nothing more than the fact that this person was unable to look past the title. I'm almost certain this was actually Chuck Palahniuk's original idea in naming his book Fight Club: weed out the narrow minded audience and speak to the people in search of something more. In any case, the action in the film is not representative of the story, it is more so used as a platform to relay some of the underlying messages. There is incredible depth behind this film and you need to look past some of its seemingly tasteless features to find it.Likewise, if this question is ever answered with a simple explanation, these people do not understand the film. The beauty of Fight Club is understanding that you cannot fully understand it. With hundreds of separate messages combined into one plot, there is no way to grasp the subject matter at hand. There are two forms of incomprehensible art: art that is so poorly constructed that it's intentions are not properly relayed, and art that is so methodical that putting it into words will only destroy it's beauty. Fight Club is the latter. From solely a film point of view, the execution is fantastic. Being a devout Palahniuk fan and having read the book, I could not think of two actors who would have represented their characters better than Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Not to mention, they had an incredible challenge on their hands in basically putting an entire film on their shoulders. The supporting cast mast have had about 30 lines of dialogue in total, meaning Pitt, Norton and Helena Bonham Carter needed to be extraordinary in order to create a successful movie, which they were. The filming was exceptional and Fincher's interpretation and display were the reason it turned into a classic. In my mind, Fincher's greatest accomplishment was his ability to astound a numb 1990's society.This film truly changed my outlook on many aspects of life. I know the film has different effects on different people, and some may not see it as ""life changing"", but it is a must watch for everybody. Touching on a range of topics - corporate takeover, modern society's view of men, and mental instability just to name a few - it was truly transcendent.Palahniuk created the masterpiece, Fincher created a classic, and Pitt/Norton created perfection. Watch this movie.",1
"This movie is fantastic. I do not know where to begin. It leaves you with the same wondrous feeling Avatar gives you when you first see it. The acting is brilliant, the effects fantastic, Christopher Nolan's directing is superb but the best thing is his screenplay. The story just like The Dark Knight among others is completely captivating and entrancing. The plot is insanely complicated like Nolan's Memento but this is easier to follow and is a much better film. This is by far the best movie to come out in 2010 and may win the academy award for Best Picture. It deserves to be nominated for so many things. It deserves a nod for Best Actor (DiCaprio), Best Supporting Actress (Marion Cotillard/Ellen Page), Best Original Screenplay & Direction (Nolan), Effects, & Best Picture. That is 7 Nominations. I am not even thinking about sound and editing and minor things like that. Of course we must wait for the second half of the year to finish up but I have a hard time imagining another film beating this out for Best Picture. The film keeps you gripped and plays with your mind the entire film. I loved these other two films but it is better then The Dark Knight and Avatar. Avatar just does not have the originality that this film has. This is a masterpiece and is the best film Christopher Nolan has ever done and he has done some great movies. If you would like to talk to me about this review email me at uwanttoknome@aim.com and please mark whether or not this review helped I would really appreciate that.",1
"is the best movie ever made i love it This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, This is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite movie ranked in my top 5 list. The movie is based in a prison, where violence, sexual references and profanity are part of the daily life. The story line is excellent with great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman especially. I have watched this movie over 20 times and still enjoy it every time I see it just as much as the first time.",1
"The movie was a great success. The main character was very positive in all three aspects. In despair also do not give up, and through years of efforts to escape from prison to punish the wicked. The movie's main character allows himself to bring a little hope to the dark prison.",1
"In terms of pop culture, this might be the edgiest movie I've ever seen widely released.  David Fincher continues his remarkable trend of engrossing movies that delve into what our culture is really like.  The movie begins with the Narrator (Edward Norton) tied up in a building with a bomb.  The majority of the movie explains how Norton came to this situation.  He begins with a flashback, describing his depression., the sense of a lack of something he cannot define.  That all changes when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Norton begins to feel something when Pitt eggs him on to ""Punch me.""  Eventually they start fighting on a regular basis.  Norton finds that his aggression rids him of the emptiness left by pop culture. The decent into more and more violence continues until Norton utters the chilling line, ""I wanted to destroy something beautiful.""  At this point Fincher has mined the emotional content of the fight club.  Later the club becomes more like an army, as it struggles to fight those companies it disagrees with.  This sets up the climax of the film, ending Norton's flashback.The greatest strength of the film is this build up.  Norton's character begins his narration explaining that he was looking for the perfect bedroom set to give him happiness.  It takes the fight club to show him that his happiness is not dependent on his possessions.  The film explores the insidious nature of companies that sell their wholesomeness as their main product.  It's a lifestyle you are buying, something to help you escape your own existence for a moment.  The fight club goes against all that.  Rather than take on easy targets like corrupt oil firms or banks, ""Fight Club"" attacks those companies America embraces.  And the way ""Fight Club"" shows to fight the effects contains a dark edge.However, at the end, David Fincher tries to bite off too much and ends up with a hollow ending.  The dark humor and pointed insights that occur throughout the film, the edgy look at an oppressive world, all fade at the end of the film.  I don't think I have ever been so disappointed with a film's ending.  He said so much that was so remarkably pointed in the film, but then wrapped up the plot with a completely implausible ending. Because of this flaw, I drop an obvious masterpiece down to a 7.  Above average, but haunted by the terrific letdown that is the end of the film.",1
Its pretty good and nice must watch oll and nothing say yaaa,1
"This movie is certainly its own genre. It has a different feel than other movies in terms of mystery/suspense. Leonardo DiCaprio and the cast did an outstanding job of keeping the audiences attention and selling the story to its viewers. This is one of those movies that will never get old to me and I could watch it any day, any time,. 10/10",1
The Dark Knight is the best Batman movie ever. I liked the action scenes and the emotional scenes. I like the part where The Batmobile turns into the Batcycle I thought that part was pretty cool. I think Heath Ledger has a great performance as The Joker. There are a few creepy scenes. This Batman film kept my interest through the whole movie and most Batman movies do not. I liked the technology of this film. The Dark Knight is my favorite movie of this year. I think Christopher Nolen did a great job directing this movie he has out done himself. This movie is even better than Batman Begins. I will definitely own this movie when it comes out on DVD.,1
"i was 14 years old when i first saw this film and thought it was a bit weird an pushed it to back of my mind thinking that i was just a bit thick and didn't understand it. like 90% of people who watch this film i was expecting a pretty mindless film about bare knuckle boxing, and being a 14 year old male that appealed to greatly, instead i viewed,which at the time i thought, was a strange weird film. it wasn't until the second time i saw the film i understood what it was truly about and by the time i saw it the third time i was amazed at how accurately it captures the real world. call me crazy but this film altered my whole outlook on life, as a confused teenager this made things clearer me and i cant help but think only the intellectuals amongst us can truly appreciate this work of art. after watching the film i read the book which is just as brilliant as the film but i do think the film gives you a clearer image of what the book is trying to say,exactly what a film based on a book should do, i have spoken to many other people who agree with me that this film makes you look at the world in its scary reality.",1
"A lot of movies I like I have to admit have faults; This is not one of them. You can say whatever you want about this film to me, I don't care. This dark, twisted, incredibly smart masterpiece has not left my mind since I first saw it a week after it opened. Naturally, I was hyped up, but not expecting it to surpass the excellent Batman Begins (with the memory of Spider-Man 3 STILL ringing in my ears), but this movie kills my pessimism. From its crime drama undertones, to its fantastic set-pieces, it all perfectly melds together with thematic depth that most films period, can't fathom. Also, every character is solidly explored, and the film never sacrifices story for character and vice-versa, nor does the action or plot interfere with each other. Every action sequence is just an inevitable confrontation to move the plot and the characters forward, a move that summer movies and Academy-Award films both shamelessly reject.This may be my favorite movie. Don't tell me how its ""just"" an action movie, or how The Godfather is the most complex film ever: it is boring and unimmersive. The Dark Knight is incredible.",1
This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.,1
"""Inception"" is possibly one of the best movies of the decade. When I say that, I don't mean extremely artsy or emotional, or a movie that attempts to get a reaction out of the audience by toying with current social issues. It's a movie that was precariously thought over for years, and then put together with an amazing cast, a thoughtful, original storyline, and stunning visuals. To complain that the story is too complex is ridiculous; It makes you pay attention, and somehow people perceive that as a bad thing. Christopher Nolan (the director) was not attempting to make his movie as complicated as possible to make it a great movie; ""Inception"" is a great movie because is has more depth than movies like ""Avatar"" and ""The Social Network"". The people that I know that disliked this movie (which was very few) typically didn't like it because of its ""loudness"", as in explosions and action sequences, and because it was ""confusing"".Overall, there is little reason to not like this movie, let alone give it one star (what are you people thinking? You really think that this movie is a complete and utter failure!?). Like Cobb said, ""They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything"". Maybe the people who dislike this movie need to watch is while asleep, to fully activate their thinking potential.""Inception"" is simply a very well-rounded, utterly brilliant movie that will bring you into a world of folding cities and twisting hallways. ""Inception"" will bring you in and fill your head with its complexity and perfection, and may even plant an idea inside of you, so be ready, because in ""Inception"", your mind is the scene of the crime.",1
I really like how Batman is portrayed in this trilogy and Joker is magnificent also.,1
"Brad Pitt said that this is a movie that people will not understand a hundred years later, but will anyone really remember this movie a hundred years later? Just like the ending of the movie, in Fighting Club, tall buildings full of doctrines were built, and they saw the buildings collapse ... Then what? Has a new world been established? Who will remember what they did? The destruction of a few buildings and a few people is just a remodeling of the world. Soon the tall buildings will remain meaningless. Personal insanity does not change the world, like a joke.The world is meaningless. What really needs to be changed is people's re-examination of self. Director David Vinci used his wild imagination and creativity to express the propaganda of ideology and the cynicism of ideology, making this film undoubtedly the pinnacle of his personal work, satisfying the director's personal expression of desire And the meaning of ""Brawler Club"" may be like the protagonists of the movie, see",1
"I simply can't express how great this movie is! The concept was very well done and executed including how they managed to effectively visualize parts of the concept. They were also able to sum up the core ideas at the beginning which aids the viewer in understanding how the rest of the movie works. It may seem like a brain workout, but it's not. You need to learn the simple base concepts to understand the movie and that's it. If you further delve deeper then you'll see the true beauty of this movie and how it's complexity provides a stunning experience you simply won't find in any other movie. There is great respect for both realism and the dream part where you as a viewer could also feel how intense the movie is. The movie is a definite must watch.This movie is for everyone! And I would really want everyone to watch this! If you ask me, I'd watch this over and over again....P.S. I liked the concept very much. However, with how great this movie is, please don't make any sequels. A spin off should be fine I guess but no sequels please.",1
"This is one of my all-time favourite movies. It is utterly flawless in its delivery of characterization especially that of The Joker and Harvey Dent/Two Face, the fantastic score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, and of course the overall experience. This is a superhero movie with brains and it should be viewed at least twice. I've seen it four times at the movies just to experience the wow factor I get whenever I watch The Dark Knight.The movie opens with The Joker robbing a bank that was filmed in the IMAX format. From then on the movie becomes an exciting and unpredictable roller coaster ride. It takes sudden sharp turns when you least expect them.Another thing that's incredible about The Dark Knight Trilogy is Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the Batman mythology. He makes sure that Christian Bale emphasizes The Dark Knight's difficulty of trying to put an end to crime. Like anyone aspiring to be a cop, one hopes to rid the world of evil. However that good can backfire right in your face and criminals may want to glorify crime or as Michael Caine quotes in this masterpiece: ""Some men just want to watch the world burn"".The Joker is the star of the show. Everybody was right about Heath Ledger's last significant performance (He also starred in The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus which was released in 2009). He has given the world's best portrayal of The Joker since Jack Nicholson's version of The Joker in Batman (1989). Overall, the film is fantastic but it should be seen to be believed. Words can't do this movie true justice, but I hope this review helped anybody who's unsure about seeing the film. I can't recommend it enough.",1
"Story is exceptional, acting is exceptionable, action is exceptional, directing, music, cinematography and everything else is exceptionable.
It can be re-watched countless times, a must watch.",1
"There are so many movies take you by the heart, this one separates itself from the pack by having the special ability of moving you by showing that everyone's life is bitter whoever you are and whatever you do.The cooperation between Frank Darabont and Stephen ""the master of terror"" King is very welcome at every angle in every title they work together and The Shawshank Redemption is the peak of this collaboration. The story is the classical friendship in the most unexpected places with bitter twists found in most Stephen King stories. And the images and the camera angles are carefully and successfully designed and executed.The movie takes you in for 2 hours and 22 minutes of a ride in time and senses.",1
"This is a comedy. Although the audience did not share my sense of humor, I laughed throughout the movie. The opening visuals set the stage for a surrealistic journey. If you were not a schizophrenic when the movie began then you should be a bit schizophrenic when the movie ends. Do the terms withdrawal, hallucinations, delusions of persecution and omnipotence ring a bell? Brad Pitt gives an amazing performance. I particularly like when his face is covered in a cold sweat and he gives the speech ""You should not be judged...."" with steely conviction. Edward Norton is superb as the main character. He is so convincing that you find the ending mind blowing. In a lot of movies the hero and heroine walk into the sunset. I really liked the ending of this movie because they simply held hands and looked out the window of an office tower. It was one of the most romantic moments in the movies for an anarchist. I think it is about time that we see more movies that attack the establishment. This movie does that just fine thank you. Schizophrenia rules.",1
"best movie ever, i know it for sure, it is the best movie of the best, th best of the best, the one. there is no other like it, i can't think of other movie that can compete with its greatness, for real like @#$%, i mean it for sure, it's just like me, the best of the best, i'm serious!!! in love with this movie and Vlad, if you're reading this listen to me, it's the best movie ever!!!! i love it so much, i can bet you all that you haven't seen another movie like this one, Christopher Nolan rules !!! i love it and so do you, i love you, kisses, love love love!!!!

"First i see this movie i will always se e the assasin and i very like it 
this is movie my first time movie i ever watch",1
"Skilled thief DiCaprio gets what he needs by infiltrating his targets' subconscious. Can be a special-effects mess at times, but Nolan is able to execute the difficult task of keeping the audience on the same page as the plot despite the complexities of the storyline? unlike other sci-fi/action-thrillers (cough, MATRIX, cough). DiCaprio leads a cast of fellow young A-listers, and the actors don't crowd each other even though a lot of the characters don't actually have to be there (hush, hush; we'll pretend JGL actually serves a purpose here just because he's so cool). In Nolan we (continue to) trust? even when it comes to sci-fi.***½ (out of four)",1
"Three words to define ""Fight Club"": crazy, disturbing and BRILLIANT. The best movie i have ever seen. Lots of people won't like it though, because it's no more than big criticism on our society, on the way that we live. Congratulations on performances by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, both impressed me a lot.",1
"It's insanely brilliant movie
the idea of this film is wonderful and hard to be created
you must watch it more than one time",1
"The Shawshank Redemption(1994) is an American drama movie set in 1947 and spanning 20 years of two prisoners at Shawshank who survive the place with no hope of ever coming out, but one still thrives on the 'dangerous' but 'good thing'. Based on a novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King, the movie hooks you from its very first scene. An innocent person, Andy Dufresne is convicted for two life sentences, and in the prison, he meets Red, a man who have spent almost twenty years there, and one, who has been here as long as he can remember (50 years). With a life different from anything in the outside world, the movie takes you on a tour of life of these people where corruption, hypocrisy of religion and authority, friendship and enmity are hard to miss.Morgan Freeman as Red with a very natural acting, and Tim Robins as Andy Dufresne playing a young, bright and observant banker, the movie, written and directed by Frank Darabont has soothing background music and great cinematography.A must, must watch.",1
"An amazing film above, a fantasy-like scene brought to the screen, I can only say that this movie is too wonderful",1
"In 2005, Christopher Nolan relaunched Warner Brothers' dormant Batman franchise with ""Batman Begins"", an exceptionally well-made film that took a realistic, detailed approach to the origins of DC's biggest hero (arguably the most popular hero in the world). Now, three years later, Nolan and his star Christian Bale return to the property, and they deliver what is perhaps the greatest superhero film ever made (and a great film, besides), one that will become the model all others will look up to.The first movie ended on an optimistic note: Batman had saved the city, and had ""really started something"", in Gordon's words: however, one tease at the end (the Joker's playing card) hinted at the violent chaos to come in the next movie. And here, Nolan delivers on that, in the form of the late Heath Ledger, in a performance that is already becoming legendary. Gordon closed the last film with a prediction that Batman's presence would lead to escalation in the criminal community. He was right. The desperate Gotham mafia (a coalition of Slavic, African-American, and Italian gangsters) turn to the Joker to deal with Batman before he brings them all down. The Joker enacts a campaign of terror designed to smoke Batman out: the caped crusader and his chief allies, DA Harvey Dent and Police Commissioner Gordon (the first film's Commissioner Loeb is among the Joker's first victims), along with assistants Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox, must deal with this embodiment of chaos. Dent, as well, is romancing Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a superior replacement for Katie Holmes).Nolan and his screenwriters draw on several different comics sources to create their vision of Batman, the Joker, and Gotham. The most obvious among these are Alan Moore's ""The Killing Joke"" (perhaps the seminal Batman vs. Joker story) and Jeph Loeb's ""Batman: The Long Halloween"", which involved Harvey Dent and the struggle between Batman and the mob. Moore's Joker was conceived of as having no fixed origin, and Nolan follows throuhg with this: the Joker has no origin, though he offers several different versions to different people.Conversely, the film diverges noticeably from the comics in its depiction of Two-Face. There is no split personality in evidence, nor any of the psychological problems that said personality springs from. Two-Face has more or less been cut down to his gimmick, and then a new rationale for the gimmick constructed to suit the themes of the film. Eckhart is very compelling as this version, which also sports some effectively grisly makeup/effects.""Batman Begins"" was notable for being the first Batman film to really be about Batman, instead of being a showcase for various freakshow villains; this is dialled back a bit in this film, where the villains take more of a centre-stage. Batman still has a significant character arc, but the story is less about him; notice that the buzz surrounding the movie centres on Ledger, not Bale. That Batman is less of a focus is not a bad thing in and of itself, so long as the villains are well-done, which they are. Caine, Freeman, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal are all effective supporting cast.One of the most notable things about this film is its ability to make the audience doubt the outcome, bringing the storytelling styles that have flourished in the comics industry for at least twenty years to the big screen at last; Spider-Man succeeded in 2002 where he failed in the comics in 1973, but now the audience is never sure whether Batman's allies will reliably make it out alive. It's a jolt that one hopes will allow future comics adaptations to reach the greater diversity of outcomes that the comics currently enjoy.A bravura effort from all involved.",1
"A movie that will never leave your mind, demanding from you its regular revision. A mad, multi-level, impressive plot production, attached to the deepest actor images. Infinitely rich semantic context and visual component. All this is a combination of the greatest cinematic experience that Nolan dragged through all these years.",1
"A brilliant tense movie from the beginning to the end in which tells the story of the rising new menace in Gotham city known only as the Joker and how the Dark Knight has to reach his limits trying to control the havoc he breaks in Gotham city.The movie is an extraordinary piece of the filmmaking art in all its aspects, the plot is carefully and smartly written as a intricately wrought canvas, the character development is very satisfying, the movie was shot well and nicely directed, the epic score fits the scenes and add up to the whole visual experience, the acting was intense by all cast where each fit their role perfect",1
"I literally had no idea what this movie was about,I told my GF not to tell me anything about it and I didn't see the trailers. I saw it got a 9.4 with 20k views so I said must be good.The movie was so interesting and I am doing research to see if any of it is true. The End will stir debate, however I know for a Fact how the movie really ended or the truth if you will.The answer is this (not a spoiler) It is what it is. That's the answer, of course there's dialog that supports that answer about 5-minutes before the end and another point in the movie which i will not tell.Also if you pay attention to the flow of the movie you can answer the question you will have at the End as well.I will not say what the movie is about.",1
"In The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan convinces us that not all superhero movies have to be awful, you actually have to actively make them that way. In the hands of a good director, (some) great actors, and with a decent script, a really worthwhile movie can be made. All this without losing the appeal of the audience that normally migrates to these movies.While all of Nolan's three Batman movies are good, this one really stands out. There is more substance to this than the first one, and it doesn't descend into farce as the third does a little, but mostly it's a couple of standout performances. A lot is made of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, for good reason, but his equal is Aaron Eckhart, always great, who shines as Harvey. High quality support from Gary Oldman and the movie is lifted above all other superhero movies of the past 20 years.I struggled with how I felt about Christian Bale's Batman. I guess most Batman's are somewhat understated and I initially thought Bale was a strange choice that didn't work. However as I moved through the movies, I actually thought he bought the vulnerability to the role that he needed, as a very human Batman.",1
"This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.",1
"It is one of the best movies. Oh yeah, then I remind myself of The Dark Knight. I chose to give Inception 9/ 10 because giving it 10/10 will be equating it with The Dark Knight.Nolan's movies aren't for those with low concentration power. You need to be in the movie in order to keep pace with story. It is almost like studying for an exam. And this one is the toughest of them all.The best thing apart from good acting from all those involved is great script. It does not give you any chance to sit back and relax. You are pulled inside the movie. The pace at which the movie goes is enjoyable to watch.The important fact about this movie is that there is no stand out character like the Joker. Each character has been given equal importance and as a whole have done a splendid job.Christopher Nolan has taken great risk in making this movie. He is banking upon the audiences to be intelligent enough to enjoy the movie. You might hear reviews from friends saying that the movie is crap, I heard it myself, but let me tell you that it is a must watch. If you are the kind of movie buff who likes to see movie as an art and not just for actors and actions and other secondary things.If you are going to watch this movie make sure you go when you have nothing on your mind because you will need to focus on the movie.",1
"This movie got it all right and improved upon the story told in the novel. Every twist and turn goes the right way and comes at the right time. That's David Fincher for you. The pacing, the acting, the directing; it's all perfect. Everybody in the cast truly delivers their A game. The movie is smart, witty, self-aware, and doesn't take itself too seriously. From the very beginning the movie is telling you what is happening. Only when the characters themselves figure it out does the audience clue in. It is masterful story telling at its best that makes this movie viewable over and over. One can watch this movie 10 times and still discover new things to love about it.",1
"like ""The Shawshank Redemption,""The Green Mile"" is another case of a Stephen King story which translates well from the page to the screen.as in ""Mile"",this movie is also directed by Frank Darabont,who also wrote the screenplay.another similarity is the prison setting and the fact that the movie is seen and told through the eyes of one man (Morgan Freeman)who just happens to be a prison lifer and the things he sees as the years go by.he tells the story of one man who becomes a prisoner(TIm Robbins) and who he becomes friends with.the movie then chronicles their friendship and struggles in the prison system.unlike ""The Green Mile"",there is no mystical or supernatural element to this film.however,this film is of the same calibre of ""Mile"",owing to its solid writing, acting, and direction.""Shawshank"" is very dramatic,yet very compelling.it's also a very moving tale.it will likely impact you emotionally and intellectually. and before i forget,i must also mention the ending,which i thought was very strong.for me,""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a strong 10/10",1
I think this movie is very good for me. For not to follow the rules of the main rules in the word,1
"Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is one of the best film I've watched or ever will. A perfect film in each and every aspect. 'The Dark Knight' is a treat for a cinema lover, I was gripped, Stunned and Amused to see such a great film. Its the highest grossing film after Titanic, in my opinion it deserves to be at no.1.Performance Wise: Heath Ledger will live through his portrayal as The Joker. Giving him any award, can not be as high as his performance. He's fantastic. The best performance delivered in the History of Cinema. Bale as Batman rocks. Aaron is outstanding as Harvery Dent and even as the short-lived two-face. Maggie is good. Sir Michael Caine is amazing as Alfred. Gary Oldman is a legend, he's fab. Morgan Freeman is tremendous. Others also excel.'The Dark Knight' is one of the best film ever made. Cinema is proud to have a film like The Dark Knight. Two Thumbs Up!",1
Certainly a Nolan film where he takes the story way ahead and making people thing is it the way a city has to leave and Batman oh yes always a DC fan and he is the reason I have been a DCFan.,1
"Fight Club is funny, scary, messy, and imperfect, and there's a reason it continues to endure. It met us at a very strange time in our lives.",1
I Am Such A Huge Fan Of This Movie. I Can Watch It Over And Over Again. Leonardo Was Stunning And Did An Amazing Job Playing His Role. Inception Has It All To Thrill Romance Adventure. I Highly Recommend This Movie To Everyone And Anyone. Such A Good Eye Killer And Keeps You Glued To The Movie .,1
"I honestly couldn't have gone into a cinema with higher expectations, and I can openly admit that I didn't expect Inception to come even close to the bar I had set it, but, against all odds, it succeeded with flying colours. Inception is the story of a tormented man, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who with a team of experts, uses the technology they have to enter the subconscious mind, and steal the ideas that lie there, for money. So basically, a sci-fi type heist gang. Which, on paper, sounds intriguing, if but a little silly. However, Christopher Nolan pulls it off here with such a tremendous amount of energy and a somewhat complex although beautiful plot. The last hour in particular is literally incredible, I can say with full certainty that even a science fiction hater, will be on the edge of their seat. For me personally, it was the terrific blend of Cobb's forgotten life, the stunning special effects and the psychological essence that combines to make just an amazing movie.I know the film will be criticised for the idea of it trying to be the next Matix where reality is not all as it's seems. However, it is not like that at all, and Inception is entirely it's own movie, with it's own plot and set of characters who you emphasise with. In particular, I thought the cast did portray all their roles very effectively, with Marion Cottilard portraying Cobb's estranged wife Mal beautifully, as does DiCaprio, although he does need to spend less time frowning. I also think Joseph Gordon- Levitt and Cillian Murphury portray their roles effectively too. On the downside, Ellen Page is simply not convincing enough to take on the complexity of her character, as she just feels too young and inexperienced to play the clever Ariadane. I also have to admit that a few times the story does cross the line between complex but hooking, to a little silly, but it always manages to bounce back to keeping you on the ball again. But overall, it is one of the best, most fascinating, and down right incredible movies I have seen in a long time, and I just have to say well done to Christopher Nolan to creating such a masterpiece, and it is amazing to see a person who just manages to get better an better with each movie he makes.",1
"A movie worthy of the label, 'very good' _ but being number one out of all movies ever? No way, are you kidding me? One should go back to snacking on those wacky mushrooms _ please. Better yet let us all have some, those hallucinations need to be shared by one and all. It was a good movie...very good in fact. And without question, this is some quality entertainment. I really did enjoy the one time I saw it. I have to say though, I did not wet myself with glee when I watched the flick. It just seemed like the plot was far-fetched and a bit tiresome. The premise of good triumphing over evil is outstanding. It is too bad that the action of defining good and evil is clearly sitting outside the reality-room in 'Redemption.' 'Spoiler Alert' 'Spoiler Alert' Prison guards = bad and hardened criminals = bad? Why? I can understand Tim Robbins latching his wagon to this ridiculous notion _ but Morgan Freeman? Sorry it just doesn't compute. For me _ a very good movie _ but not a great movie. I will give this ""King"" drama an 8/10",1
"I can finally put the film in its proper context. When I first saw the movie, I went into it absorbing all the hype about how mind blowingly amazing it was and how it was an instant classic if not THE best film ever made. So I viewed the film in an intellectual frame of mind...and I loved it, but with some reservations. Firstly, I admired Bales performance much more then Heath Ledgers, who practically everyone said and continues to say stole the show. I thought he was an exceptional villain, but since he was a completely remorseless maniac, with even Ledger himself calling him a ""psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy"", I didn't know what to make of it. For a film that was going for ""realism""(as real as you can get with entirely foreign geographical locations like Gotham City and scientifically implausible devices and applications), having a brilliant, insane super criminal who somehow has limitless access to henchman and supplies, and can rig hospitals and ferry boats with explosives even when there is manhunt out for him right in the middle of a major metropolitan city seemed a little far-fetched. Didn't it? To buy in to the story, you have to accept that the various crime bosses and crooked business men have almost total control over Gotham. Of course corruption exists, look around you, but I just find it hard to believe that all the corrupt civil servants and mob members would have the ability to manipulate the entire city for the Jokers benefit.Anyway, what I really admired about the film was Batman himself. I see Batman as the ubermensch, I think he is human potential at its very peak, and I think Christian Bale did an outstanding job at it. He has emotions and deep feelings of love and compassion for people he cares about and the citizens of Gotham themselves. He is deeply touched that his Batman persona is actually making an impact in peoples lives, lamenting on crude vigilantes, yes, but relieved that he may one day retire from being Batman because of the new DA, Harvey Dent, who has been christened ""The White Knight"" of Gotham. He may get to relax and maybe spend time with his longtime crush, Rachael Dawes, but then the Joker enters the picture. Watching Batman become increasingly desperate to apprehend the Joker, whether through outright physical abuse, or abuse of technology(some sort of device to monitor peoples cell phones throughout the entire city simultaneously), it is actually a little disturbing to watch Batman become unhinged. What I also liked about Batman was something Henri Ducard told him in ""Batman Begins"": ""If you commit yourself to an ideal, you can become more than a man...a legend."" Batman has completely omitted himself to his code of ethics and morals, and built himself up to be the greatest human alive, look at how he easily evades the attack dogs late in the film. I think that any benefit we can get from superhero stories is how the hero can teach readers or viewers to reflect on these morals and apply them in real life, who doesn't want to be Batman? The Dark Knight makes me appreciate Batman Begins much more then I had previously, the former accentuates the good qualities of the latter and gives it focus, a sense that it is one part in a longer struggle.The supporting cast are all excellent. Aaron Eckhart played Harvey Dent, the third lead in the movie. While I thought the hospital room scene wasn't totally believable, I was honestly moved by Dent slowly moving into insanity because of the Jokers actions. Not when he laments about how his girlfriend was taken from him, but during subtler moments, like when he was talking to Jim Gordon in the hospital, you can see he is gone off the deep end. Or before that when he is going to kill an insane henchman of the Jokers, flipping a coin to decide his fate, I thought that was the most disturbing moment in the movie. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and every other actor actor involved are handle themselves greatly, there isn't a weak actor in the cast.Finally, after watching the film several times more, I finally see the greatness in the Joker. I have never seen Mr Ledger in another film before, so I couldn't appreciate how deeply he sunk himself into the role. The physical transformation is astounding, and he does play an insane mastermind to the absolute T, even if he doesn't seem right in a ""realistic"" world frame. He is charismatic and will certainly be remembered, and I see him as a Mephistopheles type character. Batman has always been a mythical story at heart, so why not embrace it? Congrats on your amazing performance Heath, you played pure evil and insanity in a great way, and I hope you somehow know how many fans you have down on Earth.I also give my heartfelt praise to the director, screenwriters(director Chris Nolan and his brother), cinematographer and everyone else involved. The movie has great dialog, a great and consistent plot, is a wonder for the eyes and is just fantastic all around as it explores different themes like pure evil, morality, order, human nature and more. It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is a very respectable effort. PS I would also like to compliament the action scenes and sick humor used by the Joker. The Dark Knight also works perfectly well as a straight action picture for those without minds(just kidding). It is just as exciting as the best action movie ever, Die Hard and the Jokers dialog, while twisted by his evilness, is also very funny",1
I really enjoyed watching the movie and the ending is just a remarkable one,1
The Movie well Played on screen with batman.It so attraction children for super hero flim,1
"I recommend everyone to watch this as long as you are 16+.This movie was life changing in some aspects, it was just that great, I have watched it well over 30 times and would watch it again today, if I felt like it.If you get the chance to watch it, watch it...and watch it again. 2 times will give you the gist and 3-5 times you generally have the whole idea of what the movie is about. It's very confusing but some will see what I mean if they have not watched it yet.If you agree with me, write a review, it's on my top 3, with American history x and requiem for a dream alongside it -- those movies are also really good watches as well.For anyone interested in a wake-up call movie or a brain teaser, this is for you, so, take an extra 2-3 hours out of your day and give this movie a watch as you won't regret it.",1
"This is the best movie I've ever watched!! It told a moving story very effectively. Former banker Andy Dusfresne is wrongly convicted for a double murder and sent to Shawshank Prison. The first few years are a struggle but he eventually carves out for a place for himself and benefits the other inmates in the process, winning favours through helping the guards and warden with financial planning and expanding the prison's meagre library. He becomes solid friends with Red, a black man who entered 20 years before and is highly resourceful. What resonates with the audience is Andy's clinging to hope. The saddest part was when the boy that Andy had been tutoring obtained a high school diploma, but shortly after, was shot dead under the warden's orders as he had knowledge that could prove Andy innocent. Following that, Red tells Andy that hope is a dangerous thing. Bur further events prove that hope is in fact a good thing (as Andy tells Red in a letter) - Andy escapes through a hole he dug in his cell wall (hidden behind a large poster of a hot woman) and escapes to Mexico using a false identity and cash that he'd procured while laundering money for the warden. Before leaving, he submits evidence incriminating the hypocritical warden. As the cross-stitching on the warden's office wall reads, judgment does indeed come! Red is released soon after and struggles to adapt to the outside the world. But for Andy's invitation to join him, Red would probably have gone down the path of Brooks, who committed suicide.The Shawshank Redemption combined a message of hope with wonderful storytelling and attention to detail. It's truly a masterpiece.",1
The story in this movie is excellent and combined with superb acting by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt this movie is taking it to another level. The way they describe modern society and the media. With a taste of communism and loneliness it makes you wonder for days about modern society and what it does to people.,1
This movie is like crafted by a omniscient being (Christopher Nolan). Thought-provoking. An absolute masterpiece.,1
"An excellent film. A lot of the credit for ""Fight Club"" I think should go to the writer of the novel Chuck Palahniuk. What a great way to talk about our modern day society. The film looks like your typical Hollywood popcorn blockbuster flick and has therefore a real mass appeal. But below the surface of a very well made thriller there is a not too hard to find subtext (at least the headlines of the subtext are not too hard to find) about our capitalistic society that everyone should be able to catch. I'm not sure if Fincher's stylization made the best possible movie out of this novel, but it definitely found the best possible middle course between mass appeal and message. Edward Norton is to be watched in the role that turned him into a massive star. And as he is one of the finest actors of his generation, to watch him is just a joy. David Fincher favourite Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden and is as iconic as the amazing Helena Bonham Carter in her part as Marla Singer.",1
"Many believe that the IMDb Top 250 list is quite bad and unrealistic. I partially agree. The trouble is that cult classics, that have passed the test of time, are mixed with the latest blockbusters that enjoy enormous but only temporary popularity. Many of these films have a high rating due to strong marketing and internet hype, and will disappear altogether within a few months or maybe a few years, but I think that the positions of the films that have been on the list for more than a decade, with little variation or without any, pretty much reflect their real quality. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" deserves the first place it holds.To me, this movie is just perfect. Great camera, masterful directing, a pace that makes two and a half hours simply fly by, top actors and their performances, well-integrated music, and most importantly Darabont's excellent adaptation of the King's story, make this film a timeless masterpiece. This prison story found the perfect balance between drama and humor, sadness and joy, alienation and friendship, malice and empathy, terror and hope. It can be viewed as an interesting adventure with a great plot twist, but also as a metaphor for life in general. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was nominated for seven Oscars, it is at or near the top of almost every list of best films of all time, it's Freeman's favorite own film, King's favorite adaptation of his own story, by far the best adaptation of King and, if not the best, certainly one of the best movies of all time. I saw it several times and not once have I been able to write about it right after watching. It simply leaves me speechless every single time.10/10",1
"This is a very good movie.
I watched this film with my family DETECTIVE story",1
Awesome movie. I like the story and all characters and also the technical aspects.,1
"You know what's funny? It took me 10 minutes to decide which quite I will use as a headline. There are just so many excellent in this one.
The Dark Knight is the closest thing we will ever witness to a flawless movie.
The movie is perfect in it's three acts, all the characters get to shine, the action scenes are amazing, the movie is amazing but what really separates this movie from a lot of other stuff is Heath Ledger's Oscar Performance, the dialogue and the philosophical questions behind it.
Since everybody has already gone in detail, It would be too long to say how awesome this movie was. It's the best Movie since The Shawshank Redemption and my personal third favorite movie ever!",1
"I don't like to say this often: ""I could not find a single flaw in this masterpiece of a movie"". This is not only, by far, the best Batman movie ever created, but also the best superhero movie ever created to date! Christian Bale as Batman has returned to the big screen and really amazed us with a Batman that is both believable and absolutely amazing. His pain and sorrow are clearly evident as he tries to cope with his role as ""The Dark Knight"" and he just plain kicks bad guys asses throughout the entire flick! Heath Ledger will forever be known as the Joker for me. He has far outstripped veteran actor Jack Nickolson as a far far better joker. I will give no spoilers, but the line ""Why So Serious?"" will be with me forever. Ledger deserves a posthumous Oscar for his performance.If you are a die hard Batman fan or a Batman newbie, there is something for everyone in this movie. None will be disappointed with the film. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. It is both dark and brooding. It is the perfect locale for such a film, Chicago that is.I just can't get over this movie. I think I am going to see it again in the theater later this week when the rest of my family goes, it is that great. Well worth the rising price of movie tickets!",1
"Chuck Palahniuck's Fight Club is a exciting, stimulating and surprising look at a typical macho porn (coincidence to porn, at the end of the movie, look real close for Brad Pitt's d***).  The movie circles around a man (a usual great performance by Ed Norton, who plays this man but is only know as narrator) who has a dead-end job and life until he meets a man played by Tyler Durden (played well by Brad Pitt) who convinces him that the best way to live is to beat each other senseless.  Soon a club starts, and a type of fascist society of fighting men are abound.  This film takes many turns, many odd ones at that, but it is cool, action packed, and sometimes even funny.  One of the best of the year and Fichner's best since Seven.",1
Christian Bale nailed the acting as a Batman and no one can replace him. No movie can replace this movie series. You want a master piece then you are welcome here at every aspect.,1
"this is the best film that has ever been made. No apologies to The Godfather: Great film, but this.... THIS is the culmination of perfect casting, narration, slowly-developing scenes, film score... There's not a single moment in the film that I can point to and claim that it ought to be different.? There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two. A MASTERPIECE.",1
"come on guys lets be serious.... its got an overall rating of 9.6? this places it at #1 in the all time ratings? now that is sheer madness... yes it is in fact quite an enjoyable movie, with a decent plot and with some great acting... heath ledger has done a phenomenal job with the joker... it was breathtaking at times... the rest of the cast do quite a good job as well especially the batman himself... however for a movie to be considered the best of all time it requires much more than great acting... and on many other fronts this movie, although reaching quite a high level, should not even be deemed one of the best movies, let alone the best movie, of all time... well thats my opinion anyways... and its a sad sad day that the godfather has lost its number one place...",1
"So i watched this film maybe 10 times Russian version, 5 original English. Read both book versions. It's beautiful story! When i have watched this film first time, after started to follow the career of the actor Morgan Freeman. He is a great actor. I give the film 10 stars",1
"the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest film's ever made in my time and i love it.",1
The movie is a masterpiece when it comes to the story line. The ending itself gives away a shout of freedom. The cast was spot on movies like Shawshank are a rarity these days. A must watch!,1
"Dom Cobb (Leo DiCaprio) and his assembled team enter the minds of people to steal their deepest secrets. This time, his ""last"" time, He is asked not to steal anything, but plant an idea, something which some people say is impossible to achieve.Wow. I very rarely come out of the cinema speechless, but this was truly mesmerising. The plot has many twists, turns and layers, but is not overly confusing. It's confusing enough to make you want to see it again, and have discussions with friends afterwards, but not so much that it would alienate you - the perfect balance.Nolan has created his piece de resistance. All of the cast put in exceptional performances - especially DiCaprio, who I used to be a huge critic of.The score by Hans Zimmer creates a constant ""edge of your seat"" tension as to what is going to happen next. Even for his standards, a musical masterpiece.The cinematography - just unbelievable. I constantly was mesmerised, amazed, confused and delighted all at the same time! There have been a few films to tackle the ""dream versus reality"" theme in recent years. The Matrix films come to mind, and there are some comparisons. But this is a very different film, and maybe unfair to compare. Vanilla Sky was another, and this just walks all over that for an idea and a completed work.A work of art (without being pretentious - it really is!) Go and see it at all costs, as many times as you can afford.",1
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.",1
"Same az Mr robot series theory. The main story is same but, thay published it in diffrent ways",1
"This fight club is like a flight club, I love it and can't stop thinking about it. I watch it day and night, non-stop.. for 24 hours, I think I'm INLOVE! keep up the amazing work,",1
"Just stop. Joke aside, this a film that has to be watched. Acting, brilliant, script, brilliant, direction, brilliant. Critique of Ikea culture, brilliant.",1
"Since I'm about the same age as the film itself, I was never able to see the ads for the movie and see if I'd like to watch it. But seeing as how I loved Brad Pitt and action movies I decided to take a chance and watch it. The whole movie is fabulous, and the fact that there is a mind-screwing plot that you don't realize until the end is absolutely amazing. While you feel you understand the movie from start to finish, you get completely set back near the end and have to rethink what is really true about the film.Both actors Norton and Pitt were wonderful for the roles, and I feel like Norton played a perfectly insane person; it was amazing.",1
NO MATTER BATMAN OR JOKER THEY ALL HEROS!EVEN I LIKE JOKER MORE!,1
"... I really loved Inception. It was one of those really cool movies that broke my 12 year old conceptions of the dreams I was seeing. Highly effective and all. Now in retrospect, as the 17 year old me thinks about this film, it was still great, but not as amazing as I used to think perhaps. The ending was way more predictable then I thought it was, and there certainly were a couple of plotholes.But nevertheless, I trust my 12 year old self. If she enjoyed it, then there was something about Inception. At least it captivated me, whether it was music, scenery, DiCaprio's acting or just the fact that it posed a new mystery for me. Oh yes, when I was younger I especially loved stuff that I would watch and not understand. That explains also why I loved Cloud Atlas and The Fountain. Something I thought was very really deep.Now unfortunately it's gotten more difficult to impress me. I wish at times I still had that spark in my eyes when watching such movies:)",1
"If you're an avid Batman fan or even interested in a grounded story based in a ""comic"" universe. This movie is a must see and will match all hype or expectations you may have.",1
"David Fincher pulls out all the cinematic tricks in Fight Club. We get long shots that pull out from deep within a character, and I do mean deep and we get reality distorted so much that when reality comes back into focus, it's almost like getting slapped in the face.  It's hard to talk about Fight Club without giving away its surprises.  All I can say is see, it for yourself.  The movie is complex and you'll be thinking about it after you've left the theater.  Brad Pitt is at his best when he plays unhinged characters.  Here, he gets to be unhinged and I think he's perfect in this role.  He gets to be a bad boy and we revel in all of his guerilla tactics.  I liked the trick he does while working at a movie theater.  For all of the violence in Fight Club, there is only one death.  None of the brawlers fight to the death.  They might get beaten to a bloody pulp, but they live to fight another day.  What do you expect from a movie that's called Fight Club?",1
"I'd make this review in points.1.From the side of directing,every thing is amazing an terrific-all cadres are impressive and his way is very sensible and effective.
2.Nolan's way doesn't make you feel bored..his way push you to think and think and think a lot-absolutely he is on of the most professional and great directors nowadays.
3.In this film Nolan doesn't depend on the performance of the actors more than the way of directing and of course the script and terrific story.
4.A very advanced technology is used in the scenes and was very amazing.
5.Finally, i think this is the best movie of that type you can see.",1
"This is by far the best character drama I have seen. The acting is believable and powerful, the shots are perfectly framed, the story is interesting and keeps you hooked, and the comedy, while in short supply, is appropriately dark. Andy Dufresne is a relatable protagonist, and thus it is easy to connect with his struggles, and understand how he feels about being thrown into the life of a convicted criminal. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give us incredible performances, along with everyone else in the movie. On top of that, the ending is one of the best ever put on screen. I would recommend this film to everyone who likes the industry, and consider it a must-see cinematic classic.",1
Now I've never been a huge Batman fan but this movie just takes the cake! Never have i seen such performances by the actors especially Heath Ledger. This guy's performance was just out of this world. In my opinion he puts the other Jokers to shame. I bow down to his performance. The others were good as well with Christian Bale and Michael Caine being as good as they were in Batman Begins. Applause as well of course to the director Christopher Nolan for being the backbone of this film. This film has to be at the top of my favourite films of all time. This film my opinion has indeed lived up to its hype.Overall Score: 100000 out of 10,1
"This is probably one of the best films of all time.IMDb ranks this best film of all time.It can arguably be the best film of all time considering that its message of hope and inspiration to everyone.It is a short story from Stephen King.The Shawshank Redemption is a poignant story of Andy Dufresne,a wrongly convicted killer who was sent for two life sentences to Shawshank Prison in Maine.It tells us on how Andy lived inside the walls of the Shawshank,being raped from time to time by convicted homosexuals felons,his friendship with Red,having a sense of hope despite of his seemly hopeless situation,making the most of his life by using his accounting skills by helping the guards in their income tax and cleaning the warden's dirty money and to finally escaping from prison through a hole in the wall hidden under poster of women such as Rita Hayworth and Rachel Welsh.Great acting especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Direction was superb by first time director Frank Darabont.The musical score was also good.I view this film from time to time to remind myself that there is hope in all situations even those I consider hopeless ones.It also a story of letting go of hatred and letting love flow into your heart despite of being around despicable characters.Aside from that,this film is neither contrived nor manipulative as it is full of surprises.It will truly be enjoyed by anybody who love great films and those who wants films that can truly uplift the human spirit.In the end,this movie will be talked about for the next 20 to 50 or more years to come.Personally it my favorite film of more than a thousand films I seen in my life for it is a classic film on hope and redemption.",1
"To begin, I want to make it absolutely clear no matter what you read in the following article, go and see Inception. Christopher Nolan has been polluting the airwaves for over 10 years now with fantastic movies such as 'The Dark Knight' for action fans, 'Insomnia' for fans of psychological thrillers, and 'Memento' for those who like to think about a movie, a lot. But then steps forward Inception, Nolan's true masterpiece. It's nothing less than perfect. Like a combination of all his life's work, like everything up to this point have been mere obstacles he had to manoeuvre in order to make this fantastic piece of work. The plot is so difficult to explain that it would take an entire page just to make a dent, so lets say there's a man called Cobb (Leo DiCaprio) who steals things, he's a thief. Now lets say he can some how go into people's dreams and there thoughts. But in order to make a more engrossing and action packed story, lets say this time, he has to plant an idea. That's the very basics of what can only be described as, the most complicated, but monumentally brilliant story every created. The entire mythology Nolan has created around the dreamscape can only be compared to what other film makers did with the rules of time and space. The amazing amounts of thought and creativity that has gone into every little detail is incredible on it's own, but when you plan to make a movie based AROUND this idea, not ABOUT it, then you cross the border into pure Godliness. The only flaw that you can possibly spot within this labyrinth of a movie is however, the characters and their complete lack of story and depth. All apart from the main character, Cobb, they share equal amounts of restricted screen time as Nolan rightfully realised that in order to harness the story's true power, you need to focus on the story itself, rather than split it off into tangents every 5 seconds. Characters such as Ellen Page's curious architecture student Ariadne and Tom Hardy's truly magnificent Eames are used merely as pawns by Nolan to tell this epic and infatuating tale of sub-conscious dreaming, and so, they receive very little to no back story what so ever, leaving us the audience to work this out for ourselves. A very ballsy but spot on move from Nolan as we do start to generate feelings for these bare-bones projections and any back stories apart from Cobb's (which is the key to the entire plot) would have crippled the excitingly fast pace of the movie. There's barely a moment in the entire 148 minutes when something wasn't being explained or dreams weren't being explored meaning Incepion is a movie you have to keep both eyes on at all times. Miss one thing, even a little tiny explanation of a very small section of the dreamscape, and you could end up completely lost. It is because of this (the incredibly engaging plot) that when the credits roll and you are now forced the peel your eyes from the screen, the previous 148 minutes seems so real and so engaging, that the movie in itself felt like a dream. And an outstanding one at that. Inception manages to make Nolan's previous work look like a children's cartoon as far as complexity is concerned and acting-wise, it's pretty much on the same level. DiCaprio's leading performance is a very emotionally aware and painfully focused one and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy all put in fantastic performances also, but the fact is, they didn't have to. Their believable acting is just another satisfying tick on the clipboard, not a requirement as the story takes over the entire audience's attention. Sure if they had been really bad it would be noticeable, but they could have portrayed their roles in a more Hollywood-style fashion and nobody would have realised. It is for this reason that I believe the actors are the hidden gem of this complicated maze of a picture. To conclude, Inception may be the most complex and engaging films you see all year, and if you focus purely on the movie itself and don't get distracted, it should be the best too. To me, Inception is Nolan's masterpiece and serves as a much needed kick-up-the-arse to the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich. This is how you make a movie boys... start taking notes!10/10",1
"With expectations so high for Christopher Nolan after a movies like 'Memento', 'Batman Begins' and 'Dark Knight'; it is undoubtedly one of the best ever made in the history of film making. Just when Dark Knight made you feel that this is the best any movie can ever get, Nolan raises the bar even higher and gives ""INCEPTION"" to the world. He not only surpasses his own personal best but also the likes of the movies like 'Avatar' which has huge gained audience in recent times. The sheer perfection of this movie has blown the world away. ""What's the most resilient parasite? An Idea. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules. Which is why I have to steal it.""Never in the past has any movie combined visual effects and intelligence in such excellently directed action scenes combined with visual effects that can make your jaw drop with a high but perfectly balanced shot of intelligence and imagination. In the past we have witnessed many unidirectional movies have shown grace only in visual effects ('Transformers' etc) or story ('Blind Side', 'Up In the Air') but no director has ever achieved the perfect mixture like Nolan did. Despite containing so much in the movie (action, drama, intelligence, thrill, maths, physics etc), it was smooth like a Symphony. Nolan prepared this with so much precision that you won't find any abrupt transition between action sequences and visual effects. This genius director has the ability to present his vision in such graceful manner demonstrating his powerful skills. He takes movie making to a whole new dimension ! His imaginative thoughts and increasing desire for perfection is making the world hungry for more. He defines Perfection!Inception has so much material and at the right pace to keep you at the edge of the seat for the entire duration of this masterpiece. Some scenes can even throw you off the seat. It will grip your attention like a strong magnet to a nail leaving you helpless but to watch and keep wondering of what will sweep you away next. One can't stop feeling gratitude for life to be honored by this movie. When it ends, you are bound to plan the next watch just for relishing the great work. Leo, my boy, was as the world knows him, One of the best actors to have lived in this era. And it is his aura that provokes the people around him to starve for achieving higher. Although his performance was better in 'Shutter Island' but he still was the best of the lot. After all it is he who sets high standards for the viewers to expect. A great balance between emotions has always been his key strengths. Over the years he has perfected his acting making him the ideal cast for a high profile movie like Inception. In fact, all the star cast was great. Ellen has evolved into a fine actress to join the league of Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard and Ken Watanabe.The sets and locations used in the movies are splendid. To be shot in 6 countries and such expensive sets is an achievement in itself. Combined with an Original, complex and imaginative script gives you an idea of the wonders Nolan is capable of doing when he is in the drivers seat. Its like he can talk to cameras placing them at correct locations and being able to shoot such striking shots proves his exemplary skills. The music is so good that it complements every aspect of the movie making it such a pleasure to watch. Hans Zimmer has indeed done a great job. His vivid ideas of venturing into the human mind has never been attempted in such a profound way. I can't help but wonder the kind of genius involved in coming up with a concept. The visual effects and action sequences are original and new which is something we have been missing for a long time. It is in fact so different that I won't be surprised if a book is written from this epic. Nolan surpasses the likes of Steven Spielberg and James Cameron becoming probably the most gifted directors in Hollywood history. I read someone's comment somewhere which stated that, ""If Nolan doesn't get an Oscar for best direction then there is something seriously wrong with the awards"" and I totally agree with this. It is just a matter of time that Oxford and Cambridge realize the necessity to add a new word to their dictionary. One which represents as a synonym to perfection and the ability to sweep people of their feet by one's genius. Maybe then it will make sense when I say, ""I am one of the millions who has been NOLAN'ed !!!""",1
"I never seen the Movie like This Before.. So, Its Really Cool Movie. Thank you all..",1
"This is a film about people and the choices they make, the choices that are made for them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman take the viewer on a roller coaster of emotions ride attempting to help the viewer understand their world, a prison world. It is made pretty clear early on that their world and our world are very different from one another but due to exquisite writing and equally exquisite acting we (the viewer) get to see the horrors of Shawshank prison, and even thought everyone is guilty (to one extent or another) you can't help but feel a certain kinship with the two main actors and to even some of their less companions. I read the Novella on which this movie was based and the movie is every bit as good and the book which is a testament to Frank Darabont's directing and screen writing abilities. The film is about Corruption abuse of power the human spirit, redemption and humanity and there is a reason it is # 1 on IMDb's top 250 list. it is well conceived, well written, well acted and well paced, it is the kind of film that even when you have seen it a dozen time and it is late, when you stumble upon it while channel surfing you still can not help but stop and watch it till the end credits, it is just a fantastic film from start to finish.",1
"I knew this movie for years before i watched it recently, and i can't help but thinking about it to motivate myself, since this movie is especially about the true power of mind and body. The story of a man who discovers that there is no cure to his insomnia. One thing after the other, he will meet dangerous people and will do bad things, he will learn about himself and become someone else, someone he always wanted to become. when his flat burns out, he asks his new friend for some help. This one accepts, but only at one condition: he must hit him. Fighting in front of a bar, two guys see them and, together, they create the Fight Club, which fights occurs in the basement of the bar. t It's smart, funny, and, sometimes, so clever and well-thought, you forget the rawness of the whole movie, and you just follow the story that goes very, very far...! Edward Norton is so great, so entertaining, and Brad Pitt is also so, so truly a legendary actor! And even though i've found, i think, some mistakes in the movie, it doesn't prevent me from loving it and saying to the people around me that Fight Club is one of the best film ever made. At one point, it just plays with your mind and tricks it. See it! Go see this movie!",1
i saw this movie when i was 16 years old. its such a so good movie :P i saw this movie when i was 16 years old. its such a so good movie :P i saw this movie when i was 16 years old. its such a so good movie :P i saw this movie when i was 16 years old. its such a so good movie :P i saw this movie when i was 16 years old. its such a so good movie :P,1
This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.,1
awesome movie...the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb...one of my favorite movies...!!! I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it. this is one movie that took over my mind for many days. It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movie's can be made in this way also.so I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this film.hats-off to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a century.lets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film.,1
"This is the perfect movie of all( i havent watch yet the godfather), the action in the movie is to damn awsome, all actors( from Leonardo Dicaprio to Tom Hardy) makes an perfect performing of all their characters, the plot is one of the plots of all time, but the best thing, the best thing about this movie is its the ending, for me it is one of the best endings of all time. Watch it, you will love it( meaby not more than avengers endgame but whatever)",1
"the book was absolutely genius and of course the movie is too! this movie is so whacked and also so interesting, that you don't know whether to laugh or to cry at the end, and whether the end is disastrous, catastrophic or very pretty! it was an experience watching this one! it actually has a very strange mixture of extremes: a band of stressed people that develop a very very dangerous and strange hobby that turns into a sort of religion, a schizo who is brain damaged and doesn't even know it, the most weird love-hate relationship you have ever seen and the most weird, dubious and scary characters put together in just one movie..but it remains a very original and exciting film to watch...what can i say....if it's Edward Norton, it's bound to be a good movie!",1
"Dark,unique and a complete mind shaking
This movie is the greatest movie of all time
It's durection, acting of Pitt and Norton and it's unique plot with a twisted ending",1
Will the 2020's bring something like this? Will a movie like this come out ever again? This is a masterpiece. A work of art.,1
"Well-acted, well-directed, powerful and thought-provoking, The Shawshank Redemption encompasses all of the above, as it tells the incredibly inspiring story of friendship and hope. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine in their roles as inmates who develop a remarkable bond during their imprisonment, facing the struggles of prison life together and ultimately finding redemption. Although it focuses on a very familiar theme, The Shawshank Redemption stands out from the rest of the films in its genre, mainly due to the extremely intimate portrayal of its characters it has to offer. The film successfully uses its prison setting as a lens for society, and manages to present the audience with important life lessons throughout the storyline. Although not designed as a film of epic proportions, its nature does have an immense emotional impact on the viewer, which makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films of all time.",1
I really like this Awesome Movie! I really like this Awesome Movie! I really like this Awesome Movie!,1
"After watching this masterpiece, i shouted... How I missed that!!!",1
"its one of the I liked the first Blade film if slightly. It was a fun movie with some very cool moments, but didn't live up to the hype. The third, 'Trinity' is a mind-numbing disaster. Oh the difference a good director can make! Guillermo del Toro (Cronos, Hellboy) has the reigns here and clearly had a good time with the movie: it briskly bounces from one energetic action sequence to the next, with a fair number of frightful sights thrown in to liven things up. This is a good thing -- with a wafer-thin plot that takes enough turns to keep your attention, Del Toro knows exactly what kind of movie he's making: a pure action flick. And he delivers the goods. The movie is dripping with cool, and while it may not be a classic, it's a fun flick to throw on and let it suck you in.",1
"This is one of my favorite all-time movies. An original story/script with a truly surprising twist written by Chuck Palahniuk (the book is also just a well-read), perfect directing by Fincher and a fantastic cast - Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helen Bonham Carter played imo the roles of their life. Like Matrix one of the top movies of the 90s and one of those movies who will stand the test of time like Ben Hur, Gone With The Wind and other exceptional pieces of movie-making.Great art and a must-see at least for everyone who likes to watch movies with an unconventional story (I watched it at least a dozen times.)",1
Ts amazing good keep it up and touch the sky and thats your great and biggest disteny,1
"Every part of Fight Club is brilliant. From the acting of Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter to the directing of Fincher, it's all amazing. The plot / story is so thick and engaging there is a lot to take in and may take a few watchings to fully comprehend what exactly you just saw, but it's truly magnificent and everyone should see this film for what it is about; People, more pointed towards men though, and the demoralizing way we have become ""weak"" and gotten so far away from our natural instincts because of the way the world works now. Best way to fix that? Get into a fight of course. But there is so much more to it then just fighting someone - it's deeper than that and simply superb in it's ability to get the point across. It does stray from the book a bit, but it needs to, but luckily doesn't leave anything major out. Like I said before, everyone should see this movie at least once. It never got the respect it deserved, or the credit.",1
"No Marvel film will ever be able to top this no matter how good they are. In fact, no superhero movie will ever be able to top this. This is the greatest comic book and superhero movie ever made and my fourth favorite film of all time. In fact, you can actually see it on my profile in my favorites list.Firstly, Heath Ledger's Joker performance. This is the best villain performance of all time. He raises the bar for other Joker's so high that it is impossible to reach. And you have to consider at the time Heath Ledger would have been the last person people expected to play The Joker. Before this, he had only really been in 10 Things I Hate About You, A Knights Tale, The Patriot and Brokeback Mountain. Jack Nicholson had already owned the role in 1989 and no one believed anyone could ever be able to outdo him. In fact, no one believed that he could even outdo him. And now, i don't know anyone who would ever put Nicholson or Hamill over him. But the saddest part is that Ledger died before this film even came out. Yet, that doesn't even overshadow his performance. Whenever you see Heath Ledger as the Joker you don't immediately think of his death, you think of the outstanding performance. The opening scene with all the men in masks being taken out one by one until the Joker is last is a legendary scene. When he slams the persons head down onto the pencil, you laugh but at the same time get chills. He can be funny while at the same time creepy. Then, the 'Why so Serious?' scene. Him holding the knife to the guy's mouth and telling the story of how he got his scars. The entire scene proves why he is the best joker and is definitely one of the highlights of the film. Some parts of the film you actually agree with him on as well. Especially, the part where he mentions that people with higher power seem more valuable to protect than soldiers. That's worryingly true.Now because Ledger is so good, it actually overshadows some of the other performances. While they aren't as good as his, i still think they make the film what it is. Gary Oldman is yet again brilliant as Gordon but my second favorite performance in the film is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. This one is definitely overlooked. The idea of Harvey Dent being the white knight who falls to darkness is played off brilliantly by Eckhart and i loved his take on Two-Face as well. He manages to play two completely different roles in the same film and do it to the best of his ability. You could actually see where he is coming from and the scene where he holds Gordon's son at gunpoint was so dark but yet so powerful and his performance makes the scene as a whole. He also says my favorite film quote of all time...
""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""
A line that means so much in the film and is repeated at the end, proving it's purpose. In fact, the scene at the end where Batman says that he will take the blame for Harvey's crimes. Making the ultimate sacrifice for Gotham. The city that Batman loves and will never abandon. When Gordon is taking apart the Bat symbol, you can see the pain in his face. Taking part the only thing he trusts so much in Gotham city. It proves why Batman is actually a superhero after all. He is willing to be seen as the bad guy just to stop the people from fearing each other. It kinda makes you think doesn't it, would Superman do that? I liked how Gordon told the public that Dent was 'not the hero they deserved but the hero they needed' while deep down he knew Batman was 'the hero they deserved, but not the hero they needed.'Christian Bale is great as Batman yet again but i have to admit his voice is kinda weird. If he didn't have such a strange voice he probably would have been my favorite Batman. Gotta give it to Keaton tho. Maggie Gyllenhaal is actually really good in her role. In fact, she was better than Katie Holmes. No disrespect to Katie Holmes but Maggie definitely seemed more professional and kinda suited her character in this one. And when she died i actually felt some emotion which i probably wouldn't have if it was Holmes instead. It's kinda sad if you think about it that Bruce didn't really have much time to mourn. He lost the only thing he still really loves in his life and yet he had to move on quickly and protect the city from the man who killed her. While Harvey Dent, a man who had just been dating her for a few months, became evil because of it. And the fact that his face was split in two. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are yet again really good and i liked to see Cillian Murphy return for a scene.So, before i end this review here are a few of my favorite things that i missed out on before.
1. The Joker walking on while there were many explosions in the background. The ultimate villain moment!
2. The scene on the boat. The tension you felt when watching both of them decide. The prisoner who made you believe he was going to blow the ship up but instead threw it out of the window is a great moment that is normally overlooked. The fact that the guard had let him do it and the prisoner had more human decency than him was a great reflection of the corruption in Gotham city.
3. The stunning cinematography, amazing soundtrack combined with great action scenes proves why it is considered as one of the all time greats.
4. The poster is actually my favorite poster of all time. Not the one that it shows on Letterboxd but the one with the burning bat logo in the Wayne industries building has a great color tone and almost gives away what happens in the subtlest way.
5. The foreshadowing at the start with Harvey flipping a coin and leaving it up to chance.Anyway, this film is an outstanding achievement by Christopher Nolan and will always be known as the perfect Batman movie. Along with the greatest superhero movie of all time.

R.I.P Heath Ledger",1
"I've had an evening to 'attempt' to put my thoughts in a semblance of 'order'. Don't pardon that pun, it is fully intended.The Dark Knight transcends the concept of a 'Super hero movie'. It stands alongside carbon deposits as an iron mountain. Without being bombastic, delivers an experience of such incredible magnitude that other titles claiming to be such are entirely translucent in comparison.Gotham City is no longer obvious sets and sound stages and blatant special effects and models in the midst of real time suburbia. Gotham City is living and breathing, from its skyscrapers to the liquor bottles in bars to the cops on patrol, of which there are many. It's not Tim Burton dark, but that's just fine. It's far more realistic, and as such far more believable, and therefore far more powerful when the stakes in the film become all too obvious.Batman is no longer a upcoming crusader, he is ready and confident in his ways, and feared by the criminal underworld. Indeed, such is his effect on the crime networks of the city that the big scary dog has withered to the scared and desperate puppy that thinks twice before barking.Then all of a sudden 'Enter the Clown Prince'. Heath Ledgers performance as the deranged criminal mastermind cannot easily be put into words. To call it 'acting' would somehow be selling it short. Ledger becomes an embodiment of a new age Joker. It would be wrong to make any comparison to Jack Nicholsons Joker, a sublime Batman Comic book realisation. Ledger takes it to a new level. His maniacal laugh and his calculating anarchic, psychotic disposition are not only a match for are Dark Crusader, they raise the bar of morals and integrity and strike deep chords within his being.When everything you have ever known and loved, and worked for is in jeopardy .. what do you have left to bargain with? What use is brute force and intimidation against a laughing antagonist who has field, and plays it with no limitations.Performances all around are strong, and I was surprised by Eckhard, of whom I was the most uncertain. Bale and Caine and Freeman and Oldman as always carry the weight of the film. With effective supporting performances by Maggie(Dawes) Gylenhall and Eric (Maroni) Roberts. The real star of the show, well, I don't really need to continue with that one, now do I? :)The Dark Knight is an IMAX experience. The smaller screens will still entertain, but for the real scope of this feature, IMAX is the real McCoy.Forget what you thought you knew, forget anything that has tried and fallen flat and hard. Go an experience The Dark Knight. Popcorn is nice, but taking your eyes off the screen is not recommended.",1
Already saw the movie but came back here because the trailer is still so awesome,1
"When i first heard about this movie i believed it was just another hyped up big budget movie, i was completely wrong. This movie is easily Nolan's greatest work of art. The acting and script for Inception is stunning. For him to make this movie very complex yet easily understandable is simply brilliant. From start to finish i was on the edge of my seat along with everyone else in the theater and was extremely pleased with the ending. This was the first movie to leave me utterly speechless after leaving the theater. This is definitely one movie you should see in theaters. I can't imagine this movie not winning film of the year because it is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.",1
"I have heard people complain that this film is 'too violent' or 'too focused on blood and gore'. If you that, you have missed the entire point of this great adaptation (the book is exquisite!). Its about self against self in a world devoid of utopian ideals and real reality. Id versus ego with love, lust, blood and destruction mixed in! You need to view several times to even come close to grasping the scope of this film!",1
"This is possibly the best superhero movie ever made.It asks very fundamental questions about the nature of good and evil.There are three characters-one is the epitome of goodness,the second one the ultimate anarchist, and the third is the ""Dark Knight"".Unike standard superhero movies,the evil is so strong here that it can entice the good and crumble the faith of all who believe in the good.The standard notions of 'heroism' are thrown to the dust as the 'hero' of the people becomes not a victim, but a slave of evil.And in the midst of the fire and chaos and madness, the real protector stands firm, watching over his city..because his job is not just to protect lives or property but something much bigger than all of these-the faith of people in good.The entire battle between batman and joker in this movie is for the survival of that faith..Fantastic acting (with special credit to Heath Ledger's masterpiece Joker)and a superb background music adds to the greatness of this movie.A must watch for anyone who wants the answer to ""what really is a hero?'",1
"Christopher Nolan is back with his second entry in his Batman trilogy and this is the one that defines the triogy and every Batman movie. The second entry in the trilogy follows a more darker and edgier story than the first entry Batman begins and the story between The Joker and Batman is the most interesting dynamic between a villian and hero put into film and the way that the joker and his morals conflict with Batmans perectly which becomes the best part of the movie. Also the development of Harvey Dent as a character is another stand out in the movie and the way that he goes from a man who is doing everything to pretect the city he loves to be willing to let the entire city burn and the way that two face perfectly made from good to bad he is so much better that the previous two face that was put to screen.
Christian Bale is back as Bruce Wayne/ Batman and for me this was the preformance of Batman that made me think that Christian Bale was made for the role of Batman and he has such a powerful convincing preformance.
The late great Heath Ledger plays the Joker and again this is the case of he was born to play this role and you can see that he really gets inside of the head of the chatacter and while everyone loves the Jack Nicholson Joker Heath Ledger is just so much better and understands the anarchy that the joker can cause.
Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent/ Two Face now he could be the main villian of The Dark Knight because he is such a compelling and interesting vilian he fights corruption and then ultimately becomes the corruptiom that occures in the film and is find that very interesting.
also in the cast is Michael Caine {Alfred}, Maggie Gyllenhaal {Rachel}, Gary Oldman {Gordon}, Morgan Freeman {Lucius Fox},Monique Gabriela Curnen {Ramirez} and Cillian Murphy {Scarecrow}.
Now if i had one complaint about The Dark knight it would be that they used Scarecrow when i don't think that they needed to use him i feel as if they cramed him in and then he was sorta just there but he didn't really feel like he had a place in this movie and that's really disappointing.
But while there is bad there is a positive well lots of possitives like the love triangle between Bruce Harvey and Rachel was a very interesting part and it develops the characters very well. Lucius Fox and Bruces friendship develops and he ends up be of great value to Bruce in the final act and he has become such a loved caharacter because he is so loyal to Bruce. From a technical stand point the cinematography was beautiful and has been through out the entire trilogy and the fight choreography was amazing as well and again was great through the entire trilogy.
overall this is one of my favorite movies and favorite comic book movies of all time and it is one of the best movies of the 2000's and thats why i give it 9/10",1
"There has never, nor will there ever be a movie more inspiring, more true, or more in your face! Thats right, The only people that don't like this movie are, the khaki stuck up want to be movie criticts!So go see it and decide for yourself. Not what everyone else wants you to believe.",1
"A masterpiece from any angle ,Directing , Acting ,Music , Cinematography",1
"Saw the movie today and I cannot get it out of my head; this is an incredible movie. Intense. Thought-provoking. I was drawn in and on the edge of my seat from the first scene to the last, and Christopher Nolan wisely followed the old stage advice to ""leave them wanting more."" Everything you've heard about Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" was deserved; he's iconic, he steals the show, and he is one of the most frightening villains I've seen since Kevin Spacey's killer in Seven, or Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal in Silence of the Lambs. Honestly, I'm hoping I don't have nightmares. And yet he still makes you laugh; believe me, you'll be glad for the comic moments amid one grisly criminal rampage after another. And it's not so much about his sadistic killings, which are mercifully barely off-screen most of the time. It's about what he says...his delivery; the creepiness and absoluteness of his anarchy. This is an intellectual Joker, yet a frightening mystery. For example, he enjoys rattling off varying, horrifying stories explaining his famous facial scars, and the audience doesn't know what to believe. And that's the point. You never know what he's capable of doing next.Maggie Gyllenhall puts Katie Holmes to shame as Rachel Dawes, and she's believable as a prematurely wizened, toughened young assistant D.A. Aaron Eckhart is excellent in playing the subtle ambiguities of a Harvey Dent walking a thin moral line even in the early stages of his moral crusader-ship, when he has just one face; bring your barf bag for his slide into a wicked transformation. Bale can do no wrong in my eyes, and here he gives another impressive turn providing a brooding and conflicted anchor to the story as a Bruce Wayne who's not sure he wants, or that Gotham needs, the burden of Batman. Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Michael Caine as Alfred, all put in the expected solid supporting performances that make this film's core character group seamless.The play between morality and anarchy, or chaos and order (both sets of images are alluded to by the characters), is the core to the conflict between Batman and Joker in the film. We wonder if the Joker's seemingly sincere caveat at the beginning of the film that the criminal underworld should ""Kill the Batman"" might just be a ruse; we find that the Joker might just very much need and want the Batman around (he's too much FUN!). He's an excellent foil for the Joker's ingeniously sadistic criminal scenarios, meant to taunt society's and Batman's moral notions of right and wrong, played out with human lives as simply collateral damage. The superb writing gives us a lot of dialogue from the Joker and Batman about this conflict, and it's going to make you think, folks...amid the carnage anyway.Know that the film is LOUD, and the pace and action relentless. I suppose it's true genre is Tragedy. It is intentionally ""Dark"" indeed; it felt like a thriller, even a horror film at moments, inducing a pervasive sense of dread. But it is so engaging and entertaining that you'll find yourself enrapt as 2 hours and 40 minutes whiz by and you're left wanting more. This film is why we--that is, 12 years old and up on this one folks--go to the movies.",1
"The best of the trilogy by far and that's no thanks to Bale's usual dialed up to 11 brand of overacting. Joker is the movie, Ledger is the Joker Leto wanted to be, a cool, edgy violent broken shark of a bad guy. It may just be me but stick Ledger and Caine's Alfred in the film without Bale as it would have been a top buddy movie. Worth a watch.",1
"In My Opinion, the movie teaches a great lesson about friendship and survival when two people in jail together are able to endure their hardship and become friends in the process. This is a great movie to help me discover what it means to be ""human"".",1
"--Spoilers Ahead!--The Dark Knight basically begins from where Batman Begins left us last time. Things have changed and a new maniacal nemesis is at large. Cleverly we are instantly thrown into a ensuing bank robbery with some sharp modern music. The first segments of Dark Knight already firmly establish this is going to be a piece of unrivaled greatness.When we get onto Batman and his antics we find that he has been imitated by others and his old friend Scarecrow is still up to no good, with shifty dealings. What follows are some brilliant action pieces blended with superb acting, with Actors of class under Nolan's direction being used to perfection.Christian Bale as the dual identity Bruce & Batman, really shows us he's settled into the role. Giving a deep growling Batman with beast like grating tones and a seemingly unlimited strength and fury. As Bruce Wayne, on the outside to Gotham he's still that rich, complacent playboy who's living the life of luxury and at the same time burdening responsibilities and dark secrets.Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes was for me one of the disappointments of Dark Knight. I'm sorry but she may be a fine actress but she just wasn't attractive enough, her acting isn't question, it was alright, hardly memorable. I reckon they should of stayed with Katie Holmes for this sequel, for then even the people that didn't like her in the role would be happy, considering the outcome at least. I on the one hand wasn't phased when push came to shove and said character was gone from play, in my mind she did start to slow down the film.Now Heath Ledger playing Joker, what can I say? Partly the huge success and interest has been due to this great Actor's performance being witnessed. After all this is Heath's last film he finished. Going on to his performance as Joker I have to say he is perfection, every time he's on screen he's mesmerizing, every little thing he does which ranges from the sick depraved to the downright mad. Heath Ledger was a chameleon, a method actor, who had the ability to change, to shape himself into any part he played. Dark Knight is one of the finest examples of this, truly blasting Jack Nicholson's version apart and I guarantee an Oscar for him, or for his memory and in honour of this talent. I loved how immersed Heath had become in the Joker even giving us details to how his face had gotten into it's current state and his abusive childhood and father. Whenever we have a villain there is always a reason to how he got to that point and Nolan uses Heath to get this across effortlessly. Joker never seized to make me laugh in appreciation despite what could be considered sick antics, I considered genius. Who else could do a pen trick with someone's head? Dress as a nurse with a silencer in hand and his clownish face glistening? Hide in a body-bag to infiltrate a mob boss's joint? Who else could immortalize Batman's most famous nemesis Joker? Without a doubt Heath Ledger bar none.Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two Face was a really interesting character. He played this politician extremely well, with all his good intentions and honourable ways, Harvey hides a dark side too. References to his coin are used regularly and help us understand the reasons for his later fascination with chance and luck deciding fate. I think Harvey Dent was covered nicely in this, getting across the whole growing hate he supposedly receives from Batman after he saves him and unfortunately Rachel isn't so lucky. Two-face, Harvey's alter-ego to my mind wasn't really that developed which is understandable given the amount of detail here to cram in and what with the Joker unleashed Nolan still does a top notch job. The effects on his face were breath-taking although I was starting to worry that Dark Knight maybe becoming unrealistic and veering towards more cartoony details in it's villains. But same with Batman Begins the Scarecrow was slightly more comic like and I found the whole realism in both Begins and Dark Knight to be a major achievement to me.Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon really excelled in his role this time. Not only does Gordon have more to do but he's in this awesome trio of Harvey, Bats and himself working together to save and help Gotham. I'm really pleased Gary Oldman & Heath Ledger got to do a scene together too, not to mention Bale too. The chemistry they all share and the talent rocketed through anything and everything. Nolan cleverly keeps the aspect of Gordon's family being important to him and later we remember this, and it helps us relate to his character when things unravel.Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine seem to have less to do this time round. With Caine taking most of the first half of the movie while Freeman takes the 2nd half to his chest.The Dark Knight was everything I expected it to be and it's certainly the dark masterpiece I predicted, but I do get the feeling that it's been overly hyped for what it consists of. See it not just for Heath's performance which is a defining and immortalized, but also see it because Dark Knight is the greatest comic book/graphic novel to movie ever. DC comics & Warner Bros. must be beaming right now with this piece of gold.Dark Knight really does have the last laugh. An astonishing achievement that really does follow up a masterpiece. Let's face it, a sequel is coming, without the need to get Two-Face to call it for us, we know it's coming Nolan.Perfection.",1
"This is a story that keeps on giving right to the end and it is delivered by Robbins and Freeman.Considering the movie takes place in a prison or perhaps because it does, it is an incredibly uplifting tale of hope, survival and a never give up attitude.The story as great as it is does come second to the performances of the 2 leads. They create a connection between each other and then the audience that entices you in and holds you close as a viewer.If Shawshank does one thing it makes you wish that more movies could be made like it.",1
"before i saw this movie i was never interested to see it as i am not a big fan of Batman Series but this was a sudden surprise for me to watch ! this movie belongs to The Joker, Heath is no longer in this world but this is Heath par excellence , from the start till the end all i wanted was joker to remain on screen and do what ever he was doing, i had a little problem with the length of the movie, i think it could have been cut a little short,as it is a little slow at places, performance wise its just about Late Heath Ledger,he has attained such a stature with this movie i wish he would have lived to see it and enjoy much more of it, may his soul rest in peace,he deserves an Academy Award for this one there is no question about it,i was not even a fan of Heath before this movie but after watching this i did think for once Gash ! he should have been alive but any how i give it 9/10 not for anything else but for Joker. don't miss this one a must watch",1
"SPOILER FREESo I went to a special screening of TDK last night, it was pretty ******* okay. The Dark Knight is the best interpretation since Burton's films (or some might argue since Batman:The Animated Series.It's a fantastic film which succeeds in impressing but if you step back & think for 2 seconds, it's not perfect, still has many flaws but is still the best blockbuster in years.I just have to get it out of my system, Batman Begins sucked on a huge level for me, poor & underused villains, some miscasting, a long & very boring first half, & not enough Batman. The Dark Knight succeeds in all these areas this time the parallel opposite to BB villains, the Joker is both terrifying & unbelievably insane, there are moments when he shows his insanity, the cinema find it funny I didn't...half the time anyway, I saw a deranged psychopath with no moral compass. Harvey Dent, I don't care what people say but for me the films belongs to Harvey, it stayed true to his comic counterpart, actually it didn't but character wise it does stay very true to the source material, Aaron Eckhart puts in an extremely memorable performance (as did Ledger) as Harvey/Two Face.Should I talk more about the good like the awesomely cool chase sequence or the occasional glimpse of a great musical score which ends up being a tad OTT but still great, nope I'm gonna talk about the negative stuff. The Dark Knight is not the truest version of Batman, the Joker wears makeup, Dent's transformation into Two-Face has completely been changed, stupid Rachael is still in it, & the convenient set ups are bloody annoying. All these things are Nolan's fault, why cause he wants his vision set in the real world, excuse me I'm never seen the Batman comics ever try to be realistic, in TDK you feel he's taking this too far & that in the next film it will get ridiculous, wouldn't be surprised if the Riddler was turned into some super hacker.Nice to see how conveniently he can get a new suit in such short time (only the later campy Batman films were guilty of this) or just so happens to have a Bat-Pod come out from nowhere, which still looks ridiculous. Rachael is now played by a different actress (Maggie) who I'm a fan of which made her character that more interesting than Cruise's wife from BB but still they could of used one of the many women in Bruce's life from the comics (& no not Vicki Vale). I have a slight problem with two aspects of Nolan's films which are related...Bruce Wayne, Bale is not playing Bruce he's playing Batman all the time, not literally & yeah I know Batman's mask is Bruce, there is no depth to Bruce's character, by depth I mean in the film it wants to be, but compared to any other blockbuster its PERFECT. You feel no emotional connection to the things which affect Bruce's life, you see it affect Batman but not Bruce, if you get what I'm saying. And the second thing related to this is Bale, he plays Batman not Bruce, when's he's Bruce he never shows the depth of acting a actor should for playing this deeply scarred torn character, look at Keaton in the original films, his face did half the acting while he was Bruce & he showed the exact version of Bruce I have in my head, a tortured soul who just doesn't fit in & not Bale pretending to be this ass of a playboy isn't quite the same thing. Doesn't help when the only scene I felt anything for Bruce was when he was sulking in the chair, which was both brief & required almost zero acting skills mostly cause the camera wasn't focusing on Bruce but more on Alfred. I only connected to Gordon & Harvey Dent, but both of the actors who play them are two of my favourite actors. Minus those two I just felt emotional connection to the characters, yeah the Joker does things which cause people to get angry & upset but the film distanced itself from showing any emotional depth other than a few scenes most of which are Harvey/Gordon related.This is much more I can criticize especially being a serious Batman fan but I won't go into that since it will give big spoilers away & this review is getting long . How about some positive closing comments (two paragraphs I mean) .The Dark Knight is by no means a bad film nor an OK film nor a good film...no it's a fantastic film which just about meets my expectations. I still can't get over Bale's voice as Batman (deep voice) or some of the aspects of the villains but it makes up for it with a very well thought out script, occasional snippets of unique & original dialogue (all by the Joker & Dent), some much improved action sequences over BB, & a fitting but not entirely satisfying fan-boy ending but is well done nonetheless.But here's the thing it draws more on the detective aspect of Batman but oh shock it really isn't, Batman does almost zero detective work honestly. And the big thing is it's become a film...not a superhero film, Nolan has sucked everything out of Batman making it this realistic story of an outcast, which is fine, hell even great...no fantastic but it's not an accurate version of BATMAN that's why I give it a 9/10 (so close to giving it a 9.9/10) I've thought about all night & I just can't be like everybody else & give it a perfect 10 just cause it was fantastic, I just don't think it quite earned a perfect 10.I still like Batman Returns & '89 more, I believe Burton captured Batman & Bruce Wayne better than Nolan ever will.",1
This has to be my favourite movie of all time. Also the first movie where I started to appreciate Tom Hardy and his acting skills. 10/10!,1
"I loved this movie. I had a lot of fun watching it the first time and I continue to watch it to this day. The Joker has an eerie sense to him and gives the feeling of chaos to the film. It has very realistic action sequences in it that make the film exciting and not boring at any times, which is key to a great film. It has amazing music and sound effects, and most of the stunts were performed in real life and look as so.Would recommend to anyone who likes crime dramas.",1
"this is one of the greatest movies of all time. in my opinion its the second best movie ever. everything is great about this movie the only thing i hate about this movie are the many clichés. like the maggot he found in his food the prison rapes, black-white guy friendship. every scene is perfectly shot. the acting is perfect. the story is brilliant. and every character is perfectly developed. i recommend every French and Germany dude to watch this movie in the Original language. it may be not you're favorite genre, but you can't deny that this is a great movie. i agree it is a bit overrated but thats not a reason to give this movie 1/10. if you rate this movie below 8 you're not human.",1
This is a great film. Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen.,1
"One of the best movies I have ever seen. It is right up there with Good Will Hunting and Casablanca. Morgan Freeman is at his best in this and his acting does not cease to disappoint. This movie is an absolute roller-coaster. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that you lose yourself in. You become so immersed in what is happening that it leaves an indelible mark on you. To call this movie less than a masterpiece is an understatement. The script and the cinematography is beautiful. This is a movie I watch with my family at least once a month because it's a new adventure every single time. It is Hollywood masterpiece that should not be touched. Simply stunning, majestic and a brilliant piece of art.",1

"What does this film, and why, in fact, I'm wondering in the first place this issue? Probably because the main idea of ??what to look for and morality that the film brings to your mind, if it is of course possible - this is the most interesting.

Not surprisingly, the book, however, as always, the better the movie. But Frank Darabont took unmatched movie that could play King wrote in his book, and in this film is definitely a plus.So what, exactly, teaches ""The Shawshank Redemption""?Andy Dyufreyn for as much as twenty years, has lost none of its force of will, ruthlessly, albeit slowly, breaking free, with it in secret.Frantic zeal for freedom. Why would it not be worth it. He lost twenty years of his life, because his wife, along with her lover killed by another person. And is it fair?The warden continuously urged Andy to believe in the Bible. Called, until one glorious day it has not broke big check, and the place of its documents and reports that Andy was doing, he found that same Bible, and a note from Dyufreyna himself. Hopelessness, a setup? Not at all, my friends. Andy just gutted out the truth, bringing his tormentor took his own life.And here it is, the same will, the life! Twenty years, he has only seen her in a dream!The very desirable house on the ocean near the Mexican land, a loyal friend, a little later freed Andy Dyufreyna, a small boat and hamburgers from a roadside cafe.

"I will warn you that my thoughts on this film are incomplete because I have only had a chance to see it once thus far. This movie demands multiple viewings and without that experience I don't feel equipped to write an accurate review, but I will do my best. Inception is a masterwork of creative cinema, and a tour de force of director Christopher Nolan's mastery of the craft of creating films that engage the audience on every level. If this film has a flaw, it's that it's too intelligent, too inventive, and too different for your average moviegoer to be able to fully appreciate. As a pure film experience, I don't feel that Inception is as finely tuned or well polished as The Dark Knight. However, the concept that is being presented and the sheer imagination that Nolan has created and shared with the audience is something truly special that defies explanation. This is almost without question the single most imaginative and inventive film of the 21st Century thus far, and among the top most creative of all time. Chris Nolan is truly the most gifted filmmaker of our time. I'm afraid this will simply be too new for the Academy to appreciate, but Nolan absolutely deserves every Oscar they can nominate him for. I knew this film would be a great movie, but I wasn't prepared for just how much this would exceed anything that has come before. I know, I'm going around in circles and saying the same thing, but this film cannot be explained and must be experienced. I would be doing you a disservice to try and put it into text. Simply put, go see this movie, as soon as you can, as many times as you can, and be prepared to change the way you think about what a film can be. Rating: A+",1

"My sister goes to the ""movies"" and wants to munch popcorn and be thrilled, scared or laugh to extremes. I go to the ""cinema"" and want to be impressed, provoked or mesmerized. She's down to earth. My head's in the clouds. She knows herself pretty well. I'm constantly ""redefining"". With her you get what you see. I'm a bit of a chameleon. She loved THE DARK KNIGHT. I couldn't wait for it to end.Many excellent ""movie"" things here. The protagonist/antagonist contrast was excellent. Ledger's Joker was truly fun to watch. The ""mood"" and pace of the movie were consistent; i.e., always moving evenly without lulls or digressions (hard to do over 2.5 hours). Action sequences were well placed and often thrilling. Acting was very good (and also consistent; i.e. no one over the top). All above thanks to an excellent script and great directing. Not to mention the fine score and camera work.Batman is a comic book hero written for adolescents. Kudos to the movies that used comic book dialogue, pace, music, etc. to bring comic book effect to the screen; e.g., the first Superman, the first Spiderman,the first Batman, etc. Its not a sin to exaggerate the comic book and create a hybrid monster replacing comic book dialogue, brevity, etc.,with Hollywood-enhanced scripting, music, technology, etc. Certainly it makes for great entertainment. But its not art.Farce is classical, sublime themes applied to ordinary, mundane subjects for strictly entertainment, usually melodramatic or comical, effect. A comic book hero is an ordinary subject. No matter how much you multiply the noise, sharpen the action, use clever dialogue, etc., its still farce. Its a credit to comic books that they started many of us to reading beyond empty HARDY BOYS fare (so did MAD magazine). Truly our comic books INTRODUCED us to themes, conflicts, ambiguity, etc., that we hadn't yet experienced. After all, we were twelve years old. I took my 12 year old son to TDK. Had a burger at Red Robin beforehand. I had a lot of fun the first 90 minutes of the film then became very tired (had a long day). My boy loved the movie and I'm so glad he did. Certainly he will move on to elevated levels, maybe become a writer. He will remember TDK like I remembered THE TIME MACHINE. I hope TDK is celebrated like KING KONG, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, ET, etc. Lets not confuse it with CITIZEN KANE, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, MIDNIGHT COWBOY, etc. I guess it all depends who you want to go to the movies with, me or my sister.",1
"A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate of Harry Potter. ""These are dark times, there's no denying,"" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. There are fewer and fewer allies around- even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks- and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order, including Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), attempt to escort Harry to safety- but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters, culminating in a exciting high-speed flying-bike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie",1

"OK, so first of all, this is a very good film considering it was back in 2008. Now there are some negative points to this film; first being that when this film was released, everyone thought it would be a very 'action like film' however when I watched it, I thought it was a bit of a comedy and not so much drama.But this shouldn't put you off because this is simply one of the best films of 2008. Now on to the positive side of things; personally, I watched this film a few years after it was released again just to give myself a recap of it and there were minor things that I thought should of been right but that is just me.This is a brilliant film for 2008 and if you have never seen any of the dark knight films, I recommend you watch it from this film all the way to the newest one!",1

From the start of this film I was confused on everything. I felt like I was watching a depressed person's life. Somehow I was curious about what was going to happen or what was really the conflict. By the end of this movie my whole total perspective of it completely changed within an instant. Things started from the beginning of the movie started to make sense. Everything in this film is interesting from beginning to end. I need let anyone who reads this review this one of the movie that you have watch couple of times to answer or to watch things you missed because ever little information is so helpful into understanding the plot and the story of it all. By the end of this movie I was doing research to gain a better understanding of the film. Movies that have to make the viewers think and try to put the puzzle back together. Are movies that deserve the most respect and frankly deserve an Oscar. At first I was initially critical about but by the end of the film I loved every thing about it.,1
"This film was a blatant piece of propaganda. If you can ignore that, it's quite entertaining. I found the propaganda in it an annoying intrusion on the escapism I was enjoying with it. In the original comic books there was little separating the good guys from the bad guys. Their roles were confused. In this film the bad guys were universally categorised as ""terrorists"". In addition, the film pointed out that it was justifiable to wiretap the entire population to catch these ""terrorists"", and that the orchestrators of these violations of civil rights are dark unwanted heroes who sacrifice themselves for the safety the populace. The person or persons wanting to send this message does not understand his or her's own confusion, and it is insulting to the intelligent viewer.Otherwise, a good bit of violent fun with lovely special effects. Shame about the propaganda.",1

"Inception is a movie that needs to be watched without being distracted or disturbed by others. Because it is that complicated the 1st time you watch it. The first time I watched it, it was so complicated, I had to watch it a second time. In the end, I bought the DVD and decided to watch it everyday, just so I could understand the concept and the movie itself. Finally I come to a conclusion that this is by far the smartest movie script and idea to ever come up in recent years.The movie concept is based on dreams. I can't actually tell you the plot, but the movie involves lots of twists and turns that you might not want to know, until you've watched the movie.I have to give extra credit to the special effects team, for creating a visual treat, and for the sound crew. Watching Inception in an IMAX theater, you will get blown away.I will give this movie a full mark, because of the brilliant acting skills of Leonardo DiCaprio, the well direction of Christopher Nolen, and because of this new concept.This is truly a masterpiece to be enjoyed.",1
"After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story, which again was very good. How anyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i am doubtful if this will ever happen.",1
I cant think of anyone else as batman anymore. This is how a superhero movie should be. Not following the same pattern as every other superhero movie Christian Bale is the best role as batman and Heath Ledger is a perfect definition of the joker. he was born for this role and it is so sad that i died. The dark night rises has not a so god but has one of the greatest endings i have ever seen,1
That movie you can see it ever and ever again to the rest of your life because you love every moment of him He deserve critically and commercial success every movie cannot reach that success for Thousand and Thousands we will be thankfully for the great writer in his best work he ever made and we will s till waiting for his next big thing every moment in this movie is important we would love to see that director again and again and he could be doing new with actors and writer once more that will be great and they will be blowing our mind this movie have one of the best movie ending and starting in the history of movies,1
"Overall: If you haven't watched this movie... YOU MUST! It is a fantastic movie and arguably (it is) the greatest superhero movie of all time. There is a reason that, as of today, IMDb ranks it as 4th best movie EVER made.Good: Stellar performances from EVERYONE especially Heath Ledger who absolutely steals the show with his riveting, groundbreaking portrayal of one of the greatest (fictional) villains ever. Incredible score mixed with incredible cinematography and incredible groundbreaking effects. Great story with mostly great dialogue and, obviously, great characters. A masterpiece.Bad: The cops are still morons and the Bat-Voice can get annoying.Best Part: The Joker's interrogation scene MVP: Heath Ledger as THEJoker 10/10",1
"No use for repeating the details, all has been said in the 800 and comments that have been submitted before mine. I just want to add to the euphoria. I read quite some positive reviews that made me decide to go watch it (not that I wouldn't have gone watch it without reading them). With expectations sky-high I had prepared myself for a major disappointment, as that happens quite often after reading too many movie reviews.No way today. The movie far exceeded those expectations, it's #3 in the Top 250 is absolutely justified. For myself as sci-fi action thriller lover it even deserves the number 1 spot, it is truly amazing and the best movie I have ever seen.Genius plot (Where does one get the idea of extractors stealing in-dream ideas from businessmen? Brilliant!), good actors all settling the roles of their lives, a story that develops at the exact right tempo with enough time for character development (I see that runtime is 148 mins, it feels like 60), truly AMAZING effects and an ending that will leave you flabbergasted in your seat.Go watch it, it's mean!10/10",1
"No comments, best movie. Good actors plays, plot so intersting, hmmmm",1
"It was about fifteen minutes in to this film thought I thought...man...this might be a 10/10 and it has been a LONNNG time since I scored a 10/10 on a film. By the middle of the film I couldn't even think about a score because my brain was being melted and twisted and I was sitting in the theatre with my mouth gaping open and drool probably coming from my chin. Inception is a mind bending, mind blowing, twisting, thrilling, brilliant, freakish, captivating ride of a film. You WILL NOT find a better movie this entire summer to date and is very unlikely you will find a better film the rest of the summer or year likely. You need to understand that for me (I know there will be many many arguments over this) this was instantly one of the best movies I have ever seen. Never mind the fact that apparently little to no CGI was used in the film was enough to impress given that the action scenes, the stunning cinematography, the brilliant special effects are some of the best in this history of film. The brutal, breath taking, and stunning zero gravity 'hallway' fight puts ANY fight scene to a back seat and to shame.Leonardo DiCaprio is obviously one of the biggest stars in the world. He is also one of the smartest stars because he is very choosy about his roles. Consider his success and level of artistic choices since the massive film success of Titanic. His level of intensity, screen chemistry, and simple stardom is in full swing in Inception. He carries the film like an absolute pro and he is perfect in his performance and absolutely deserves Academy attention. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is gradually proving what I have said about him for some time and that he is incredibly talented and has a truly awe inspiring performance in front of him. Inception will certainly help that! His character and performance is a little less outstanding as DiCaprio and is definitely a supporting character but he still has some incredible moments including the aforementioned 'hallway' battle scene. Ellen Page is terrific as the young architect on the team. She still gives off the Juno vibe and I hope she can work to break that but her and DiCaprio have great chemistry as partners and she is a welcome addition to the cast. Tom Hardy has some good scenes but certainly takes a back seat in the cast to the main characters. I think I would have liked to have learnt more about his character but he is secondary to the cast. Ken Watanabe gives a solid remarkable performance as the cut throat businessman holding DiCaprio's life in his hands. Despite also being supporting his performance is stronger than some of the others but regardless they are an ensemble team and cast. Cillian Murphy gives nothing short of the performance of his career as far as I'm concerned as the target of their 'inception' Robert Fischer. Murphy is supporting as well but really gives a solid, convincing and intense performance. For the main cast the final performance is also award worthy I think. Marion Cotillard plays DiCaprio's late wife Mal. She is part villain, part heroine, and part romantic interest and balances her multi-faceted character flawlessly. The characters that play small cameos but really an amazing job include Tom Berenger (really top notch), Pete Postlethwaite (ADORE this guy), and the amazing Michael Caine in a sadly small role the is literally a blink of the eye.After the success of The Dark Knight (even though I believed it to be a little bit over-hyped) no one doubts director Chris Nolan's talent but Inception is a whole different ball game. This film is brilliant, this film captivates a whole new world of Science Fiction, thriller and action. I wanted to watch it again as the first of the credits began. While the story is intensely complex and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen for a single second, it wasn't hard to follow. It doesn't get muddled and somehow (brilliantly) every step makes sense and as much as it hurts your brain you can follow every single move throughout the movie as they essentially go down FIVE levels of a person's subconscious dream level. If I heralded this film too much...you're wrong its not enough for a film that should easily take nominations for Best Picture, Score, cinematography, actor, supporting actor, screenplay...I'm sure there is more. You DO NOT want to miss the best film of the year and the newest addition to at least the list of top five movies I have ever seen. 10/10 (standing ovation here)",1
"The beginning of the film is remarkable, but when Andy finally gets out of solitary confinement and is sitting against the wall next to Red, you can feel the stress and the intensity of the movie. There is no other movie that I have ever seen where a silent intensity has ever been done so well. You as a member of the audience know that something is going on, and the storytelling by Morgan Freeman seals the deal. The acting in this film is remarkable, and the subplots and the heartfelt ending of the film truly make this film worthy of the number one spot on t list. The writers and casters of the film could not have selected a better actor for Andy's part than Tim Robbins, with his logical, calm, and reserved personality that reflected so well onto the film. Finally, the realization of the other inmates that Andy is in fact innocent is absolutely chilling, and has you rooting for the character all along. This film is number one on the top 250 for a reason.",1
"This film could have been so much stronger, but it sacrifices whatever power it had as a social commentary in the last half hour with a ""twist"" ending that seems completely out of place... there were weaknesses early on (the dialogue and narration is a bit precious, and the entire film has a slick, music-video quality that contradicts its criticism of consumer culture), but I could forgive its early faults and focus instead on its good points-- the jabs at yuppiedom, media images of masculinity, etc. It wasn't perfect, but I was enjoying it... and then it just tanked. The last act is idiotic in itself-- but it doesn't stop there, it reduces the rest of the film to a worn-out joke.  The climax literally took me out of the story. A missed opportunity.",1
"The best movie i had ever seen. the story , direction every thing is just amazing",1
The best movie ever made. Perfecto. Andy duffreine is the ma,1
"This movie will blow you away in many ways. The story is the typical ""Good Vs Bad"" that we have seen in countless movies before but the way the story is told is both unexpected and brilliant. It's a fairly long movie but the length never seems to be a problem because something is more or less happening all the time and the story progress all the time, so when the movie ends you don't feel like you have been sitting for almost two and a half hour, you just sit there with a huge ""WoW"" on your face.Heath Ledger as The Joker sets such a perfect example of excellent acting that I will not be surprised if hes performance will stand as a pure example of how a bad guy should be acted. He's calculated, deliberate, to the point. In other words, as far from a cliché that you can come. My hat off for hes performance, rest in peace Ledger, know that you have sett the perfect example of how things are meant to be done.The other actors are doing a very good job, from Bale to Oldman, everyone is doing their job splendid. And they have to do it, to be able to keep up with the acting Ledger is doing with the Joker. Bale has to be the perfect ""Good guy"" in order to take down the perfect ""bad guy"".All in all this is one of those movie you have to be insane to miss. If you're looking for a action movie that blow you away this is the one and only to see.",1
"This film certainly tells about how one's talent can be his tool to survive even in worst situation and if you use your talent, you may end up well.This is why liked this one.The movie is very well written and maintains the mystery and curiosity till the end.The title justifies the story and a kind of reveal message about the plot of the film. The film lacks a strong female character which would have spiced up things more. The film have some comic timings, limited only to few scenes.The portraying of the characters has been well lived in the story and thus make it a must watch movie of all the time.No doubt it is going to be in number one for a long time.",1
"A lot of people have this movie all wrong. Especially the ones giving it the negative reviews. This movie isn't about following in Tyler Durdens footsteps which a lot of of people on both sides think.Now I only allow myself to have one 10 star movie and one 10 star tv-show(band of brothers). This movie is my number 10. This movie starts out showing us how much of our society is brainwashed and dull. How nothing we do is fulfilling. It's takes you through the narrators life of buying useless junk that is supposed to make him feel better.Then he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden in the begging is the hero of the movie. He shows people how dull and asleep they are. He forces them to follow dreams that society has made them push far down. The narrator made him because as said in the movie ""it's not till you lose everything that you are free to do anything."" And the narrator had lost everything. He was a complete loser and made a strong personality for himself that took over. Tyler was the one that woke him and many others up to the toxic society they lived in.Unless you've seen the movie many Times the next part might not be as clear but Tyler then becomes the villain/antagonist. He used his influence to cause terror. The writers try to make you understand in the end that Tyler is no longer the one to look to. It's trying to show you that we as a society follow the strongest personality and don't do things for ourselves.The movie starts out showing us that we are dull society and uses Tyler to portray a way out. To get out of consumerism and wake up follow our dreams. It then turns the movie around after the narrator wakes up. The movie then try's to tell us that we as a society need to stop following the strongest personality. It again uses Tyler Durden to portray this but in a negative light as the narrator is now the protagonist.As for the reviewers giving negative reviews for the plot holes and calling themselves ""cultured"" I've seen 80% of the top 250 and almost all of the classics out of that. This is one of the best movies I've seen at covering all of it's holes. The narrator is an insomniac and therefore cannot sleep giving Tyler plenty of time to do his work. Just because the movie isn't 25 hours long and shows you how Tyler does everything doesn't mean that you cannot use your brain to put two and two together. You have to watch this move many times to even have an understanding of it and watching it once and deciding it's not to your level is childish and shows how little you know.",1
"One of the best movies ever made. Morgan Freeman is like always best playing a role, he is magnificent. In my opinion Tim Robbins makes one of his lifetime roles here as well. As the plot says ""Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" but this movie is actually more than that. I do not want to ruin pleasure of watching so enjoy it as much as you can. Also in my opinion this movie was the foundation for other good movies, one of that being Inception that has ""some"" of the Shawshank Redemption ideas inside . In my opinion this can be called the beginning of a new era in cinematography history as it records new (for the time) approaches on movies and acting (see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) . Also, this movie is one of the new plan to save Hollywood movie industry at the time as Hollywood was almost deep buried in clichés and bad producing and acting movies. Just to shorten it up i am speechless and please watch, enjoy and have a nice experience.Thank you for reading my review , hope i managed to catch you and please stay tuned.",1
"The dark knight is one of my favorite movies of all-time. I really didn't expect much before i saw the film but when i did, i was complete blown away. This is the way superhero movies should be made instead of making forgettable popcorn flicks. All actors that includes Christian bale, heath ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Cain, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan freeman, brought There ""A"" game in the superhero drama. This movie isn't overrated because it deserves all the credit its Been getting including heath ledger's performance as the joker. The movie had a great script, thanks to Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan. The acting, cinematography, action, and editing is outstanding and all the film crews did a phenomenal job. I'd like to thank the director, Christopher Nolan for influencing me as an aspiring filmmaker and putting a lot of heart into ""The Dark Knight"".10 out of 10",1
"The Shawshank Redemption movie is about importance of liberty in life. The movie is about how well you can hold your nerves and patiently waits and tries for freedom. It shows the value of a skilled person, how a person if he is perfect and smart in his skill can turn the things and earns differently more, than others. Not only skills but if you rejects pessimism and keep aspiration in darkest and toughest stages in your life and have ability to create and find happiness from the little things you have by making friends, helping others by using your mastery and constantly keeping your efforts to reach to your destination. You will sooner see dawn of success.The movie is really well made and I couldn't find any lack or part which bored me, from start to an end, it's an out and out interesting and engaging to watch. Leading actors' tremendous performances are really countable and strong reason in success of this movie. Highly recommended for everyone.",1
"This comments would be useful for the ones who will watch the re-release this late January. Actually, this is the best of all the best and the best, best, best movie all the way. To say, it is the BEST movie for the year, the BEST motion picture all the time, the BEST characters played, the BEST storyline, the BEST sequel movie, and the BEST superhero movie that I've ever watched.Actually, from the first time, the first second I watched the movie, I directly fell in love with this movie!!! Even though the duration of the movie is quite long, I'm even hoping for the longer duration, because I can watch it all night long for sure!!! The way the movie-maker fill each plot is outstanding! I can't even feel bored by even a pinch, I always had the curiosity of knowing what is the next plot, the next storyline of the movie.The is sure a bomb inside the movie that makes me feel great when I watch the movie! It is that somehow a little different turn-out after each plot. I was really exited and never find the weak-point of the movie. The character that is imaged by all the actor is really wonderful, the way they act is unforgettable, especially Heath Ledger, imaging the JOKER, it looks really real that the kind of that people is actually exist, I can't explain how but it is just outstanding!The other great thing is that the movie is spotless. All the act is somehow real that maybe there is a real batman and Gotham out there. And the other thing that makes me love the movie is like I am also having the role inside, because it is connectible to the audience. And every character seems to have a great connection and ahhh... can't tell everything by words! All of the thing inside are great!I really refuse if anyone said that this movie is BAD! I will never forget the movie, and I am really expecting for the next sequel that would be really fun, but I think it is quite miserable that Heath Ledger is no more...Just want to recommend all the one who read this to watch the movie next time!!!! Cheers!If I can, the rating is 20/10 lol",1

"One of the very best but a bit boring at times though in the end it doesn't really matter. The casts were good, the script was good, all in all a legendary masterpiece. This movie has turned some action loving freaks into drama/thriller psychos (thanks to me). My advice, if you haven't seen this movie, take some medicine so that you can stay awake during the entire period but once you have finished, you will be awake for the rest of your life.",1
"Do you know what makes this movie brilliant? The idea is brand new. Nolan has outdone himself. This movie is really complexed. It makes you think about dreams and what they really are. It makes you wonder if they are real. Because when you are in a dream it seems like reality. The story is powerful. You can see that everyone has put a lot of effort in the movie and that just makes the experience better. The characters are really deep and you can see them as real people. The actors made a connection with their characters and because of that they are even better shown. Cobb is the most complicated characters of all. He is fascinated with the dream world but he wants to be in the reality where his children are. His wife makes the whole story even more difficult. She went crazy from the dream land and he is scared he will go to. Leonardo DiCaprio did great in the role of Cobb and he fulfilled the character. Arthur is a simple character. He is Cobbs closest friend, although he does not know much about him. He is interested in Ariadne. He is very smart. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was the right man for the role. Ariadne is an future architect and the best at her collage in Paris. She is very curious. In the movie she is used to introduce the audience with the dream world. She reveals Cobbs secrets and she is his shoulder for crying. From this movie you can see that Ellen Page will become a great actress. I simply think this movie will intrigue you if you like the types of movies whit a lot of twists and turns. It is the best movie in years. So i will give it10/10*",1
This is as close to perfection as a movie can get!,1
"Every part of story linear each other, acting every cast incredibly amazing. Very thrilling and unique superhero (very grounded)",1
"This action thriller is the perfect mix of the best acting and directing Hollywood has to offer. Although Christian Bale's role as batman is outstanding, Heath Ledger's performance as the joker is what truly makes this movie one of the greats. Not to mention John William's score is encapsulating and keeps the viewer attentive. The plot is extremely detailed and diverse, yet easy to follow. Christopher Nolan's best film.",1
"I'm not sure I can endorse this movie enough.Literally, after seeing it, I walked out of the theater, hand over my face just muttering 'Oh my god.' Heath Ledger's performance was truly the pinnacle of a fantastic, and sadly short lived career. Every time after he exited the screen, both me and my mother turned to each other and went, 'Oh my god.' He's truly fantastic.The rest of the cast shines (I was extremely pleased by a Cameo from by one of my favorites from the previous film - yay Cillian!), the cinematography was just jaw-dropping. Hans Zimmer's score is just a ride.Truly a movie for the ages, but maybe not for all ages, think twice before bringing your 8-13 year old's - it scared the living daylights out of me (17 years old).RIP Heath.",1
"Boosted by a career defining performance by Heath Ledger, The Dark Knight is every bit as dark as it is entertaining. The writing is sublime, the acting incredible and the directing top notch.Mitchell Bulfin",1
"Every time this film comes on the TV I end up watching it all the way through. Even if it's on till 2am and I have got to be up early for work I stay up and watch it all the way through. I don't know what it is about it. Possibly Morgan Freeman voice hypnotising me. Or maybe I just enjoy it. Saying that though Green Mile does the same thing to me and Morgan Freemans not in that. I'd say I have seen this film more time than the name Andy Dufrey is said throughout the film. All in all a superb film and if you have not seen it yet, i'd like to know how you haven't with the countless amount of times it's been on the TV. Give it a watch and fall into the trap I am stuck in. (In a good way)",1
"In my idea the best movie ever made in history of Hollywood, I did not see all hollywood movies but I can guess that my idea is TRUE. You have to watch this movie at least 2 or 3 times to understand and see some scenes,tips and events.I watched ""Fight Club"" 4 times and every time I found and saw new things  and I'm sure if I watch it again I will find some other new thing. I suggest Fight Club to everyone",1
"You should watch this movie at least once, you won't regret it",1
This movie is the best from all the movies ever!!!!,1
"I have never watched such a wonderful and nicely plotted movie. It (The Shawshank Redemption) shows the hope, the dreams of life, hardships you face in life. While watching, we always move with it with the hope for best, all the time. Although there is quite a difference between the characters and the viewers, but we never feel far away that what the character is doing and what is the feeling of the characters. We always flow with the waves.This is a simple yet having a deep message inside down the film. the director didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. This movies should have win all the Oscars awards, I really love this movie. I have watched a number of times.I think everyone should watch this movie and keep the rating up all the time, so that i can remain in top 250. Also please let your friends recommendation about the movie. This is my all time favorite movie.",1
"""The Dark Knight"" is one of the best crime thriller movie I have ever seen. Though it is a Super Hero genre film but I would like to address it as a crime thriller movie because of its story and screen play. The movie is based on the DC comics character Batman which is produced, directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Undoubtedly it is Christopher Nolan's best creation. In this movie Christian Bale played the role of the DC comics super hero ""Batman"" and which is the leading character of this movie. Christian Bale just groomed in the role of Batman. He succeeded to give the feelings what actually Batman was feeling that time. It is mostly the challenging part for an artist to connect the audience with his emotions which he did very well. Another most important and iconic character of this movie is Batman's deadly enemy ""Joker"". The movie lovers know that most of the time our heart and mind blow with appearance of the Hero of the movie and most importantly when it is super hero movie. But I have noticed something different here! The villain of this movie who is the scariest and most dangerous enemy called ""Joker"" played the role by Heath Ledger blows the movie lovers mind with excellent appearance, expressions and dialogues. Heath Ledger's performance is praised by all as it is considering one of his best performances. I personally want to mention his smile in the movie along with his acting. Most importantly Heath Ledger won many awards for his performance in the movie. In this movie, Joker troubles Batman, a lot to expose his identity. Some cruel murder and explosion scenes plays with our mind to understand the psychology of Joker. A complex psycho killer turns the Gotham City in a hell. The screen play reveals everything by time passes and our mind enters to a conflict environment to identify the true black ship. Every creation has some faults and in this creation I found something. The duration time of the movie is very long. It doesn't need to stretch so long according to the story line of the movie. I think it harms the beauty of the movie. In some scenes it feels that the screen play is getting slow and the concentration breaks. But the story line and the act didn't allow to get bored. Actually it happens when the experience and energy of the great actors reflects with their acts. They can manage any lack with their beautiful skills that amuse us watching rest of the scenes. In addition, the violence, madness and cruelty of the villain may have a bad impact for the psychological upbringing but it is important to remember that the movie is for psychologically adults and not for the child. But overall it is a masterpiece and highly recommend to watch at least once.",1
"Fight Club is without a doubt one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen, speaking to the gen-x'ers in much the same way ""The Graduate"" spoke to the spawn of the 50's generation (albeit in a far more over-the-top scenario). From the entertaining visual trickery, to the awesome performances by Pitt and Norton, to the killer twist ending, this film speaks to the viewer on every conceivable level. It's powerful, funny, and action-packed.... and above all, unlike so many major studio films released nowadays, it forces the viewer to think. Which is perhaps the greatest service a film can perform.",1
This is the best Batman movie of all time. And in case you've lived under a rock for the last 10 years most of that credit goes to Heath Ledger and his iconic performance as the Clown Prince of Crime.,1
Truly a masterpiece of cinema. This is definitely one of my favorite movies.,1
"I clearly remember reading the novel by Stephen King before the movie was even conceived. Yes, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb in this movie, as well as any supporting actor. And yes, Frank Darabont made a stunning work to transfer the story onto the screen, but to me Stephen King remains the real reason why this film is still the number one here on IMDb. Story and characters are magnificently powerful already on the book and the film director managed to follow every page slavishly.",1
"as a die-hard king fan for 30 years, i have routinely been disappointed in the movies based on his books. this is quite possibly the best movie adaptation i've seen. overall, i was impressed with the performances of all the characters. maybe the only thing i wasn't clear about or didn't understand was the fact that some of the guards had accents that didn't seem to be louisianian. the accents seemed to be more boston-ish. however, it has been a while since i've read the books so maybe i'm forgetting a detail or two.ultimately, i recommend this movie to any stephen king fan, and to anyone in general! it's excellent!!",1
"One of the best directors in modern eraLove his style , music , Looking forward to his movies all the time",1
"I have anticipated this film for sometime now as a Ledger fan since I found him with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, a role he certainly deserved the Oscar for. Not the sad imitation of Truman Capote by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I still doubt the Academy's choices for awards and think the size of the studio has a lot to do with the number of votes, etc. So, although Heath earned, to me, another Oscar for THE DARK KNIGHT, the studio system will probably give it to the likes of Robert Downey Jor for playing a black man. Ledger's Joker was original, dark, twisted with that evil sense of humor that makes it a distinguished performance. I couldn't take my eyes off him. In every scene he held the reins in his hands. You could see the tension between he and Christian Bale, also a terrific actor, and the joy they had in working together. I should also like to thank director, Christopher Nolan, for his inspired casting. Unlike BATMAN BEGINS, which I thoroughly enjoyed and turned me on to the Batman series, this one had depth and incredible genius connected with it. Now you take these two powerhouse actors, Heath and Bale, and you spice them up with some of the most distinguished supporting actors you can dream up. With the likes of Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart, veteran Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, (terrific), Morgan Freeman, Anthony Michal Hall (far from those teeny boppers), Eric Roberts, Nestor Cabonell, from Brooke Shields TV sitcom, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, so much better than one level acting of Kate Holmes. When you look at Heath's work of the past, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, the gay man caught up in the guilt of his feelings, KNIGHT'S TALE, beautifully played as a simple man with dreams of glory, MONSTERS BALL, as the young rookie idealistic cop, TWO HANDS, a young man who attempts to find a better life yet falls into bad hands, CANDY, a disturbing look at the world of drugs and a guy who is fighting to survive, NED KELLY, a young rebel who is only fighting for his existence and defending his home against a corrupt militia, THE ORDER, a modern day priest who must find truth in a dark world of terror in the clergy, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, a gem of a sweet movie about love and giving Heath a chance to sing and dance which he loves. When you look at all this work in the short number of years he has been on earth, you think how much more we have missed by his early death. I can only imagine what heights he could have gone to. For he certainly was on his way. Life sometimes is cruel and unthinkable at times. I only hope they will honor this young actor this year with the Oscar he certainly deserves and for those roles we all will never see him play. Heath Ledger, you are a star in Heaven now.",1
"An unmatched movie. I really missed this kind of movie. The story was excellent. Nowadays, it is very difficult to find such a work. Really surprising story of an ordinary man. When the life changed, people may find themselves different way of struggle. Coping with life change, how a man can find his aim in a different way. Human can fixed his freedom nothing stop him. A very successful scenario. I can say that the actors are indeed perfect.It's impossible to think of the end as you get trapped in the flow of Filmin. The result is really emphatic.",1
"This film is sheer brilliance.  It's got everything a great film should have: stunning cinematography, great characters, powerful directing, a plot that twists and turns and leaves you guessing, plus more than I could ever put in this review.This film is for men and about men.  It portrays the deep angst men feel, as well as how to be a 'real' man.  Tyler Durden sums it all up while sitting in the bathtub drinking a beer when he says, ""My old man never went to college, so it was real important that I go.  So I went to college and got my degree.  After graduation I called my old man and said, 'Dad, what should I do now?'  He said, 'get a job.'  So I went out and got a job.  Then I made my annual call, and asked, 'Dad, what should I do now?'  He said, 'I don't know, get married?'  We are a generation of men raised by women.  Somehow I wonder if another woman is really the answer we need?""A stunning observation that hits almost any man in the head with full force. We are a generation of feminized men who were raised by women.  The generations that came before us were raised by our fathers, and this has somehow become lost in our society.  Fight Club provides the male legacy that existed on this planet for thousands and thousands of years before our current generation.  As Durden observes, the answers we seek as men will never come from women, but from other men.If you are a man under the age of 40 and have not seen this film, it is your moral imperative to rent it and watch it immediately.  And after you've seen it, get together with the guys and throw a few punches of your own!",1
"One of the best movies I've ever seen, if not really the best. That ""Angel's Prison"" name in Romanian, I agree with it. It has marked my summer vacation last year, I thought about it very much, and how an innocent man can be punished for what he didn't do. I also liked his perseverance, and how he never gave up his ambition to become a free man, legally or not. The sad part was Brook's death, but I understood his decision and agreed with it. I also very much liked the way that Andy and Red bonded over the time Andy spent in prison, and the things he had done for the men in prison, like the library, and the courses he taught, and how he refused to give up his position, that moment when he played the music. A true ""Must See"" movie.",1
"All time hit.
Acting Level Infinity.The only other movie i have ever seen that affects me as strongly is to kill a mockingbird.",1
"The minute I saw Leo Dicaprio and Nolan collaborating to do this project, I knew I was going to experience a brilliant one. Dicaprio has an uncanny knack of selecting mind blowing projects, previously with Marty Scorsese, now with Nolan.This was a gem of a movie. It was a very exciting and captivating script and was flawless in it's direction. The fact that it was written, directed and produced by Nolan tells us what a genius he is. He explores the concept of dream invasion. The cast here have done a brilliant, it explores a very futuristic idea and has all the elements a good movie needs(a little bit of comedy too, thank you bob!). It has the one quality about it that is present in most greats, you cannot take your eyes of it once you start watching. It is without a doubt the best movie of the year so far and is a must watch.Oscar bells are ringing.",1
"Work can't represent you, bank deposit can't represent you, the car you drive can't represent you, the things in the wallet can't represent you, the clothes can't represent you, you are just one of ordinary beings.",1
"I've just had an idea, why don't I write a review of this movie?I sadly missed this movie in the cinema because I was young an did't care about adult movies, now that I watched it...WOW!
This movie...Nolan, deserves an oscar as best director! The action is fantastic, the messages this movie tells you are strong and well done and the acting is perfect.This movie is 10000 times better then Avengers endgame and I tell you, I loved endgame, but this movie is just perfect in every aspect.
10/10 one of the best movies I have ever watched.",1
"The suspense and surprise make this movie a Hollywood legend. It is awesome, the last 30 minutes are unbelievable. You can't catch what's coming. The acting performance by Morgan Freeman and his costars are incredible. This is a masterpiece.",1
It has been 10 years after and i always recommend the movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet,1
"Ah, sadly it looks like I'm going to give a negative review of what seems to be a netbrow movie.First, I want to point out I gave it an 8 out of 10. Because I didn't like it doesn't mean I'm going to give it a 1. Puleez... anyone giving a film a 1 better be prepared to defend their review compared to ""Manos, the Hands of Fate."" On to the review.Next, my wife started to fall asleep near the end of the film. She DOES tend to drift off, so this by itself isn't too bad. However, she didn't fall asleep during such nailbiters as ""The Fugitive."" This is going to sound like an odd complaint, but the music damaged a lot of the experience for me. Scenes needing a delicate touch (such as the climax) were given the ""Flight of the Valkyrie"" treatment (and for those reading this with the lack of musical background, that music was blared for the beach battle scene in ""Apocalypse Now."") Emotional presence in the first of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was gained in the fight with the cave troll by the total absence of music. Music in movies is about balance. I could say more, but let's stop here as it's simply said that music is ""Inception's"" biggest failing.Next, the whole cast does a superb performance. Wow. Good acting. DiCaprio's emotional portrayal's are very believable. I enjoy watching Ellen Page (""Juno"" is a delight) and the other supporting cast who never seem trivial. Sadly, a lot of Ken Watanabe's lines were delivered with such a heavy accent I struggled to follow what he was saying. There is no particular reason he should be hard to understand.But now let me discuss my biggest problem with ""Inception."" There is a deep point made about emotion and intellect in the film. There's not much to say about the intellect portion. So I move to the emotional parts. Read on.I cry in movies. I admit it. ""Old Yeller"" is a given. However, I got weepy in ""Toy Story 3."" A good cry over characters you have come to love in 90 minutes isn't bad. For all DiCaprio's good acting, I just couldn't give a flying spit-wad at the crux of his emotions. For all the good dialog, special effects, complex and innovative plot, good acting, great writing... go on and on until the Oscar nominations.... the movie's point didn't reach me.My prediction: ""Inception"" stays in the IMDb top 250 for the first month as the film/tech geeks support it. In time, it drifts off to join ....hmm... at this point in this review I was going to name films, but I changed my mind. Let's just say there are many good movies that only get watched once. ""Inception"" is such a film. But there are many films I'll watch over and over: ""Amadeus"", ""Airplane"", ""Princess Bride"", ""Galaxy Quest"". Pick your film for re-watch. Then tell me next year if ""Inception"" is among them.",1
"First things first, i must establish that this film isn't an over the top sci fi flick which many people I've spoken to have thought from a first glance. This film is utterly beautiful. The originality in the concept of this movie is simply brilliant, the premise of diving into people's minds by going through their subconscious whilst in a dream state, and then extracting/mplanting thoughts and ideas is really interesting subject matter. Kudos to Christopher Nolan for attempting to pitch that idea when seeking to get the film made. Thank god the Pitch was successful though, because the final product is a real achievement. The film manages to skim through with a stylistic lure of contemporary magic, the visual beauty really entranced me as I laid my eyes on a feast of aesthetic splendour. From the moment the movies begins you know what your in for, with each slow motion shot of water and splinter spraying across the screen, you really feel a spell of hypnosis is being cast upon you. Film architecture, symbolic, narrative, conceptual and visual. The cinematography is really up to the task as well, from the vast backdrop of rolling snow and ice, to the tall and lovely architecture of the dream like city. But don't let the visual treats in this film pull the wool over your eyes, it is far more than a stimulant for the eyes. The story itself has a real emotional strength to it, the characters help this, especially the great performance leonardo di caprio delivers. The relationship struggles between himself and his confined love interest has a genuine feel to it, and the outcome of it mattered to me. There are doubts over the emotional connection he supposedly fails to strike with his estranged wife, but in my opinion the relationship they have is troubled, disrupted by confusion, yet clearly not lacking in any empathy. He had real problems in letting her go, and consistently sees her whilst trying to keep a lid on his feelings and actions. The struggle he goes through during the movie provides an interesting sub plot to the genius of the main story.Great action, snappy dialogue,intriguing ideas and imagery supply the makings of a feature that feels like your are actually inside somebody's mind and anything can happen. The style of the camera-work is something which compliments the structure of the film, perfectly utilising the angles, paces and focus needed to create the illusion it is trying to create. I went to see this movie with some friends at the cinema, and it really brought the best out of it's qualities. The surround sound, the big picture, the wonderfully composed score providing a suitable soundtrack, and of course a tub of popcorn to feast on whilst enjoying the extravaganza. As the film went on I became more and more absorbed into it, the pace building and building as each scene majestically sailed by with style. Come the end, I felt completely drained of all energies, but in the best way possible, as if I had run a marathon and I felt great whilst approaching the finishing line, desperate to complete the journey I had been on for the past couple of hours. What an ending it was too, perfectly executed, leaving it open to interpretation and opinion, a talking point to discuss an already fantastic feature. In conclusion, when watching this film, I really suggest doing so in a way which would bring out the best of it, for example purchasing a blu_-ray copy, and pump the volume up to appreciate the sights and sounds it has to offer.",1
"If you only got to watch one movie from the 90s, I'd have to tie between this fantastic title and Pulp Fiction. This unique take on consumerism and film-making/story-telling as a whole leaves you thinking for days after.",1
This was definitely a childhood classic for me. The franchise has been doing a pretty decent job with the batman series.,1
It's a great movie. I'm glad I could see such a movie!,1
"Movie freaks, Fans for Batman, Cristopher Nolan, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Joker (the character), this movie is for you all. The movie was always in the news. Initially for Heath Ledgers death and from then on it was the most awaited movie.Movie starts with Joker's antiques. Thats where the movie captures you. It has no rules. Heath Ledger as a joker is not only appropriate for the role but he has done the role in a rather unorthodox fashion. Perfect would be an understatement for him. He crawls into the skin of the character with charm and pulls it off with such a ease that you actually feel that that is Heath. Just when you think the battle between good and bad is over the movie comes with surprises from Joker. Its only too sad that he didn't live enough to see his best performance till date Harvey Dent played by Aaron Exkhart takes on the role of DA and later on Two Face with precision. He is the sane guy in the insane world. The real white knight. Rachel Dawes is good as both Harvey's and Batmans love interest.Finally Batman. Hats off to Christian Bale. I became a die-hard fan of this guy after Prestige, another beautiful film by Chrisotpher Nolan. Christian Bale dons the role of Dark Knight with finesse that a few before him have been able to do. I am surprised everyone here has said so many words about Joker and no one wants to say anything about Christian Bale. He has modulated voice for Batman and uses a separate voice for Bruce Wayne. The synchronization between him and Michael Caine is wonderful to watch. I also read that he gained lot of weight for his previous Batman movie.For that reason the entire cast. Unlike earlier Batman movies where the negative characters overshadow the entire movie, here all the characters have done more than justice.Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman have performed par excellence. And this movie has some messages which go beyond the batman movie. To say that one character steals the entire movie would be like doing an injustice.I will eagerly wait for next Batman movie hopefully by Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale.",1
"It sure would be a shame to go though life without seeing The Shawshank Redemption. It is a classic that draws emotions from start to finish. It is a long film, but you still won't want it to end. I will be watching again soon!",1
"First of all this movie is...well it's fu*king EXCELLENT! This movie is so good and the twist at the end and the plot twist is excellent. There is strong sex in this movie but this movie is not for the faint-hearted because of the very strong blood violence because it is so graphically bloody. I loved this movie, it was recommended by a friend and I have to say, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton SHOULD make more movies like this. Brad Pitt plays a bad boy soap salesman and Edward Norton plays a bored office worker with insomnia. The plot twist was good but the twist at the end was absolutely shocking. I loved this movie.I give this movie a good 10/10",1
"There is nothing more to say about this film: MUST BE WATCHED. As it will guide you into feeling that no other shot will. You will find a perfect line combination between two big faces: Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Where large chats will make you think and rethink about everything you though in your life. What's the real point of living? Are my problems serious enough to be worried about? We all should try harder finding the important little things on life that will make us happy, true happy.Moreover, we can find almost-perfect technique on screening every single shot from Frank Darabont. Releasing the true original idea from writer Stephen King.Sit, and enjoy.",1
"You have to give up everything first. You have to have no fear and face the fact that you will die one day. You can't be free until you abandon everything. People are evil. Vulgar, disgusting, sex, violence, anger, assassination, arson, taboo, love. The last thing a person should suppress is an unfair, boring, dull mechanical life. Fighting is the most primitive and effective way to relieve stress.",1
"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen, I love the way Christian Bale plays Batman and the scenes where the joker appears are the most entertaining of the movie.I recommend this movie a lot, because Christopher Nolan did a great job.",1
"I loved ""Batman Begins"" so i was excited to watch ""The Dark Knight"". Evn his rating was awesome so it gave me another reason to watch it. Also, the actor who plays The Joker died at the age of twenty eight.My impressions of this film won't be like many others peoples : i didn't enjoy that much and i'm not going rate this 10/10 or 9/10 but 7/10. I will explain why : I think the movie doesn't have rhythm because it chain one action scene and one scene with only dialogs all the time. Also, there are many scenes where you think it's over but in reality it's not (when Batman get the joker at the top of the building for example). So i felt as two hours and half were a bit long.Except all i told above, i liked the other things of the film. The Joker was nice and Heath Ledger played him very well.",1
"It is a simple film, good feeling, mind blowing and satisfied.
Must watch",1
This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.,1
"A great movie with a great idea, unique plot and with a twisty ending. The best part about this movie is the MUSIC/soundtrack, unbelievable music from Hans Zimmer. The ensemble cast is one of the best Acting I ever seen and it just excellent overall. But perhaps the greatest is the use of PRACTICAL effects. And yes, most of the movie is made with practical aspects, not CGI like most people think.. See the Hallway Dream Fight - Art of the Scene by CineFix, crazy impressive yet no one knows about it. Again, I can't stress enough how great of a movie it is and just how impressive everything is, from art direction, cinematography, acting, soundtrack, special effects. and a stunning plot and ending. I have watched this movie about 10 times and I am still not bored of it. My most favorite movie by far!",1
"This movie left my mind swirling in awe.The first time I saw this movie I though it was a guy flick. Boy was I wrong. It has to be the best psychological drama ever made.This movie will leave your emotions all over the road map. It is funny, scary, sad and comforting all at the same time.Easily a cult classic. You will find yourself wanting to watch it over and over again.This role was made for Edward Norton. His performance was brilliant as were the performances of his supporting cast.If you haven't seen this movie, you must watch it. Be cautioned though... You will be shocked! Not everyone can handle it's raw content. But give yourself time to absorb it, watch it a second or third time and you will be dumb founded.",1

"An expert in seeding thoughts in the minds of even the wariest victim assembles a team to take on the heir to a megalomaniac corporation. But the expert's mind has thoughts of its own ...Spectacular effects to deliver an elaborate plot engine, with good performances all round. The editing and music keep us thrusting along, and the complexity of events is managed just right. On second viewing, I got the sense of illusionist nerdiness, but it's still invigorating to watch.Many criticise Nolan for coldness, or losing his characters in a display of fireworks, but I did feel the substance at the heart of this story: a man in search of his lost wife, which is nailed in the core scene on the hotel window ledge. However, there's a big problem: what about the kids? Oops! Wouldn't it have been better if their real life was dogged by the unfulfilled desire for a family, but then at the bottom of Inception ...?Overall: Impressive, but flawed.",1
"Before going to Inception, I know this much about Nolan, I loved Batman Begins and Dark Knight and I didn't like Memento but I don't remember why - it may have been my state of mind, so I will rent it again to see what happened. I also knew I was excited about seeing Inception thanks to fantastic trailers and reviews.Arriving at the local, usually ""ok"" Carmike theater, I was upset they put Inception on the smaller, non-digital screen. I hate you now, Carmike.Leaving Inception, I was mostly fretting over the ending, not knowing what it was that happened. I will have to get back to figuring that out later. As for the rest of the movie, I can safely say I have never seen a solid, mature movie like this. As one wonders if we leave our brains at the door or bring it ready for action, don't concern yourself. There is absolutely something for all. Where thought seemingly is abandoned and action takes over, we all know what happens when bullets fly...or do we? Because of the varying levels of involvement, you have to analyze the action and the possible consequences of it. Believe me, consequences are always in the middle of the moment.Visually, I do not see how anyone can be disappointed. I do believe the true adrenaline junkie will be disappointed, however. Despite the amount of action, Inception, to be so truly admired, requires much thought, and that's a much appreciated positive concept these days.Personally, I am so thankful there are people like Nolan out there. He convinced me that he cares about his creations. Inception is probably one of the most completely respectable movies as far as I am concerned. Nothing lacked except for one thing - the explanation for the ending. I need more time to finish my thoughts on that. Everything else was great. Acting, action, visuals, the cute musical allusion to one of the best performers in Inception, the mystery, and the perplexing concept of the story itself all come together as the key to true cinematic success.You might think I would give it a 10 but because of the stymieing end, I am going to be stubborn enough to give it a 9. Loved Inception and thanks again Mr Nolan!",1
"There is no better film than this, it's just incredible. Morgan Freeman is absolutely brilliant.",1
The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling. The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it. Breathtaking!,1
One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous!,1
"Two years after its release I've watched this movie. My expectations were high and I couldn't help thinking back to the big impact The Matrix had on me 13 years ago. It blew my mind. I'm not going to try to compare the movies in detail but there is one big similarity: the 'world in a world' concept. Inception takes this idea a lot deeper than the matrix and this is the main draw of the movie as it keeps you intrigued throughout it. But brace for impact: for I must rant a little.The problem with the whole dreamworld thing is that sometimes everything goes so fast that it often gave me the feeling I was missing half of what everything was about. I appreciate the movie trying to be smart but it should have contemplated it's own smartness a bit more, as to give the viewer solid ground for the next scene. Now it felt like my topics of confusion were just piling up throughout the movie and this left a unsatisfying feeling in my mind when the credits rolled.For example: more than halfway the movie there is a chaotic chasing scene with a lot of snow speeders and I was thinking 'who the f*ck is chasing who?'. All the while montage is shown from what happens to the main characters in other dreamworlds. But where was the focus? About whom should I care?? The overload of scenes made me feel disconnected from the story. I had this feeling of chaos way too often. Also 'jumping from worlds' felt too casual and the dreamworlds seemed too unrealistically realistic to me, despite a few awesome scenes where the dreamworld gets warped.Everybody who dreams knows how weirdly fragmented and incredible dreams can be but in Inception the dreamworlds look just like 'the real world'. This helps strenghtens the feeling of confusion about 'which world is more real' but to me it feels more like a conservative choice in artstyle whereas the director could have done so much more with the weirdness of dreamworlds! Other issues i had with the movie is the characters seemed pretty flat to me. This is due to the confusing nature of the movie which for me made it difficult to bind with the characters. Or maybe it's that I don't dig DiCaprio that much. He has to carry the movie but he is just too smooth for my taste. Only in the end i genuinely felt moved by the climax of his emotional complex but it took me the whole movie to really felt moved by it. For me, as a Science Fiction fan, I love it that this movie creates some intriguing adventuring in dreamworlds but i just wished the movie would've cared to explain itself better, also that the dreamworlds would have been more bizarre and that the 'real world' in the movie would have been more futuristic. I mean, the movie plays in the future but besides the dreaminfilltrationequipment being used I never saw any sign of it portraying the future. Offcourse you can say 'it's in the near future' but for me that would be a lazy excuse. I don't expect the movie to be like the matrix but a little effort would have been welcome.Excuse me for nagging so much but I just feel mixed about this movie and would like to make a point in contrast to the heaps of praise this movie gets. It might be that a second viewing will shift my mixed feelings to the positive side because this roller-coaster, in all it's confusion, is perfect for a second ride. I just wished it already would have been awesome the first time.",1
"Inception is a really fun movie, and I very much enjoyed it when I saw it in 2010, before it became a ""must see"" movie. The plot is convoluted, but fun, and the visuals are amazing. The issue I have is that it has become something of a classic when it really does not deserve this status: there are serious issues with the plot, once one considers it closely, to the point where the climax is totally unnecessary if the characters had simply been a bit smarter about things. This lack of re-watchability is disappointing.Still, on a first viewing, the movie is a really fun, visually impressive ride.",1
"When I first consciously watched this movie, I was 12 years old... Nowadays when I look back at time and try to remember what it meant to me... I recall that I was mesmerized and emotionally satisfied.This is one of those few movies that offers something for anyone. It's not about love. It's not about war. It's not about hatred. It's about injustice. It's about hope. It's about getting revenge from life by using intelligence rather than raw violence. I watch this movie perhaps once in every year and I must say, if you haven't already, you better go watch it and if that movie doesn't mean anything to you my friend... I can't be your friend anymore because you're either a sociopath or a fascist.Btw, I'm 30.",1
"A soul refreshing film, but the genre itself is. That doesn't put it above other genres, so I feel that the balance needs to be re-established in the ratings.9/10",1
"A pity. A fine idea. Just not quite pulled off with enough cinematic craft and expertise. The script probably needed another draft to transform the talkative explanations into a more cinematic form.A Mission Impossible IMF mixed with a Matrix-like world is a stunning idea. Unfortunately, Inception doesn't quite know whether it wants to be a human drama, a tragedy, a high-concept sci-fi flick or just a plain old thriller. It end up falling short of all of them.And DiCaprio is miscast. Personally, I think he is an empty-shirt of an actor. All surface and no projection of any depth or enough intelligence for this role.Inception runs over 2 hours, but feels heavily edited at the beginning and the end. Despite this, it takes its time wordily explaining the concept of 'inception', fails to develop any of the characters for the audience, relies on the bombastic Hans Zimmer soundtrack too much and utterly fails to build dramatic tension in the slow, too-drawn-out conclusion.A great opportunity missed.",1
"In Inception, we are taken on a deep and highly illustrated exploration into the field of technologically assisted lucid dreaming, dream communication, and the subconscious mind. After seeing this movie for the first time in the theaters, I have seen it two more times, and with every subsequent viewing, I have been able to understand the concepts even more. Throughout the movie there is talk of a technique named ""inception"" which can be used to implant messages into certain people's subconscious mind during a certain stage of sleep, hence the tittle of the movie. A fascinating aspect of this movie is the premise of a person being able to communicate with another person while both of them are in a dreaming state of consciousness. On top of that this film explores the different varying levels of dream states and how factors in the physical environment outside of the dreamer translate into factors in the dreamer's lucid dream or subconscious. After doing personal research on the topic of lucid dreaming & the inception of lucid dreams, I have found out that there ACTUALLY ARE a variety of technological instruments which have been developed which are capable of achieving some of the results(or results similar to those) which were achieved in the movie. Thus, Inception is not a total work of fiction or science fiction, but also a reference to what can be and/or is possible to an extent with technology that is currently available or which may be available sometime in the near future. As a person particularly interested in the fields of Parapsychology, Dreamwork, & Psychology, Inception is no doubt a classic production in my eyes.",1
"Let's get this out of the way right now: This movie does NOT make you think. I am so sick of that cliché. A movie may be challenging to the senses and demand your undivided attention, but it can't make you think. You think independently of movies, people. Stop giving Hollywood that much credit.That said, I found Inception to be a grand disappointment. One of the things that marks other Chris Nolan projects is his love of character and development of such. Nolan has interesting ideas, but once he gets the germ of an idea, he then populates his films with rich and interesting people, giving them compelling stories, making us care about what happens to them beyond the constructs of the idea. Not just masterpieces like Memento, The Prestige, and Insomnia (one of the few English language remakes of a foreign film to get it right), but even in his ""comic book"" movies, Batman Begins and THe Dark Knight, Nolan's love of character and relationships is what drew us into the story.Insomnia is about 2-dimensional characters (okay, some of them flirt with being 2.5-dimensional) who wander through a complex and admittedly brilliant idea for a little over two hours. There are some stunning visuals and some quirky twists, but for the most part I fought to stay awake because I did not care. I was told not to leave to go to the bathroom or I would be lost when I came back; well, I nodded off for 15 minutes and did not miss a beat.And for all this primal hooting about the breathtaking final shot, a moment that elicited gasps from audiences across America ... not to sound arrogant, but I must be smarter than most audiences because I saw that moment coming. I knew how the film would end, and I knew what that last image would be.An okay film, but not up to Nolan's standards.",1
"After years of being told to watch this film I finally did a few weeks ago and was not disappointed. Stunningly written and amazing performances, Morgan Freeman is especially brilliant, even more so than usual. The clever nature of the script coupled with the uplifting nature of the story make it comfortably the best film I have ever had the pleasure of watching. When in response to the question 'what is the greatest film of all time?' I answer 'The Shawshank Redemption,' my friends tend to groan. They say that as it is such a common answer to the question I am copping out, I say there is a reason it is such a common answer. Truly life affirming.",1
"One of Christopher nolan's greatest movies yet. I mean seriously, a group of people that go inside a C.E.O's mind to plant an idea in his head and make him think it's his own idea. Where have you heard of a genius script like that? The actors are fantastic and the whole idea of mind and time going around is just great!. You ask yourself along with the characters what is real and what is a dream. Gonna need a totem after this kind of epic scenario.",1
"The movie is very awesome The character's are perfect for each position in this movie, the movie and story creation also very nice. each and every details of graphics are perfectly created and stimulated with story. I just want to say Leonardo DiCaprio is always good in his role, he act in this movie like real world we are watching in this movie. movie title also suite to the movie storyline,in my view movie is over rated and i saw something different then other smart movies. This movie Tell's the story of a team of experts who break into people's minds to steal their secrets by dreaming them.Inception stars as Cobb the leader of the team who has spent several years studying how to infiltrate dreams and steal information from them. Everything that people want to watch in every movie they got in ""Inception"" this movie is Smart,thrilling,innovative,creative,action,and best in drama, so watch and enjoy ,special thanks to Warner Brother Pictures.",1
"I've never written a review for any movie before and never really intended too, but once I saw Inception I just had to express my feelings on this movie.When I first saw the trailer for Inception I thought it looked good, but not great. When the reviews came out and they were using words like Genius and Masterpiece I thought a bit of an exaggeration. So clearly when I went into Inception I wasn't already in love with the movie before even seeing it, to be honest I had my doubts. Obviously by the title of my review I was clearly amazed by how good this movie was. I cannot say this is the best movie of all time because I just believe it is not possible to single out one movie out of all the movies that are out there, but I can say that this is easily one of the greatest movies ever made.I was very worried that the movie would be a little to complicated to follow but that was not the case. Mr Nolan laid everything out quite well for you to be able to follow the story.The movie has a running time of 2:30 hours and I never thought about anything during that time besides what was on screen. It was intense, fun, exciting, funny, smart and anything else you can think off all wrapped into one movie. If you want to see a movie like you've never seen before go see this movie. I have nothing bad to say about t and will be going to see it again for a second time very soon.",1
"Wonderfully made, wonderfully casted and excellent execution.
Ledger is God of the show. His portrayal of the iconic character is also iconic. He is joker himself while he acts. The other members of the crew are also wonderful. The whole movie runs on a dark and serious note and that is understood in a superhero movie and especially when it's about batman.
A must watch for all fans.",1
"I just got done watching Fight Club, and I have to say it is one of the most content-packed films ever made. By saying that I mean you have an exploitative, fun, mindless action movie shell that everyone enjoys, but at the same time there are so many underlying themes that literally EVERYONE can come up with a completely different interpretation. But like I said at the same time the movie is so much fun, poking fun at itself with lines like ""We can't all be movie stars"" spoken by Brad Pitt, a movie star, and of course, the dude's junk spliced in at the end is just beautifully hilarious. Overall, fantastic movie that I recommend to anyone and everyone that can stomach some rather harsh violence",1
"I would watch it 24/7 everyday all day forever, Ledger's performance is monumental, but The Dark Knight lives up to it. Nolan cements his position as Hollywood's premier purveyor of blockbuster smarts _ and the Batbike is kinda cool, too.You may have to fight yourself out. But a movie this potent and provocative is well worth the battle,This sequel to 'Batman Begins' is mesmerizing and thought-provoking. But it shouldn't have been named after the good guy. This is the Joker's court, and he's not looking for a laugh.The Dark Knight is bound to haunt you long after you've told yourself, Aah, it's only a comic-book movie.",1
"If you haven't seen the dark knight yet THEN WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE.
when batman begins came out 3 years prior to the dark knight people went batnanas for it so when the dark knight came out it had a lot to live up to,the dark knight didn't just live up to batman begins it blew EVERYBODY'S expectations away
and why is that well ill tell you,duh.
first off the casting for this movie is flawless.some of the people from the first movie reprise their roles (Christian Bale,Michael Caine,Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman)they all gave performances just as good as batman begins(which is amazing) the new casting choices are all Oscar worthy
Heath Ledger as one of the best villains of time ever in anything,the Joker
Aaron Eckhart as Harvey dent(another amazing performance)
Maggie Gyllenhaal does just as good a job as Katie Holmes did with the Previous installment playing Rachel Dawes.
if your a kid and you watch this movie you will pp and poo poo yourself every time the Joker is on screen
the bank robbery scene is intense,the meeting with the mob,incredibly intense
and heath ledger put everything in to the role of the joker making it his own thing you've never seen a joker that looks or sounds like heath Leadger's
usually when a character doesn't have a motivation in a movie its a sin but Christopher Nolan has reached into his magic bag once again because the fact that he has no motivation and it works is amazing.
the cinematography is great,the music composed by Hans Zimmer is always amazing ,the writing is phenomenal and the acting is 10/10
once again Christopher Nolan has proved he is one of the greatest directors who has ever lived.",1
"I look at the Fincher's movies like a film school . as a filmmaker you can learn lots about directing , filming , lighting , custom , blocking and etc. than a school with formal lessons .
Just watch it like you have to find out something important in film's details .Behrouz Bagheri.",1
"Classic good movie, Batman, clown are very good. The classic example of the two boatmen, each ship has a button to blow up the other ship to save themselves, and is not allowed to jump ship to escape, press or not press. In the end, both boatmen chose not to act. Human nature is not always good, but it is not so dark.",1
This is a must see classic movie. I love Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I could watch this movie 20 times and not mind.,1
"What faces Gotham is a nihilistic movement spearheaded by Bane and assisted by capitalist interests and bankers. It starts with an assault on the Stock Exchange, continues with the theft of a nuclear device, and leads up to a familiar countdown to annihilation. Bane represents himself as a liberator but he's really a destroyer, a deceiver of a weak, easily misled populace. The contemporary parallels are clear, though the underlying politics are somewhat confused. One supposes that Nolan's views are not unlike Shakespeare's (or Dickens's) - a loathing of people acting as a mob, a deep suspicion of politicians and a belief in the preservation of social order in a fluctuating world.",1
"Inception is not only visually pleasing but mentally pleasing. Every aspect of it is awesome, the story is superb and twisted. Which is GREAT! The movie is really interesting, and reminds me of ""The Prestige"" 2009, which has a great twist in the end, like this.Probably the best Movie I have ever seen is Inception. It had a great soundtrack, and again, amazing story. A must see! I understood the film the first time around but others may need to pay to see it a few more times, but trust me, ITS WORTH IT! Inception never looses it's mystery aspect.Acting is also top notch along with directing and CGI. Defiantly, if you haven't already, go see Inception RIGHT NOW!",1
"How can you say it surpassed Batman Begins in all ways, I was disappointed because it wasn't nearly as good as the last film. It lacked a plot at times, dragged on and the whole two face bit was a waste of time. It had potential to be a really good film but it just didn't cut it for me. Shorten the film and remove two face (alternatively not kill him off to set him up for the next film) and it could be brilliant. It certainly doesn't deserve to be in the top 10 films of all time, in fact I wouldn't put it in the top 250. Don't get me wrong, there were some good scenes and Ledgers performance was brilliant making it a good film, but certainly not as good as some people are making it out to be.",1
"Greatttt
Errrr... I guess that's supposed to be enemies. But in any case, who needs those extra nice-to-",1
"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this amazing film? Everything about it is superb. Everything from the acting to the script is one of the most amazing pieces of work to ever hit the screen.Now I know it is an old film, but it was a classic from the instant it was made and nothing was going to change that as it had the ingredient of a outstanding achievement that any parent would be proud of.If you struggle to watch this film, then you must struggle with life in general. I mean even the colour grading and attention to detail was just brilliant and like I said, I cannot say anything else about it that someone wouldn't have already said, apart from, if every film was as good as this, I would never go out again.",1

"i'm grateful for this movie , because the feeling after i finished it was a new feeling , its more then satisfying. the movie show you what happens if you never give up and how to enjoy living your live even in the worst Circumstances. the actors were perfect. there is nothing to say people didn't say it,shortly The Shawshank Redemption deserve to be in top ten best movies.",1
"The Dark Knight, truly is dark and raw, it digs deep and provokes. Going in, I knew it was gonna be dark, but with this Shakespearian/Hamlet tragedy, it becomes so much more entirely. The movie deals so seamlessly with the ideas of human nature, psychological core, emotions of hate, revenge, torture, angst, betrayal, sadness. The action is notched up, and boy does it deliver. From the opening scene to the final scene, you will be spell-binded. You really don't know what's gonna happen next!Bale delivers a heartfelt performance, Oldman shines, ECKHART is amazing at the end, and of course Ledger well was the Joker himself. I couldn't even get past that the man behind the makeup was Heath. His character is absolute, but very complex, in that, credit to writers, his actions paradoxically have so much meaning. He too symbolizes an ideal, anarchy, and does so breathlessly illustrating his view of the world, that provokes and delivers some forbidden truth. The mythical, tragic overtones, themes, and character arcs make this film a masterpiece. Amazing, amazing, amazing.",1
A movie that put the definition of superhero genre,1
"A truly magnificent film for any film fan. Its harsh reality of the criminal justice system in twentieth century America captivates your curiosity. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman two criminals convicted to remain in the confines of Shawshank for life. Both men emanate opposing ends of society, in that Tim is beaten savagely by prisoners learning that life in prison was bitter. Morgan Freeman recognises Tim's need to survive, striking up a friendship that eventually, with time, benefits other prisoners are left to rot. It's more than one man, but its the depiction of struggle and determination emanating from the film adaptation of Stephen King's story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'that anyone could be face in our lives.A must see film that will change 160 minutes of your life.",1
"The shawshank redemption is a movie directed by Frank Darabont,and it came out on 1994.The movie is about a man (Andy Dufresne) who is supposedly guilty of killing his wife and the lover. When he arrives to prison,Andy is very shy and quiet.But after a month he decides to talk,and meet some friends,especially Red (Morgan Freeman).During the time in prison he realize the hard situation there,and corruption.However Andy gets through that and face the difficulties.Because his life out of the prison as a banker,Andy becomes a very important prisoner in shawshank. Its a very recommended movie,because it shows how is the life in prison,different but no far from reality.Also the movie give us a very good lesson:""Sooner or later,the truth always comes out""",1
"this movie was beyond good, beyond excellent. it is one of those films where you want to see it over and over again, and I am being totally literal. The only thing that I have to say, is that it started out a little slow, but heck with that, the film was brilliant. Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker, was unbelievably fantastic, if you didn't know that actor, you wouldn't know that it was him at all, specially with all the make-up on. it's said that a movie is only as good as it's villain, so this movie is obviously, amazing. Also, I am one to listen to soundtracks, and this is a very good one. although a lot of it does sound like the first one, just because it is the Dark Knight, makes it better. I already have two of the songs on my i-pod, now I don't just love them because they are from the Dark Knight, I love them because they are very well done, thanks to Hans Zimmer. As well as Heath Ledgers Joker, the rest of the cast (Gary Oldman, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Micheal Cane) it just makes it so overwhelmingly fantastic.For sure, you will be seeing Dark Knight all over the Oscars.",1
"Fight Club definitely has style and is exciting to watch, with complex characters driven by their actions and a great plot twist at the end. The actors were all good, and Fincher does a good job of maintaining consistency in what's really happening and showing the narrator's perspective. As always with adaptations, some interesting exposition in details is lost, such as how exactly Tyler did his work at night and how Project Mayhem worked. The ending, which is so beloved, works and makes sense but isn't exceptional. Why does Tyler die when the narrator shoots his cheek - because he finally takes control of his life, because he's no longer afraid? It's plausible and there's nothing wrong with it, but it certainly didn't blow me away. There are plenty of good themes, and the contrasts of Tyler and the narrator as opposing extremes in problems with society were enjoyable to consider. I don't think there was anything wrong with Fight Club, but I also don't think it's anything more than a decent movie with a good twist.",1
"There's nothing else to say, a must. To not see this movie is a travesty to film. Do yourself a favour and watch.",1
It has set a example for other directors how high the benchmark should be set.Perfect Picture and great actors.Morgan Freeman has done a great job which lifts the films to next level.No words of the Hero acting he was perfect and wonderful in acting.Good Title for the movie made a stand alone title.Explains us anything can be if we have a clear plan and nothing is impossible.Each and everyday help us to get better once its planned.,1
The best film that i ve ever watched. I recommend for EVRYONE,1
Amazing title that holds valid even to this day. Great lead performers and actors.,1
"Leonardo decaprio was good in the movie, some trippy scenes were cool and the inception in the dreams are cool watching.",1
"I've really enjoyed Christopher Nolan's reinvention of Batman. I recently saw Batman Begins and I thought it was the best Batman movie of the series.The origin story was handled very well for such a loved comic book superhero. And now, Batman is back! The Dark Knight centres around Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale), Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman)and new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) trying to track down the crazed and murderous psychopath, The Joker (Heath Ledger) and stop him from causing chaos and havoc in Gotham City.The Dark Knight is not only one of the best movies of 2008 so far, it very well might be the best superhero movie yet. The performances in the film are terrific and serve the story well. The best actor has to be Heath Ledger as The Joker.In my opinion, he's the best actor to have portrayed and capture the philosophy of the character. He's really put his stamp on it and made it his own. It's horrible that he didn't live to see what a fantastic job he's done. He deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.After seeing The Dark Knight, I can't wait for the next Batman movie, that's how great this film is! 9/10",1
"This movie is plain and simple...amazing and terrific. It is hands down the best movie I have seen all year. I enjoyed every minute of it and hoped it would never end. Heath Ledger did an amazing job and I am upset over his death. He could have done more great movies and great things in his lifetime. How they killed Rachel was harsh but real. Aaron Eckhart's role as Harvey Dent was awesome acting. I also think that the #1 on the Top 250, isn't an exaggeration. It was without a doubt worth my time and money. I thought that Heath Ledger's acting was also amazing. He brought a creepy, silliness to the screen. Him disguised as a nurse got a chuckle out of me. Everyone in this movie did a great job in both acting and film making. I enjoyed every minute of this film and hope to see more Batman.",1
"One of my favorite movies! First, it was a clean movie, no nudity, it was captivating, held my interest to see what was going to happen, one of the top movies in my collection. There are few movies anymore that keep the plot clean with no nudity, I understand sex sells; but I would rather watch a clean movie over some movie that contains so much nudity that your children can't watch. Again, its captivating, I didn't know what was going to happen next, Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors, he played his part well, the film rates high on my chart! It makes you think of how many innocent people are actually doing time in jail for something then didn't do. Unbelievable to think he used that rock hammer to dig to his freedom. Sadly, it made me think of how many people cannot adjust to the outside world after being in prison for so many years, they committed suicide or committed another crime just so they could be sent back to prison. It does bring up those thoughts, I am very impressed that the plot held my attention and two thumbs up for choosing the perfect cast!",1
"I think we face double dilemma in film industry at the moment. More the people watch fake copies, less the good movies are produced and as much overrated they are. Just like last years Avatar this movie is surely best of the year and it really offers a lot in terms of entertainment. On the other hand when we are talking about 9's and full 10's I am sorry but there should be a social benefit or at least a slight humanitarian message which this movie does not include. In terms of cinematography it really satisfies me. The director is a true inspiration for all who want to involve in film business, always provocative, revolutionist and surely creative. The casting can be evaluated as a huge success but I am sure an elderly looked hero such as Russel Crowe or similar would have fit into Cobb role more ( even though Di Caprio was outstanding). Visual effects and sound are truly brilliant ( I expect 2 technical academy awards) , the plot itself has some ups and downs but it is not fair to discuss every detail in the scenario rationally. Finally this is a movie with a cause of entertainment and it fully serves its cause.",1
"One of Christopher Nolan's best films to date. People don't seem to understand the concept of proper screenwriting. I personally believe this is exactly what this is.Ladies and Gentleman, screenwriting at its best, even all the way to 2019.",1
"I honestly think that Christopher Nolan is incapable of making a bad film. I mean let's look back on his work. ""Batman Begins"" was a fantastic reboot to the ""Batman"" franchise. And ""The Dark Knight"" was absolutely amazing! As a matter of fact, ""The Dark Knight"" is in my opinion the #2 best movie ever made. His other work includes ""The Prestige"", ""Memento"", and ""Insomnia"" and all of those were fantastic! Anyway, now let's talk about ""Inception"".This movie is absolutely mind blowing. The storyline was very original. One of the most original story lines I've seen in a very long time. The whole concept of accessing people's dreams and the whole idea of the process they call inception was very well thought out. The visuals were also simply amazing. The visuals in ""Inception"" made ""The Matrix"" look like a backyard movie. And the ending is... Well, I'm not gonna spoil it but it's pretty awesome. The whole movie has you thinking for days after you've seen it. It's a movie worth seeing twice. The acting was also fantastic. Nolan put together a perfect ensemble of a cast. I also saw this movie twice. Once in standard 35mm and IMAX. No matter what format you see it in, it's spectacular. Kudos to you Christopher Nolan. You've blown us all away once again.",1
"Great movie I was on the edge of my seat, wish they would have come out with a number 2",1
This movie was mind blowing. I went to see this with very high expectations and they were fulfilled this movie was just perfect in every way. The story brilliant I mean how did Nolan even come up with this. The special effects mind blowing. The complexity was not as bad as I thought it would be. I mean this movie is fantastic I say you should go see this movie now who cares if it is alittle complicated just go see this movie. I have not seen to many good films this year this movie and shutter island are my favorite so far this year. Clash of the Titan very high expectations but I still liked that movie a lot. The last airbender you know what people hated that movie. I liked it even though it had the worst acting I have seen in a movie in god knows how long. I am just saying there are not a lot of good movies right now. You want a good movie either go buy shutter island or go see Inception. Trust me Inception is a really good movie. Don't miss out on this movie.,1
"Christopher Nolan's Inception is fast, witty, beautiful, action-packed and emotional. But what makes this movie more special is the fact that you are in a dream and you can do anything in a dream... There came many astounding moments in the movie when I was very sure that the movie will fail and lose it's track, but it never does. Inception is a rare combination of art and entertainment. It is extremely rich in both the elements. I will blindly recommend this to anyone. If you compare this to movies like Silence of the Lambs, Lord of the Rings, Pan's Labyrinth or Godfather, Inception proves to have better thrills and stuns. It is the only movie in my opinion where possibilities of winning are very thin and you are almost convinced that we are not gonna make it. And the ending... wow that's the best I have ever seen in any movie and that's the best part! Wally Pfister's cinematography and Han's Zimmer's electronic score makes Inception feel like Inception. Go...Give it a try!",1
Three years ago a friend of mine offered to watch Batman Begins at theater and I said OK but I didn't expect anything but overblown effects and a boring childish scenario. I'm not a fan of Batman and I usually don't like superhero movies or comic book adaptations. But it was something different than I expected. It was not built upon the simple ideas of other superhero movies and the way the movie told us the story of the protagonist was quite realistic. So it changed my prejudiced opinion on Batman.Depending on the success of the first movie I was eager to see The Dark Knight. Especially after seeing the photos of Heath Ledger as Joker.This time the story is darker and it exceeds the well-known Hollywood clichés. Characters are genuinely crafted and the cast is superb. Christian Bale is the best Batman ever and Heath Ledger as Joker is shocking. Script is the best I've ever seen in a this kind of movie. It shows the fight of good and evil in a quite realistic way and as it is in real life you see there's a thin line between the two. Christopher Nolan's point of view shows that things are not that easy and the good characters are not invincible. And not always there happy endings. The movie makes you feel Gotham is a city possessed by crime and it is as dark as Batman himself.Also I was really satisfied by the ending of the movie but most of my friends said it could be better. But my opinion is the ending was great.The last thing I couldn't control myself to tell is the tricks of Joker. They made me smile sadistically while watching them. He's completely chaotic and a real psychopath.Go and see the movie whether you like or don't like Batman. At least you'll surely love and admire Heath's performance as Joker...,1
"The second you start watching this movie you know that this is something you will remember whether that be excellent acting on part of the entire cast. The special effects or the amazingly in depth plot line that will captivate you all the way until the amazing climax that literally had me,on the edge of my chair. If you don't get this movie then you, have no imagination. DiCaprio deserve every award Hollywood can give an actor for this role and his co-star Cotillard deserves just as much to give you the illusion of a relationship that as the viewer cannot imagine or even begin to. With the fabulous Hans Zimmer for the musical score this is best film you will see all summer.",1
"It definitely EXCEEDED ALL of my expectations. It goes further than a typical Batman movie, and a huge improvement over the first one. Digs deep into the human psyche, reference to terror, government, psychology, and leaves us with many thoughts and conversations once the movie is done. Heath Ledger played his role of the Joker amazingly extremely well, and brings out the sinister,yet joking, scary side that Joker's supposed to be. Christopher Nolan is an amazing director, and it's sad that Heath Ledger cannot appear for a third installment. There isn't a clear bad, good guy, and the complex issue of human character and how each character brings it out is commendable. Definitely the best movie of the summer, and perhaps the first greatest movie since 2008 started. This movie's intense, packed, and makes you sit on the edge of your seat, and to get it is needed to watch more than once. I recommend for everyone to go see it!",1
"I will say there were some amazing special effects, and action scenes, but overall, ""Inception"" left me bored. This is most likely due to the fact that the movie is close to nothing but 3 hours of fending off enemies that are nothing but nameless faceless ""white blood cells"" defending the subconscious. It just felt like it dragged on forever. That along with the fact that I felt zero attachment to the characters in the movie and an overly ridged dreamscapes made this film feel horridly sterile. Not to mention, the film felt very jumpy. As in it jumps from scene to scene to scene every few minutes. In fact, the film may have been trying to pull off a feat so grand, that it leaves you thinking its all just a big jumbled mess not worth the frustration of following. I can deal with a complex film, but I feel that the jumping around to all the scenes occurring simultaneously made the film lose focus. In other words, I watched the movie play out, but it did not pull me into it. I was a detached viewer, no emotional involvement whatsoever. On top of that, the film was honestly very predictable and had very little in the revelation department. You could always see the tracks before the train went over them so to speak. One aspect of the movie that just completely dumbfounded me was that the film managed to be both imaginative, yet uncreative at the same time. There is so much potential for creativity in a movie about dreaming, but this film decided to make the dreams seem more like virtual reality then actual dreams.However, the biggest disappointment of this movie is the fact that everyone claimed it was an intelligent thinking mans film. This film has not exercised one bit of critical thinking in my mind. It feels overly superficial and hardly a film that can spark deep philosophical debate. After watching ""Inception"" it did not have me contemplating the big questions in life one bit. When it ended, it ended, and that was that.",1
"Definitely my favorite film of all time. Suspensefiul, funny, action packed and thrilling film that takes some unexpected twists and turns",1
"Filme incrível, narrativa impecável e os atores são maravilhosos.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption (1994): Dir: Frank Darbont / Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, William Sadler: Gripping film about finding refuge in a place of despair. Tim Robbins plays banker Andy Dufresne in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. The verdict is not the issue, but rather his familiarizing himself into routine life within prison walls. He faces the trials of violent leering inmates but forms a bond with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. Redding can get things for a price and soon Andy has items smuggled into his cell. Andy finds favor when his banking comes into play and doing taxes for the corrupt Christian warden and the guards. Andy is able to improve the library but discovers a scheme by the warden that leaves him to his own devices when proof of his innocence is sabotaged. Director Frank Darabont paints the grim and depressing portrait of prison and populates it with personalities struggling to exist within. Robbins is at his best as a victim adapting and improving his circumstance before intelligence wins out. Freeman is great as the humble and resourceful Redding. James Whitmore plays aged librarian Brooks whose release leads to questions regarding freedom verses existence. Bob Gunton is effective as the ruthless warden. Redemption is freedom of mind and soul whether in prison or in opportunity. Score: 10 / 10",1
"Nolan attained cult status in Hollywood owing to his master screenplay and narrative in movies like Memento(2002). And his vision of the Batman series was a spectacle that both the fans and non-fans of the series' enjoyed alike. Now Nolan through his imagination has brought us a journey into the world of imagination itself. Inception is about the world of the dream and how to hack into your dreams? as well as others. Central to the plot is a piece of tech, developed by the army, which enables people to share dreams. This is what Cobb(Dicaprio) and his associates use to commit mental heists. Cobb lands a job that needs him, not to steal an idea from someone's mind, but to place one there instead and make it seem self-generated by the subject himself. You can do that? This has never been done before but Cobb needs to do this to get back to his children.This movie is not of the sit-back, relax and enjoy genre. It is fast paced and does not wait for you to understand what just happened. Unless you are totally alert, you will get lost. You have to keep track of dreams within dreams and it is not abundantly clear how things actually work in the dream world. But the ten years that Nolan has supposedly put into the film definitely paid off. He masterfully communicates his vision with the audience. The plot has a lot of gaps which the viewer himself has to fill to make the narrative congruent. So this is definitely going to stay on your mind for a while even after you leave the theater. The movie is visually stunning. The CG is seamless and top notch. All the actors render laudable performances. My favorite definitely though is Eames(Tom Hardy). He is a professional thief and an expert forger and extremely cool. But Nolan is no expert at directing fight scenes. They do tend to wear you out as they are not very exciting in themselves. The movie definitely has quite a number of inconsistencies too. This surely must have been due to the short window of time in which Nolan had to present everything about this new world from conception to conclusion. All in all this is a must watch for people who want to challenge their intellect. And as I've said before this not for one's with a faint heart as you might find yourself bored or completely confused unless you are extremely alert.",1
"Nolan, the cinematic genius is back. Once again he sets the bar of mainstream commercial cinema so high that most other contemporary filmmakers will be forced to ""copy"" him soon enough, I am afraid. Dom Cobb played by DiCaprio is a futuristic thief and steals your thoughts and even manipulates them all through your dreams. And now he gets an assignment of his life time. The one that he has been waiting for. While working on that he has to face his personal demons as well. That pretty much sums up the basic story line. Yes, it's all about dreams. But this is not a popcorn movie or dating movie or an action movie or a disaster movie. I would even go even further and say that it is not your ""usual"" block buster movie either. This is a serious science fiction movie, with plenty of mind games involved, in typical Nolan way. But again it's not the sci-fi that we have seen till now. There are no weird looking space ships or matter-antimatter-integrators or subspace transistors (remember starwars techno babbles?). The dialogs make sense and has been written keeping in mind that people will actually listen to them and try to understand what in god's name they are saying. Just like Nolan improvised the character of The Joker in his previous outing, here he completely (in many scenes literally!) overturns the very idea of alternate reality in movies. Well, the story can be explained pretty much in one sentence. But in reality the idea has been executed brilliantly and has many sub layers if you pay attention. It is much more complex than TDK, or Requem for a dream or Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind. I compared Inception with the latter 2 movies because they try to make the viewers aware of the mindset of the characters as much as possible through the setting, dialog, camera angles and the background score, something can be attributed to Matrix I only partially. I think Inception as well can be included in this category although each of them are different in their own way.Now before going to watch the film, expect 'AS MUCH AS' possible. Still, I guarantee you that you will come out exceeding it just as I did. And calm yourself just like you do before writing an exam or a meditation or yoga. Be ready to absorb all the emotions and dialogs as the film goes through so many layers and realities. There are some breathtaking visuals through out the film created using CGI, they are there only because they are needed there. I know I am off the limit, I just want you to experience the film in the same way I experienced it. Second viewing should help. I myself am preparing for that. Every other aspect of the film is just as perfect, Acting topnotch, Story excellent, CGI best available on par with 2012. All in all this is THE film that you have been waiting from Christopher Nolan after TDK. Watch how perfection is redefined.",1
"Nice job Frank, very nice.
And the writers offcourse.",1
Really love the batman attitude and this is the best movie ever!,1
"It's a great long movie, so far one of the best movie I've seen. Batman is cool, Joker acts perfectly. The technology inside of the movie is really cool. Fantastic story, definitely worth to watch. Good. Great anyway. Nice film. They filmed very well, I like it. Overall it's good. You will feel regret if you don't watch it.",1
"Christopher Nolan has a vision. And whether you agree with it or not, he undeniably completes it in ""The Dark Knight""--a vicious, engrossing, overwhelming, intelligent event- film that re-defines 'comic-book-flicks'. In Nolan's grim, dark-depiction of Gotham-City (the crime-ridden hell protected by legendary superhero Batman), the director strives to make everything real (something he began in the well-received ""Batman Begins""). He makes it plausible, possible. And yet there's more to it: just as 'Begins' was a dissection of myth, the nature of symbols and heroes, 'Knight' is the escalation of that notion. It's a biblical- confrontation of 'good-and-evil', yet as 'good-and-evil' really exist: a conflict of ideals, something that can't be purely-defined but that is relative to a viewpoint. In Nolan's world, the line of villainy and heroism isn't crossed... it's non-existent. The bad-guys don't see themselves as bad-guys, and as such something so unnervingly-real comes across it might fly past some people's minds (no insult to anybody, it's just common that people don't look deep into 'popcorn-flicks'): the battle is a complete ambiguity.The film runs at nearly 2.5-hours, yet never ceases to lose interest or momentum. It doesn't waste a scene or moment; every event is utilized and necessary. 'The Dark Knight' tells a story worth telling and it takes the proper amount of time to tell it. Action-sequences are frantic, old-school, eye-grabbing stunts (vastly superior to 'Begins') and in their chaotic intensity we see that they serve purpose to the story, yet more interesting are not played for pure entertainment-value: we are meant to watch, petrified, simply hoping that the outcome will go the hero's way. Attention is never lost because we are immersed in a breathtaking, almost completely-unpredictable story (it packs many a shock), that makes us think and more importantly gains our emotional-investment. We come to care for the characters, because they are believable, developed, and personified fully.Everyone has great-chemistry together. Maggie Gyllenhal is a more mature Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes. Morgan Freeman provides his authoritative presence to the role of bad- gadget-inventor/Wayne-Enterprise CEO Lucius Fox, and under anyone else's portrayal, the part would be less-memorable. Gary Oldman underplays his world-wearied lawman with such honest-nobility, you never feel for a second any of its forced-acting. The irreplaceable Michael Caine makes a gentle, reassuring, father-like presence as Alfred, and the movie would surely fail without his strong-presence and interjected-moments of light-humor.And while everyone (rightfully) pours the praise unto Bale and Ledger, I think most are glancing-over Knight's breakout-performance. As Harvey Dent, Aaron Eckhart does more than hold himself in the company of such a renowned-cast. He makes his presence known, whether he's playing on the easy-going charisma of Gotham's 'White-Knight' or the broken and damaged, twisted-soul of Two-Face. He achieves a full-impact with the tragedy that comes unto his character, and so closely connects with Dent, that he makes his pain tangible for us: we sympathize even as we become terrified. He captures both facets of each personality flawlessly.Now, some people cite that 'Knight' has a potential fatal-flaw in the supposedly wooden- acting of Christian Bale. Admittedly, his development is not as grand as in 'Begins' (yet that film gave us such a good psychoanalysis of Wayne, we hardly need more), yet what Bale pulls off is admirable. Wayne is not an eccentric personality. He is a disillusioned man who can hardly find any joy in having no family, giving up his love-interest and spending his life fighting a battle that may never end. He's dark and conflicted, and Bale plays up on that brooding-mood by making Wayne look as though a thousand dark-things were on his mind. He's not wooden...he's a humorless, quiet individual. Even when Wayne is acting as a frivolous playboy for the public, every now and then Bale offers us a powerful glance that reminds us its all a façade; that deep down, something more disturbed irks him. Occasionally he offers a broken-smile when exchanging banter with Alfred, letting us know that beyond the dour depression of the Caped-Crusader lies a damaged human-being. It is only in the guise of a growling masked-man, that he can unleash his true, ferocious personality.Finally, who could forget Heath Ledger. Now, when he was first-announced for the part, I was (along with many other people) asking myself: ""Why?"". Mr. Ledger had proved with 'Brokeback Mountain' he could deliver a potent performance. But he hadn't before. It is only, after seeing this film, that I know the answer to 'why?': I see the significance of his loss.When Heath appears in this movie, he is completely unrecognizable. His voice is distinctly-altered; a near-whiny, pedophile-like tone that sends shivers down the spine. His face is completely splattered with makeup that renders him both freakishly-nightmarish and strangely-funny. And when you see him, you don't think it's him. In this, his final performance, Ledger proved he was a chameleon. His two iconic performances in this, and 'Brokeback', could not be more different. I am convinced he could have been anything in his career. He commits so intensely to character that the line of actor/portrayal dies. His every tick and gesture only further-enhances his character. Heath never hams the role up or goes for something cheap: he delivers a fully-immersed display of psychotic madness...or do we just label him that to feel safer? The movie writes the character brilliantly; blending terrifying truth into his every social-accusation, and making us question why we laugh at his sick-jokes.'The Dark Knight' has had an incredible-amount of hype running for it, from the get-go, mounting ever-higher, until Heath Ledger's too-soon death. And the finished-product does more than exceed all of the near-impossible expectations placed on it. It becomes something much richer than a super-hero-franchise-saga. Christopher Nolan has opened a new door in cinema: allowing action-flicks to become more serious, capable of intelligence. He has transformed this into a piece of artwork, full of beauty, terror, moral-conundrums. This movie has changed things...forever.",1
"Being a Dark Knight fan of the comics for many decades, Batman in its true format, was NOT a comedy or a representation of anything that came out prior to Batman Returns. The TV sitcom was a joke. Tim Burton missed the context of Batman in its entirety. Finally, Christopher Nolan brings out the true essence of Batman, and its a wonder how so many people miss the context of what Batman represents. Even the vast majority of professional critics missed the true meaning of Batman.There is a much deeper, allegorical meaning about Batman itself that has been perfectly recreated in The Dark Knight that makes this movie surpass any movie ever created. The Dark Knight is a work of true ingeniousness, far more complex, contemporary, poignant and relevant than any movie ever made. If you miss what its trying to say, then you are left without any ability to understand why people are raving about this movie. But that's precisely the point. Too many people have forgotten how to think.Do you believe that Gotham City represents a fictional city? Do you believe that Batman and the Joker are based upon fictional characters? Then you missed the meaning behind Batman.The Dark Knight is a true work of genius. Its the complete war of two diametrically opposite ideas that work in our system of western culture and its extension to other concepts as well. Its a war between liberalism and conservatism. Its NOT only a war between good and evil that most people think. Not by a long shot. Gotham City represents the disease of liberalism gone amok. The fact that liberalism is guilty of graying out the dividing borders between good and evil has been fully established within our own societies. Look at our legal system! The guilty are treated far better than the victims. We have made the perpetrator the victim and the victim the guilty within the system of law. What is good becomes bad, what is bad becomes good. This is what Gotham City represents.Batman represents the conservative position to hold to what is right no matter what, and the Joker represents the conservative position of holding on to what is evil to the maximum. Its true that the statement there is a fine line between a genius and madness applies within The Dark Knight. Now lets take a good look at parts of the movie.During the robbery, we know that the Joker has no allies, he has his own agenda and doesn't have a conscience whatsoever. This fact is also represented by the ""pencil trick"" where his actions to himself was nothing more than a simple act that meant absolutely nothing to him. The Joker is immune to death or remorse. He plays by his own rules of madness, but is in perfect control of his extraordinary intelligence. What delights the Joker more than anything is to create sadistic moral dilemmas for everyone, criminal or not. To the Joker, Batman is the complete antithesis of who he is, but so much alike in determination to stand separate from apathy towards right and wrong.In the scene where Harvey Dent goes before the crowd and the crowd wants Batman to reveal himself because of the moral dilemma that the Joker created to weaken Batman's resolve, the crowd cries out for the Batman to succumb to the Joker's demands. This is pure liberalism at its best. Personally I believe its a disease of the mind. The inability to think rationally. We find this in our country where people cry out to stop the war that's going on in our world. Pure madness. How so you may ask? In the Joker's context, its so easy to see. Why? You can clearly see that he is a madman of epic proportions so you understand WHO the Joker is and what he represents. Know your enemy. The vast majority of people don't have a clue what the enemies true intension's are in this world. People refuse to see and believe that different mind sets exist within our world and how to understand them. Its there for people to see, but they don't see.In the movie, someone wants to save others by revealing who Batman is, but who defends the secrecy of Batman? The Joker. The Joker isn't interested in who Batman is at all. It was all about breaking Batman's resolve and using the public to revolt against him. Its absolute brilliance!You think two face has gone mad? Think about it. Use your brains! Harvey Dent stood for the conservative position that defied Gotham City completely. He stood for what is right. Absolutely. He understood that if his position was compromised, the legal system would be so corrupt that the flip of a coin exceeded the values of justice more than the liberal legal system that prevailed. Fifty-fifty odds were better than anything available. How true is this today in our world.Batman stands as enigma towards our world today. If you stand up for what is right and fight for it, you are condemned by the very people you protect. If you do nothing to prevent evil from spreading, like liberalism is guilty of, then you become weak and useless to stand against the tide of evil that is certain to overwhelm this world.I loved the ferry scene. Think about it. If you knew anything about the Joker, you would have realized that each boat had detonators, but being consistent to the Joker's mindset, each boat would have had the detonator that would have blown up their own boats, not the other. Its remarkable that no one clued in to this. I guess I know the Joker better than others.This only touches the surface of how deep The Dark Knight goes. Its far deeper and meaningful than any other movie ever created.It takes brains to understand Batman. Use it.",1
"The performances are good. DiCaprio is properly anguished, Marion Cotillard does well as his tormented wife, and Nolan's good-luck charm Michael Caine brings his trademark charisma to a throwaway role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who's always good, is permitted to contribute a few (very few) lighter moments to an otherwise deadly serious narrative. Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Dileep Rao complete DiCaprio's ""team,"" adding life and color to the ensemble.But the result, for me, is a muddle. Even at the early press screening I attended, I heard cries of ""Brilliant!"", so I know my opinion won't be shared by everyone. I admire Christopher Nolan's ambition and intelligence, but I don't think it's necessary to jump through endless hoops to tell a good story, or to digest one. I'm of the ""less is more"" school, but Nolan and his followers apparently believe that more is better.",1
"This movie is one the best movies I have seen ever. If you don't watch this movie yet, just watch it.",1
"This is not a bad film per se, had it been about 30-40 minutes shorter I would not have been too offended. But I'm genuienly perplexed as to how people can rave over it-#13 on all time list at time of writing!! There is virtually no character devlopment the plot overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions. Frankly you don't need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet. By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsence rules - any thing to get me out of that chair.",1
This is a film everyone should watch. Its dark and thrilling,1
"Yes, Fight Club is controversial. It is also violent, gory and deliberately cheap.Furthermore, it is one of the most poignant depictions of materialism and human nature in film history.From start to finish, it is loaded with sarcastic remarks on today's society. There are so many visual hooks and catchy thrills that you won't get away with watching it just once.Essentially, Fight Club is a story about consumerism. The main character, brilliantly played by Edward Norton, is a victim of the society's requirement to make a lot of money and then spend it on furniture and other false delights. He cannot sleep and he doesn't have any real friends.Once his material fortune is destroyed by a fire, he has no choice but to turn to Tyler Durden, an alpha-male who lives in a dirty squat and makes soap for living. Tyler is the character Brad Pitt was born to play.Then there's Helena Bonham Carter as the tortured misfit who can't make her mind up on anything.And that's about everything that can ethically be reveal about the plot. You have to see the film yourself and get impressed, time after time.There are no guarantees that you will love Fight Club. A load of people have been angered by it. In my opinion, that's exactly the film's forte. Whatever you think of it, you will think something of it, and you will never forget what you've seen.Some have criticized it for being pro-violence. I have no patience for their point of view. Fight Club is a hugely ironic portrait of human mind taking a wrong turn. If anything, it's strictly against any form of violence, mental or physical.David Fincher has directed revolutionary music videos for Aerosmith and Madonna, among others, as well as some formidable thrillers, such as The Game and Panic Room. Here, he outdoes himself. He jam-packs the flick with genius visual clues and lines Tarantino should envy.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time. I love the story and the cast and settings of the movie. I have seen the movie many times, and each time I enjoy it more and more. I love Stephen King's original story, and the way the movie script sticks closely to this. All of the characters shine, especially Andy and Red. The message of hope in the story has kept me strong over the years.I have a big question. In the ""facts"" list the music which Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) plays over the P.A. system with the door to the warden's office locked -- it says the music is ""Duettino Sull'Aria or Sull'aria the Soave Zeffaretto from the Marriage of Figaro by Mozart. This is not true. The ORIGINAL music Andy plays is THE FLOWER DUET from the opera LAKME by Debiles!!! MY QUESTION IS IF this is the original music...why and when was there a change in this music?. The Flower Duet is indeed the most inspiring and beautiful music ever composed and fits very well with the stunning remarks in Morgan Freeman's Thought/monologue. MY QUESTION IS what music is written in the book, if it is or was it the choice of the director. or writer? Does anyone have the actual book??? I emailed Rich Caparella of the classic station KUSC since he planned to play THE FLOWER DUET on his program and he replied that he found it quite interesting and assumed the problem was concerning rights and contracts to play the music. But why the cover-up??? I will not rest till I find out the truth about this, because it kind of ruins the whole movie if that music has been changed. The duet by Mozart is not inspiring AT ALL really compared to The Flower Duet, likely the most beautiful music ever composed. Simon Wilby simonwilby.com",1
"Is The Dark Night the best movie of all time? On IMDb.com, a popular movie database with over 300,000 members ranging from occasional moviegoers to film producers and financiers, The Dark Night has vaulted over The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption as the #1 movie of all time. The rankings, an accumulation of user votes that are generally more favourable to the great modern movies than those of the Silver Screen era, have, in the past, been prone to such invasions ? The Return of the King debuted at #3 before settling into its current position at #14 ? but in the 10 years that I have used to the site to build up my vast wealth of movie trivia knowledge, I have never seen a film as universally well received as The Dark Knight. Consider the demographic breakdown of the votes: As expected, males under 30 love the movie, with the under-18 male crowd giving the movie an average ranking of 9.7 out of 10. A more unexpected result is 8.0 out of 10 average score among females over 45, an astounding number for a Batman movie.So is The Dark Knight potentially the greatest film ever made and can a question like that be asked and answered less than a week after the film made its debut? Most of us have a favourite movie. The question is, when does a person realize that their favourite movie is their favourite movie? For me, I knew right away. I watched Lawrence of Arabia for the first time, after ordering the video during the infamous days of Columbia House, and instantly fell in love. I have never seen, then or since, a movie of such visual depth, and the main characters in the film were aged, experienced politicians and monarchs, wise to the world and aware of the complexities of life. When they spoke, they revealed an understanding that few men achieve, none more so than Prince Feisal, who tells us that, ""Young men make wars, and the virtues of war are the virtues of young men: courage, and hope for the future. Then old men make the peace, and the vices of peace are the vices of old men: mistrust and caution."". The story of the World War I Arab revolt in the dessert is of important historical significance, and even if the film is a largely fictional representation, Lawrence of Arabia is a vital piece of art.I digress, back to The Batman. Reading through various blogs, I find the Internet buzzing. Film critics have almost universally proclaimed the movie to be a highly entertaining piece of Crime Fiction, but they hold their cards close to their chests. No self-respecting critic, after years of studying 1000s of films, will anoint last weekend's Hollywood blockbuster as the new King of Cinema. Even The Godfather, easily the favourite film of the Baby Boomer generation, hasn't achieved that status and is still climbing to the top 36 years after its release. The Godfather is a masterpiece for many of the same reasons I listed for Lawrence of Arabia, and its dark cinematography and reflective dialogue give us a riveting glimpse into a world gone mad. Is the Dark Knight the same kind of seminal work? Stripping away most of the silliness of comic book style movies, keeping only the unfathomably useful gadgets of the Batman, and the circus style flashiness of the villains, The Joker and Two Face, The Dark Night explores the tension of a city under siege from the point of view of the main protagonists. Much like The Godfather and Lawrence of Arabia, the Dickensian aspect of the story is largely ignored. Innocent bystanders aren't of interest here (the one exception being a remarkably tense sequence on two passenger ferries trying to leave the city), they are just the money on the table in a life or death poker game between Heath Ledger's manic Joker and Christian Bale's reluctant Batman. The movie is a visual spectacle, but the distinct feature of this 'comic book' movie is its willingness to throw out good and evil as character descriptions, making the film a study in criminal behavior and the moral decisions crime fighters must make for the good of the society as a whole. Harvey Dent, destined to become Two Face, and Bruce Wayne, The Batman, must ask themselves what they are willing to do to stop The Joker, whose terrorist plots threaten to destroy what little innocence the 'good' citizens of Gotham cling to, resulting in Dent and Wayne making questionable moves that don't always gain the support of those around them, as when Batman decides to monitor the cell phone activity of the entire city, The Batman's own interpretation of The Patriot Act.I wondered earlier what makes a person decide on their favourite movie. I suspect a lot of people will now say The Dark Knight, but I think its impact will remain shrouded for at least a decade, when George Bush is long removed from the White House and the days of terrorist hysteria have hopefully subsided in our society. Only then will The Dark Knight's allegorical undertones have a full impact on viewers. For now, I think this film is a masterpiece of noir cinema, potentially a brilliant metaphor for our times.",1
"The sequel we deserved to the Batman we loved and wanted. The action, the effects, the visuals, everything in the movie is absolutely incredible and stunning. For everyone who watched it on cinema and liked it sure this film will be timeless for him. It's really one of the greatest comic book movies we ever seen in cinema and heath ledger as joker was a strong acting. In memory of heath ledger.",1
"Ever wondered why this movie has such high ratings? Well, here's why.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors ever and this movie is an example of why he is so good at what he does. The way these characters interact with each other and how good the actors portrayed them is amazing. The joker is really the insane madman that he should be. Batman is the vigilante he is supposed to be. Harvey Dent is the hero turned villain that he should be. This movie doesn't feel like you're watching a movie, it's a cinematic experience. You really feel like you are Bruce Wayne, a millionaire who's trying to make his city a better place. There are really no flaws this movie has that I could think of from the top of my head. It's written perfectly and it basically never gets boring.This movie is a cinematic masterpiece and an example of how to write a movie, act in a movie and direct a movie. Absolutely amazing.",1
"This has to be for me one of the biggest load of monkey crap i have ever seen.i was bored throughout the whole movie.The best part was when the credits rolled.I enjoy movies like time cop and total recall etc,but i really couldn't enjoy this no matter how much i tried to.I don't know how this got an 8/10 rating to be honest.If you are bored and have nothing else to do,you will just be even more bored watching this.I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio in movies like Titanic,Catch me if you can,The Beach etc.But this is one of his worst for me personally.I have now wasted two and half hours of my life, which i will never get back.Watching this movie makes me think comeback Steven Seagal all is forgiven.I think i need to lie down after having watched this awful film.I love films and have watched a lot over the years.And sometimes if i like them i will watch them again,This i definitely wont be watching again.I don't drink,but this movie would drive you to it.",1
"This isn't simply a film, it is a work of art, beautifully crafted, that you learn to appreciate even more after looking under the surface.",1
"I bought the Soundtrack and The special edition DVD of fight club... doesn't say that enough? Not only the Dust Brothers makes the movie a piece of art also Brad Pitt and Edward Norton makes this movie unbelievable cool. The Story, Tyler Durden, Action and the very good acting from both Stars makes this movie along with The Matrix the best movie of 1999. I Think that this movies are the best of all but that is just my opinion. David Fincher, the director of Fight Club did a very good job on the special effects because you don't really know when it is a special effect. Only when the camera moves in a position when it is really unable to do (just trough the streets or in a recycle bin you know it is a special effect. Fight Club rullez!",1
"Christopher Nolan's followup on Batman Begins delivers.This time around, Nolan raises the stakes and provides more energy more tension and a lot more flare. Aside from The Avengers, The Dark Knight is a film that I had eagerly anticipated and also had unfairly high expectations, all thanks to the easter egg scene at the end of Batman Begins. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne and he does a commendable job. He again masks his real persona to the public and he longs to be with Rachel Dawes and sees Harvey Dent as a suitable replacement when Gotham no longer needs a hero who wears a mask. This time around Bruce Wayne is under more pressure and he faces his toughest challenge yet as Batman as he is put into impossible situations by his foes. The supporting cast brings the best of their abilities. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers her lines a little more effectively than Katie Holmes did. It's a shame for Holmes, a bad career move to not star in this, as I didn't completely dislike her in the first film. Michael Cain also provides an excellent supporting role as Alfred, again supporting Bruce in his crusade on crime. Morgan Freeman again provides the film's humor and brings in some levity to this dark film. Gary Oldman again is sharp as Commissioner Gordon, helping Batman on his war against crime. Eric Roberts also has a meaty role as mob boss Sal Maroni. Things always get worse before they get better in Gotham. So with that in mind, lets talk about the villains. I mentioned before that Liam Neeson's Ra's al Ghul is overlooked, I think Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is the second most overlooked villain. Eckhart's arc in the film is beautifully handled and Nolan does a nice job showcasing his corruption and downfall. Harvey Dent is Gotham's ""White Knight,"" their savior. Working with the Batman and Gordon, they cleaned up the streets quite well, but to see all that mean nothing as soon as he becomes Two-Face is just depressing, and when he is Two-Face, he is truly menacing. A tragedy indeed.Speaking of tragedy, it's a shame that Ledger died before the film's release. This is Heath's movie. His Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actor is rightfully given. His win is also not just a pity win out of his death, but because he really outshine all the other nominees that year. Right off the bat Ledger steals the film in the opening scene. I did not see Heath Ledger in this film, but only the Joker. He completely disappears in the role and it's just a thrill to watch on screen. Nolan and Ledger's take on Batman's arch-nemisis is full of complex layers. The Joker's stance on chaos, anarchy, order, and mortality of an ordinary human being makes it psychologically interesting. He has no order, he is all about chaos, he doesn't care about money, as a matter of fact he has no typical criminal motive, all he wants is to watch the world burn. Ultimately, in this film the Joker has a point and that is scary, something uncommon from a villain in most comic-book films. Nolan does a great job of balancing Joker and Two-Face very well. One would think Two-Face would not get enough lime light, but he does, so credit to him and his team of writers. This time around Nolan and his cinematographer Wally Pfister do a better job showcasing the fight choreography. Now one can finally see Batman show off his martial arts expertise. Nolan again shows that Batman is more than a fighter, but also a detective and he's got more arsenal in his hands. The action sequences are a lot more action-packed and paced extremely well. Each action set piece will have you tensed up. I remember I was literally gripping onto my seat as I watched it the first time in theaters. I only had two gripes about the film. One of them is Bale's Batman voice, which is common among many. To be honest, I really liked his Batman voice in Batman Begins. It was intimidating and I would imagine that it'd actually scare someone. But here, I mean, did Bale not watch his own performance in Batman Begins? I've gotten used to it now, but I recall it bothered me the first couple times. Speaking of Batman, even though Ledger's performance is brilliant, this film is essentially very Joker focused. I feel as though Batman gets the short end of the stick. Even the Harvey Dent/Two-Face subplot feels more coherent and apparent than Bruce Wayne's arc. I think I was definitely spoiled by Batman Begins, for my taste I think the film could use a little more Batman in the film. Nevertheless The Dark Knight is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking. It's very Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Pt. II like. This movie is seemed like an impossible task, but a group of extremely talented people managed to make this film work. The pacing is brisk and it doesn't even feel like two and a half hours. There are tons of suspense as Nolan keeps you on the edge, just when you think the story will end up in one particular way, it does a 360 and completely throws you off on multiple occasions. You'll wonder how it'll all play out by the end of the film. The Dark Knight is a landmark achievement. It is a film where it showed many general movie going audience that the superhero genre is capable of being much more. Deep, complex, exciting and a rich viewing experience, The Dark Knight is definitely a film that deserves it's merits and rightfully deserves to be in the top five discussions of the best comic-book adapted superhero epic. 9.5/10",1
"I liked this movie, so inspiring
many quotes I've written from it",1
"This movie is perfection.From the beginning until the very end, this movie grips you and the entire audience completely. It is honestly a crime that certain people think this is a bad movie. There is not one bad part in the entire thing.I saw it 3 days ago and I am still mesmerized by it. People should be regarding this work as one of the rarest forms of art we have left, because beyond just the movie itself, the fact that it was able to be made the way it was is an incredible feat in itself. It is nearly impossible to see a studio these days give a director free reign on the entire movie and script when the film costs as much as it does to make. We have the honor and the privilege as an audience to be able to watch one of the most creative stories come to life in the most fantastical way that it epitomizes why humans go to the movies.This film is brilliant and in no way should be discarded by any means because it is considered a ""summer blockbuster."" This is the rarest summer blockbuster you will ever see and for that matter the rarest and most incredible movie I have seen in at least the past 5 years.",1

Fight Club tells the story of an insomniac insurance investigator (Ed Norton) who initially attends help/support groups to try to help his insomnia.  Annoyed at the presence of another `faker' (Marla ? Helena Bonham Carter) at these groups ? he turns to Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt) ? an eccentric soap salesman.  They soon develop underground `fight clubs' ? a highly aggressive male `support' group.  Fight Club starts to get out of hand when Tyler gears `Project Mayhem' up a notch.The plot of Fight Club is based on a Chuck Palahnuk novel of the same name (brilliant author ? check him out!).  The narrator (Norton) provides classic nihilistic / disinfected / insomniac views of the mundane of life (so many classic lines).The performances are just so good ? Brad Pitt is always a winner in these `sorts' of crazy roles (see 12 Monkeys).  Ed Norton plays a terrific `straight' worker type who is enticed by Tyler's ways and `free' lifestyle ? but as he works out Tyler's world ? Ed Norton is great as the seemingly insane narrator.The soundtrack (by the Dust Brothers) complements the mind-blowing visuals from David Fincher and crew.This is one movie that is a bit of a mind-fudge the first time around ? and a bit of a must for repeat viewing!10 out of 10!!!,1
"The Dark Knight is an amazing action packed thrill ride movie of the year. I have seen all of the Batman movies and I only enjoyed the original movie Batman, Batman Returns, and Batman Begins. But everything changed once I'd seen the best Batman movie since the first, The Dark Knight. Everything about this movie is unbelievable. The plot line was impressive, the filming is incredible, the acting is amazing, and I recommend this movie for an Oscar nomination. The character who should definitely be nominated for an award is Heath Ledger for his outstanding performance as the Joker. I've enjoyed watching Jack Nicholson play his role as the Joker, but I have to say that Heath Ledger is the best Joker of all time. The role for the Joker is supposed to be funny and psychotic and that is exactly what Heath Ledger portrayed for his character. His character was hilarious, psychotic, frightening, and amazing. To be honest, he scared the heck out of me, only a little. I loved this movie completely. I desperately hope this movie is nominated for an Oscar and wins under the category as ""Best movie of the year!"" I dedicate my nomination to Heath Ledger for his amazing performance and I will miss him forever. R.I.P. Heath.",1
"I bought the novel and 24 hours later, it was finished. I read the first chapter five times before moving on. With David Fincher directing this dark and bizarre tale, and Ed Norton and Brad Pitt in their respective roles of the Narrator and Tyler Durden, there is no way this movie cannot completely rock. To keep with the rules, I won't talk about Fight Club any more....",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is so much more then just a ""prison movie"". Indeed a majority of the film takes place in the drab, cold, depressing world of a prison which sets the tone and the stage for the vibrant characters Frank Darabont directs on screen. This is where the movie shines. It's about hope, loyalty, survival and most importantly, friendship. Andy Defresne and Red (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) put on a spectacle in this film, the way they present their characters, the yin and yang of the two is one of the most incredible acting duo's put on celluloid. The film begins with Andy being the one that needs Red, yet in the final act of the film, we see just how much the two need each other. The supporting cast is also brilliant. One of the late, great James Whitmores final great films. I simply cannot do this film justice with words. It's one of those films that needs to be seen at least once. One of the great travesty's is that this film did not win best picture in 1995 or any of the other awards it was nominated for. Not to take away from Forrest Gump, but the Shawshank Redemption simply blew it out of the water.",1
"Fight Club is a supreme movie, but you should be forewarned that it does not necessarily retain the same mood throughout the film.  It starts out as a fun, sexy movie.  You have Edward Norton, playing the quirky narrator we all can sympathize with, paranoid but practical.  Then there's Brad Pitt, playing the ultra smooth, yet offbeat Tyler Derden, who keeps us guessing in every scene.  And of course, the girl- Helena Bonham Carter excellently portrays Marla Singer, a woman with sincere issues, but a soft side as well. If you came to see Brad Pitt, or if you came to see a flashy typical Hollywood blockbuster, the beginning of the movie is the part you'll like. However, as the plot thickens, the movie takes an entirely different shape. Fight Club and Project Mayhem are surrounded by cleverly written, deeply thought out themes and philosophies.  A statement about consumerism, the role of men in a maternal society, and humanity in general is brilliantly made.  However, this is not without a large dose of strangeness, and a plethora of disturbing imagery definitely not recommended for those who came just to see Brad Pitt strut his stuff.  This is where the true writing genius shines through, and where the movie gets (I believe) it's large fan base. Finally, we get to the infamous twist, and surrounding mayhem leading up to and coming down from it.  Both Norton and Pitt do some of their best acting here, and as the narrator's world becomes severely distorted, some of the most poignant observations are made.  Both actors are incredibly true to their characters, and Carter makes an excellent final appearance as well. In short, this movie does many things at once.  It creates a world beyond the imaginations of most, puts out a compelling social statement, and delves into the lives of very complex characters; while at the same time putting up an excellent cast and wonderful production work.  Though not for the feint of heart, and laced with some inherent problems and loose ends, I highly recommend this movie.",1
"Wow this movie is awesome, brilliant villain, story, themes, action and performances, too bad the dark knight rises kinda sucked",1
"Well I wanted a Frank Miller style movie and I got one. Just got back from the Montpelier VT hosted premiere, presented by Senator Leahy and WB CEO Barry Meyer....Heath's haunting portrayal as the Joker was captivating; this is the wild, anarchist, and truly disturbed loon we've been waiting for. I'm glad they kept any concrete origin out and instead opted for explaining Joker's existence as a necessity to Gotham's order and control. From the Killing Joke' ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"" He wails on Bats in one scene with cane and knife, using the strength of a madman, contrasting sharply with Batman showing restraint just when you really think he might lose it.The development of Two-Face played out well, showing his transition from strong public leader Dent to the duality driven, obsessive Two-Face, raging against free will. I'm proud to report he didn't rob the 2nd Gotham Bank at 2pm on the 2nd of February.Batman/Bruce give us what we expect from where Batman Begins leaves him; as a very very busy vigilante. It is nice how little change he goes through as Bruce, against how detached he must become, and how far he must fall as the Batman.Other than that, cool gadgetry from Wayne R&D of course, almost all of it believable. Sonic suit, cell phone hacking- a glimpse of ORACLE? wait till you see the bat-bike show up --- (eruption of cheers)Hardly any confusing effects, stunts or fights. Well choreographed and executed.",1
"Firstly, let me stress that this is a great movie, enjoyable, exciting, interesting; great acting and story. But that is comparing it to general movie standards, I didn't expect a great movie, I expected a sequel to Batman Begins. This review is based on the quality of Batman Begins.The film lacked in many areas, I felt like they replaced all the bad things from Batman Begins, but also the good things!Firstly, one of the best things about Batman Begins was the stress on batman as a symbol feared, using the darkness and shadows to his advantage, in this one he just turns up, one second he's on the ground, camera changes and bang he's knocking someone down... riiight...Secondly, the focus should have been on Batman like the first one (in my opinion), taken from his point of view, however most the film we were following Harvey Dent or the Joker (who was played excellently as many have said, makes it sad we won't see another Ledger performance :(), this made the film seem a lot less like a Batman film, more like a film about something else he just shows up now and then.I think TwoFace's transition to evil was really unbelievable, I think they should have saved him for the next film, showing him in the last shot before the credits role in. However his character was killed just as fast as it was introduced. Joker was more then enough bad guy for the film, he was unnecessary. His end caused a huge anti climax. Lastly, I think a lot of the film felt like it was patched together... For example how Two-Face kidnapped Harvey Dent and Rachel was pretty ridiculous, so the cops figure ""oh we caught Joker, one cop escort should be enough... even though we have mentioned repeatedly many different criminals, politicians etc will be after Harvey Dent"". Just seemed very unbelievable and generally not thought through. How the Joker escaped, so whose idea was it to leave just 1 policeman in the room with him whilst he's untied, with no additional police watching. Wouldn't the ""bomb"" on the ""fat guy"" be noticed when they were searched, etc etc. To much was just not thought through (or at least it felt that way).All in all, as a film it was really great, and I did enjoy it thoroughly, I wish it had been 10 hours long! But as a sequel to Batman Begins I was really disappointed.",1
"Inception is a slow starter. In the beginning it seems like the movie is going to mess with your mind & that's exactly what it does . Starting off slow , It really transforms into a stay calm thriller adventure. Trust me you won't want to miss a second.
Chris Nolan has surely not let his name down. Must watch !",1
This movie was great mostly villan is awosone Kristen Bell also awesome this was a great Christofer Nolan movie.,1
"I like Christopher Nolan's works. Till date, of what I have seen _ Memento, The Prestige, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, he has dished out fabulous films. I would agree to the accepted notion that he is the one who is capable of handling complex themes, especially the ones with deal with mind, the conscious and the subconscious. So when I stepped into watch 'Inception' I was all ready for a complex theme. But of course there was a fear of not able to grasp or understand what is being narrated.Its been long since I have watched such an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Its complex, yes, but keeps you enthralled and entertained. Nolan's greatness is evident when he realizes the complex theme on the screen and makes the film goer understand the concept. Its a huge challenge and he has accomplished it. It takes time to get the grip of what is happening, but once you are into it, its a great watch. Parallels will be drawn with the 'Matrix' series, which also shares a similar theme, of a world away from this 'Real' world. But here its not a world, but 'Dreams'. And not just one, but dreams inside dreams inside dreams inside?Its complex and interesting to watch, so I wont divulge much details here. Full credit to Leonardo DiCaprio for his fabulous portrayal of 'Dom Cobb'.If you are game for a thriller, good action, wonderful effects and above all an intelligent film, go watch INCEPTION !!",1
"Best of all. i love this movie cuz this movie is near to real life , and if we wish something harder we can do everything. RESPECT",1
"With the immense hype surrounding the film primarily due to the pre-mature death of Heath Ledger (playing Joker), the (critical) success of Batman: The Beginning and also the extravagant amount of money spent on effective marketing, the movie The Dark Knight had become one of the most anticipated movies ever to hit the big screen. The last movie to garner such hoopla before its release was SpiderMan -3 and that movie proved to be a disappointment. With higher expectations, I went to watch the Dark Knight and was still totally bowled over by the sheer magnificence of this Chris Nolan Flick.First Day First Show, the Midnight show it was. Due to a technical glitch in the AMC theatres that we went to, the movie did not commence until about 15 minutes past the scheduled start. And when it finally did, there was a huge roar from an obvious houseful crowd that showed up. This is not your typical superhero movie loaded with a great deal of sci-fi action scenes packaged with an abnormal amount of cheesy comedic moments but rather an intense crime thriller that keeps you seat bound for its entire length of over two and a half hours. The film starts a fast pace with the Joker's character introduced in the first couple of scenes itself and maintains that tempo throughout the movie. The basic story line is very simple as it goes like this ? An initially successful effort by District Attorney Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon and Batman to fight crime in Gotham city is thwarted by mastermind psychotic criminal The Joker, as he goes on spreading chaos in utter rampancy. Now it is up to the BatMan, who is himself accused by the mass and the media of being a crooked vigilante, to rescue Gotham city from The Joker's menace.The movie is Super-made in most aspects. Most of the primary characters are very well developed, specially the characters of Batman, the Joker and Harvey Dent. Forget Bruce Wayne, even Batman is seen to be not perfect and his inconsistent set of emotions are aptly visualized by the film-maker. I have not seen the old ones but Christian Bale certainly performs his role as the Batman light years better than predecessors George Clooney and Van Kilmer. However, they could have done better with his voice which although intentionally deep and hoarse made me laugh at times (which the filmmaker probably did not intend to). Aaron Eckhart enacts his role as Harvey Dent exquisitely in the first half of the movie as he is tagged as the ""Real hero of Gotham City"". He takes complete advantage of the huge screen time that he gets. He does not have much to offer as 2Face though. Gary Oldman, Maggie, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all do justice to their characters as Lt. Gordon, Rachael, Alfred and Lucius. Well, we could go on and on about the other things in the movie like great action, special effects, immaculate dialogues and the breath-taking chase scene but the real show stealer is the character of Joker. Heath Ledger's enacting the Joker is probably and arguably one of most (if not THE most) splendid performance in big Screen. He deserves an Oscar for this role and does more than just justice to a role that the Nolan's might have only envisioned. Heath Ledger's untimely death might have (probably is) been the prime reason that brought people in flocks into the theaters allover US in its opening weekend but it is the Joker (Ledger's performance) that will see through and place ""The Dark Knight"" alongside Shrek 2 and Titanic as one of the Highest Grossing movies of All-time.",1
"Still awesome, best thing about this movie is how watching it now thinking, wow kids now-a-days are so pathetic, they would probably boycott it!",1
This role and artist poll is brilliant. My vote for director and joker heath ledger. I think best word on film joker: i like same dog because it is fallow car if catch it doesn't know what it do... lets come batman mean Christian Bale this man work hard and two people in same man. if be night he is fighter warrior dark knight but not hero if be light on day he is jerk of world. i think difficult role does mean need hard work attention and learning. if love this man this is right cohoice for film. and i like favorite actor and human role be alfred is Michael Caine show cute and nice man. last word is Liam Neeson as ducard he is best fighter ever seen,1
"I had heard from several people that I should see Fight Club before I reluctantly rented it (I've never been terribly impressed with David Fincher's work).  After having finally watched it, I have no idea what they were thinking.  Stylistically it was nothing special--for some reason people are impressed by that yellowish tint Fincher seems to love (as seen in The Game).  This doesn't do anything special in my opinion--all it signifies to me is that the director wears yellow tinted sunglasses a bit too often. Some of the cinematography was fairly intricate, but nothing that added up to ""brilliant"" in any way (as many other reviewers seem to think).  I'm sure it's not difficult to get good looking shots on a budget of $63 million. In terms of content, Fincher really says nothing of consequence.  Who is he to comment on the working class?  Does he really find humor in people suffering from cancer?  He shows such a bleak, inaccurate view of the life that most people in this country lead and I really don't see the point--is Fincher trying to say that anyone who works 9-5 in order to make a nice home and to support themselves/their families is misguided?  Is it hard to see that people are much more complex than any of the characters in this movie? In order to ""really live"", should we all pour acid on our hands, crash our cars, and beat each other into a bloody pulp?  Does Fincher think he's making an intelligent political statement?  This lack of insight can be expected from someone whose toughest decision is figuring out which luxury car he feels like driving to the studio in the morning.  The only people I can imagine this movie would appeal to are male teenagers/college students with maxed out credit cards who think they know something about film because they've seen Reservoir Dogs.  I'm not going to give away the movie, but as many others have noted it has a trick ending that changes the meaning of the rest of the story.  This is not unlike what Fincher did in The Game. Personally I find this to be a cheap tactic used in order to get people to see the movie a second time (i.e. The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects), and doesn't make for art or even intelligent entertainment.  Fincher should stick to movies like The Game which, while not really that good, don't pretend to be much more than they are--cheap entertainment.  I normally don't care at all when a bad film or lousy director make it big--it happens all the time--but it's unbelievable to me that so many people comment on the artistic value of this movie.  I'm not really going to complain about the placement of it on the imdb top 250 (because it doesn't matter and there are even worse movies high up on the list), but just take a look at some of the films below this one.  There are so many great things to see out there--don't waste your time on this",1
"this is a kind of movie made in decades.. chris nolan did an outstanding job making it a milestone in world cinema..this is a movie that goes with you in your mind everywhere..' great visual effects,amazing cinematography and majestic acting with an unimaginable concept hit deep to your mind. and not allow to see other than the screen and not allow to think anything else..leonardo ""the great"" caprio showed his life's most phenomenal acting, a step ahead what he has done in aviator and shutter island.his eyes talk..expressions make everything clear without words.such an eminent actor who live the role he brought in.....the ace in the hole is the story..its concept of dream..it is really a mind twister..cinematography juxtaposes the real and the surreal with such finesse, you never do get confused and always remain aware of the slippery ground you are treading on.emotional aspects in this movie make it appealing .. usually movies of this genre leave nothing for emotions but inception showed emotions as its powerful part.. a new fresh form..so are you ready to dream on..........",1
"My personal all time favorite movie.Everything about this movie is so perfect. The acting, the plotline, the idea behind the plot, the action, the emotion, the adrenaline, the soundtrack, the look. Such a beautifully well crafted movie that I keep understanding new things each time I rewatch it. I personally am more of an action kind of movie-watcher so keep that bias in mind.
The movie admittedly is difficult to understand the first time you watch it, but is still quite enjoyable. But I love how the movie gets more enjoyable as you rewatch it. There are so many movies that I'm like ""eh, watched it, solid, wouldn't really care to watch again"" but this movie isn't made up of the ""movie junk food"" that's in most movies.",1
"The Dark Knight is a good film. All-the-way-around, it keeps the audience interested and is highly entertaining, decently thought-provoking, and very impressive from a technical standpoint.The special effects are above average, although parts of it are a little below par and don't fit as seamlessly as we'd all like. The acting does not disappoint; as this film does not rely on the actors much, I have no complaints. Heath Ledger does a convincing job as the Joker, bringing new depth to the character--largely belittling the former Jack Nicholson Joker--however Heath's performance has likewise been moderately overrated. The plot is well-developed, above average for modern action flicks.In many ways I believe it surpasses Batman Begins, and because of it the series still tops the comic-book adaptations. Tonally, it is the expected sequel. It is somewhat darker, but it continues Nolan's refreshing take on the Batman series. And with this latest addition, it makes all the other Batman films even more forgettable.However, to say that The Dark Knight is the best film ever overlooks many other great films. Realistically, I would put it on the level of Jurassic Park, giving The Dark Knight a slight edge, but both deserving a spot among the top films in modern cinema.",1
"Perhaps everyone hides another self inside, the superficial self is diligent in the work, pursues the quality of life enhancement, caters to the request of this world; the other oneself rebellious, unceasingly revolts, loses everything lacks obtains the freedom. It ended well.",1
"This movie was amazing. Never take your eyes off of the screen ever while watching this. If you do, you will miss important details that are required in order to understand it. This movie overall was amazing and couldn't be better. I cannot say anything about this movie other than that, for it will contain spoilers and I am not that kind of person. What I will say though, is that the performances are outstanding. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter all do fantastic in this movie and it would be a sin to not acknowledge that. The overall story is fantastic as well. The twists and turns this movie takes you is unparalleled to anything I have seen in a long while. You are doing yourself a disservice if you do not watch this movie, for it is fantastic and it could not be better.",1
"Not just a superhero movie, just a piece of art. Must see!!",1
"Batman in The Dark Knight is crafted the best in its own journey to earning the title of ""The Dark Knight"".",1
"A truly rare, intelligent summer blockbuster packed with ideas and concepts to keep the audience contemplating long after the credits. Inception succeeds on multiple levels thanks to it's brilliant script, wonderful direction and outstanding effects - all of which come together to create a unique, surreal experience unseen in mainstream blockbuster entertainment.Mitchell Bulfin",1
"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.",1
"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison,but ""The Shawshank Redemption "" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicariousexperiences and quick, superficial emotions.""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice toinclude us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime,based on friendship and hope.",1
"My fav movie ever, I watch it more than 10 times !!!!",1
"This movie reminds me of 'The Matrix' which is one of my favorite films of all time. I like Sci-Fi and I like action as much as philosophy. So when you mix all these ingredients together it becomes a really heady experience which feels great for a nerd like me. It is intellectually stimulating and entertaining at the same time. But there is one thing you should know before watching this film - that there is no surprise ending. I had this notion after watching 10 min of the film and that spoiled the ending for me. Blame it on 'Shutter Island' but anyway Nolan steers clear of any cliché in this regard. I wish I could enlist Cobb (Leo Di Caprio) to extract some good ideas from Nolan's mind or better still if Nolan could be good enough to send Cobb to 'incept' my mind with positive ideas. Anyway, the film is a great idea in itself as it deals with common experiences that affect everybody like DREAMS, REALITY, MEMORIES (Real, Imagined & suppressed), IMAGINATION & IDEA itself. How Nolan weaves all these concepts into an entertaining story is what this movie is all about.I think Christopher Nolan is the director of this decade. He has given some of the most wonderful movies in the recent past. Prestige, Memento, Batman series and now Inception. It is already in the top five list in IMDb. Don't miss it.",1
"If you are looking for entertainment and mind boggling at the same time, this is the perfect one for that matter. This movie takes you to a totally different level. The story and direction are just so amazing that you can't predict this movie until you are very great at predicting.You cannot tell a specific genre for this movie. It is a thriller, funny, action, drama, mind boggling, you name it you have it. The performance of the cast is brilliant and the combination of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton is a great success.I have to admit that this is the best movie ever and you cannot stay without watching it. If you are a fan of either brad or Edward, you cannot miss it.",1
"Since I saw this movie I can't stop trying to figure out my dreams.A fantastic way to present this story to the viewer, with a luxurious cast.",1
"Inception has the capacity to blow you away.Just like the classics of decades gone by,namely The Godfather movies and movies by the likes of Scorcese and Scott, this movie is the classic of our generation and Nolan truly deserves his place among the elite.The movie has a scintillating pace throughout and the premise despite being far-fetched has a believable quality to it thanks to some amazing performances and intelligent direction.The viewer is immediately thrown into Nolan's world of corporate espionage and extraction of ""ideas"".The editing is magnificent as the audience is often subjected to following multiple narratives without losing connection with the plot.There is a lot of craft involved in revealing just about enough at just the right time to keep you on the edge.Once the movie pushes into the triple-dream-layer sequence one cannot help but gape in astonishment at how mind boggling special-effects are seamlessly combined with the intricacies of the plot.The climax,quite simply, takes your breath away just like the climaxes of earlier Nolan films like ""Following"" and ""The Dark Knight"".The performances are commendable and one wonders how Nolan always seems to get his casting perfectly apt.Leonardo DiCaprio has evolved so much from the days of ""Titanic"".His role,though similar to the one he played in ""Shutter Island"", evokes sympathy for the man whose inner guilt poses the greatest hazard to the mission.Its a balanced performance and his scenes with Marion Cotillard are terrific.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a pleasant surprise turning in a very neat job with his portrayal of Arthur.Ken Watanabe is quite classy and exudes panache throughout.Tom Hardy and Ellen Page play their parts well.But the one to look out for is Cillian Murphy.In his role of an heir to a billionaire oil tycoon,he excels in bringing out the torment and angst associated with living in the shadow of his father.Michael Caine though, is a bit underused and one always yearns to see more of him.Hanz Zimmer has once again emerged with a winning score which completely takes over the movie in the final few minutes and pushes the climax a few notches higher.The undertone is a tad similar to the one used in ""Shutter Island"" but one enjoys the ominous music as it lends a certain gravity to the overall mood.All in all, if you watch it once,you will watch it again.And then again.And again.Because each viewing offers something new.Something extra.When I saw ""The Dark Knight"", I said to myself that Nolan has truly reached his pinnacle and that this here is his masterpiece.Its a pity that I did not check my totem then.I must have been dreaming!",1
"This movie has it all... action, romance, drama. I love a movie with multiple genres thrown into it. Get action by all its performers. It was great to go to the IMAX and see all the action scenes actually in IMAX covering the whole screen. It made me feel like I was in the movie. There are a few complaints I had with it. First was it seemed really long, second was that Two Face/Harvey Dent died. I mean Two-Face was one of the best bad guys apart from the Joker and the Riddler. Third was that they replaced Katie Holmes in it. True she may not be the best actress but I don't like it when they replace a actor in a movie for example, Racheal Weisz in The Mummy movies. and finally fourth, I wish we saw more of the Scarecrow. Other than those four things I loved the movie.",1
"Christopher Nolan strikes a balance of straight-forward entertainment, with lots of action, fun character dynamics, and awe-striking special effects, and complex story-telling that help embellish the sentiment behind the story. This is Christopher Nolan at his best. Not his most original work (that might be ""Memento"") and not his most commercial success (that's ""The Dark Knight""), but rather a piece that stands on its own as a true auteur work of art and a summer blockbuster that must audiences will like if not love.""Inception"" is a science-fiction heist that reunites a great ensemble that bring a unique personality to each of their characters, without any of them feeling one-dimensional. Yet it all revolves around it's main character, played wonderfully by Leonardo DiCaprio, who struggles with his own demons as he tries to orchestrate this dream caper. It is his story that provides the emotional core of the film, one of obsession and longing, that ultimately leads to a satisfying finale beautifully complemented by Hans Zimmer's often-imitated score.It has plenty of twists, fights, many special and visual effects, and subtle humor to keep your average movie goer entertained, but the beauty of the film goes way beyond that to have a very compelling cinematography, intricate story-telling, and genuine attention to detail that calls for multiple viewings, each making the film better than before.It's bound to become a classic.",1
"""Inception"" works for the viewer, in a way, like the world itself worked for Leonard, the hero of ""Memento."" We are always in the Now. We have made some notes while getting Here, but we are not quite sure where Here is. Yet matters of life, death and the heart are involved--oh, and those multi-national corporations, of course. And Nolan doesn't pause before using well-crafted scenes from spycraft or espionage, including a clever scheme on board a 747 (even explaining why it must be a 747).The movies often seem to come from the recycling bin these days: Sequels, remakes, franchises. ""Inception"" does a difficult thing. It is wholly original, cut from new cloth, and yet structured with action movie basics so it feels like it makes more sense than (quite possibly) it does. I thought there was a hole in ""Memento:"" How does a man with short-term memory loss remember he has short-term memory loss? Maybe there's a hole in ""Inception"" too, but I can't find it. Christopher Nolan reinvented ""Batman."" This time he isn't reinventing anything. Yet few directors will attempt to recycle ""Inception."" I think when Nolan left the labyrinth, he threw away the map.",1
One of inspiring movie of all time every one should watch it. times I can understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. Great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies. And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch.,1

This was the best movie ever!! I watched this movie expecting it would be the best and it was. Just watching the previews with Heath Ledger playing the Joker got me hooked. i knew i had to watch this movie. And of course Heath Ledger did a great job. He totally got into his character and nailed it. This was way better than the first and one of my favorites. it was a great action film as it was very psychological and suspenseful. I cant wait until the next batman comes out.This movie was so great that i had to watch it more than once. i wanted to watch it in imax but it was sold out and i couldn't. but i did get to watch it on a pretty big screen.this movie was just really awesome. Everyone nailed their parts. the one thing i didn't like though was when Christian Bale was batman and spoke in that very deep annoying voice. it seemed like he was trying too hard. Overall this was the best movie i have ever seen. or at least one of the best.R.I.P. Heath Ledger,1
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films of all time, and is considered the best drama ever. If you ask the people on the street what is the best movie ever, you will probably hear the name of this film. Although it was built without the expectation of a high box office, it produced a great interest in the whole world, which attracted great attention (this type of film was called sleeper). morgan freeman and tim robbins' best films wouldn't be wrong. The story of two prisoners who met in prison and were close friends. An impressive scenario, flawless acting and a legend. As if you are having the movie you are caught up in the story. so much so that no one could have been touched in the final with no sense of age. Many scenes and dialogs on the internet are still breaking records on the Internet. a film that definitely and strictly needs to be monitored.",1
"this is one of the most incredible movies ever. it is very well done and has a lot of suspense and drama. Morgan freeman is incredible, as always and never stops to amaze. my favorite movie ever. i recommend this movie to everyone. when red doesn't kill himself but instead says that red was here i was so happy. and that whole thing where they meet on the beach at the end is so amazing and i was thrilled. it is perfectly acted and done with exquisite directing. i am so in love with this movie because it is so perfect and incredible. the authenticity is incredible. and how can i write a review without mentioning the greatest twist ever? he escapes and you are like ""what?!""",1
"Inception. Arguably one of the best and highest rated films of 2010. Starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Ellen Page(of Juno fame) and guest starring Cillian Murphy ( Batman begins) amongst others, and directed and written by Christopher ""Dark Knight"" Nolan, Inception had many high expectations.Having seen the film twice I managed to grasp the concept a lot easier second time round( although it has to be said the plot is not as complicated as many people would have make out). Dream within a dream within a dream within a dream. Coupled with the superbly interesting and original concept is the superbly written script and the mind blowing SFX ( which makes Avatar look tame at best) and the great acting from Di Caprio, Gordon-Levitt and many of the supporting cast. I wasn't as keen on Ellen Page, she wasn't bad I just wasn't as keen on her as the other cast.With a great guest star performance from Michael Caine and a superb plot twist which I defy anyone to say they saw coming, I can only hope that this is the start of something new for films. A film that doesn't talk down to the audience, a film that requires a little bit of thought on the viewers part.Overall a superb film with few flaws I can mention with an ending which will leave the viewer gasping for more and sparking millions of debates all over the internet.Having said this, I know how Hollywood has a record for ruining great films with naff sequels, so from me to you Mr Nolan, keep this as a one off. If it ain't broken don't fix it!My overall Rating 10/10",1
This movie is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen! The story is beautifully written and the acting is on point. This movie definitely deserves to be on top of the Top Rated Movies list. If you haven't seen this movie yet I can only recommend you to watch it cause you will have a good time with this movie.,1
"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.",1
"When somebody sees the title ""Fight Club'' for a movie the only things that he will think is blood,fights and violence.But,Fight club is exactly the opposite.It's different way to feel free and forget pressure,your job or whatever makes you feel bad. Fght club is not bad,just too different and crazy to understand it's definition.I that I've seen the movie,would characterize this club as a guy,as ...Tyler, the crazy and cool person that tries to build a new world through this club.A new beginning,a new way to express ourselves and understand the value of life.This is the Fight Club,this is Tyler.The film is a masterpiece and the tremendous acting of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton turn it into one of the best films of all time.But,I think i've said enough.For those who haven't watched the film,stop reading my review,put on your shoes and run fast to rent it.And you better take a bar of soap with you.It will be useful!",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made. Apart from a small number of nitpicks, this film is flawless. If you haven't seen this film, you need to. This film represents how good Hollywood can get and has set the bar very, very high. Not a single frame of film is wasted, every aspect of this film is important, it is just perfect.",1
"""Inception; 2010 release; 148 min.) brings the complex story of Dom Cobb and his cohorts. Cobb works as an industrial spy who ""extracts"" information through a shared dream world into someone's subconsciousness. However, he is now asked to do the exact opposite: rather than extracting an idea, he need to implant and idea, a so-called inception, into a competitor's subconsciousness. If he succeeds, Cobbs, a fugitive from the US (for reasons I will not spoil), will be able to get back to the US and see his kids again...Couple of comments: this opus from writer-producer-director Christopher Nolan celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. I saw the movie when it was released back then but hadn't seen it since. Frankly, I had very little recollection of the detailed plot line, so it really felt like watching this movie for the first time again. I must say that I was bowled over by it all, truly a unique movie experience on so many levels. It reminds us why Christopher Nolan is such an original film maker, if not the LEADING film maker of this current generation. I have loved his work since his 2000 film ""Memento"". ""Inception"" is currently showing in theaters as Inception 10th Anniversary Event"", and opens with a 10-15 min. interview of Nolan and other members of the film making crew (photographer, etc.). Nolan notes among other things (i) how well the film stands up technology-wise after a decade, and (ii) how important the score (by Hans Zimmer) is, and that it truly can only be fully experienced in a theater with ""many big speakers behind the screen"".""Inception 10th Anniversary Event"" opened this past weekend in theaters, essentially as a teaser for the long delayed release of his new film ""Tenet"", which will come out in theaters in the next week or two. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at the Cinemark here in Cincinnati turned out to be a private screening, as I literally had this big theater all to myself. There was a long segment on ""Tenet"" before ""Inception"" started, and I simply cannot wait to see ""Tenet"", which promises to be a cinematic event and experience right up there along with ""Inception"". Meanwhile, if you have't seen ""Inception"" yet or it's been quite a long time, I'd readily suggest you check out ""Inception 10th Anniversary Event"" in a theater near you, and draw your own conclusion.",1
"I know a lot of people talk about classic movies, their favourites and ""Must see movies"" but The Shawshank Redemption has got to be one of the best movies of all timeThere is no better voice over/narrator than Morgan Freeman, but his acting in this is just fantastic as well.This is Tim Robbins best role by far and his acting is on pointThis film is an example of Writing and Pacing, there's no big explosions, or monsters, or aliens, or robots or a pile of big names to make money it's all about the writing and the pacing. I'll keep this completely spoiler free for those who haven't seen it and simply say. ""You need to see this movie""It's an example of subtly and making smart decisions, even though apparently i didn't get great reviews when it first came out, but Shawshank will go down in history as an all time great film and will probably forever be in my top 10 favourite films.Andyt2k",1

Well i was spellbound and shocked at the ending, and then looked after by the director as they completed the film on the beach in Mexico.A truly wonderful film, worthy of not just the Oscar nominations but the all the Oscars themselves.

"""Rule number 1 of Fight Club: You do not talk about Fight Club.""Satirical, entertaining, bold, challenging and heavily stylized. Usually if a film has one of these qualities it is a good accomplishment. But David Fincher' acclaimed Fight Club (1999) has all of them, thereby cementing its status as upcoming cult in cinema. This is an important film that bravely plunges into the exploration of human issues like violence and depression, and that does so with flair and fury. It also sprinkles good doses of humour onto its final product, making Fight Club an enjoyable ride.Edward Norton is a thirty year old office worker, lazily frozen in a comatose state of ordering IKEA furniture and getting hounded by his boss. What takes him and shakes him is the arrival of Tyler Duren (Brad Pitt) who introduces him to a subculture of anarchy and a club called 'Fight Club'.Fight Club is an extremely graphic, violent and blunt portrayal of society and it looks into human nature. While Edward Norton's character as 'The Narrator' is an extreme case study, we all recognise aspects of his life and the thoughts in his head. The only problem as far as I'm concerned are the actors. You can never get away from the 'Pitt factor' in Brad Pitt's performance and it is often distracting. Edward Norton's narration often feels flat and emotionless. This would have been very appropriate in the beginning of the film, but as it progresses and he begins to feel more alive, his lifeless tone drags down the quality.This wouldn't make my top 20, but it'd probably make my top 30 list.8/10",1
"The best superhero movie ever, with a great cast and very well directed.",1
"This is one of my favorite movies. The plot of the story is strange, exciting, and very intriguing. The twist is awesome, shocking, and coincides perfectly with the events of the movie. And in addition to the good action found in the movie it is full of humor. Also plenty of great and funny quotes to make the movie memorable. The ending to the movies also brings the movie full circle and leaves you feeling satisfied.If you want to see a good action and funny movie with an intriguing story line, you should watch this movie. Regardless if you don't its still a must see movie if you have never watched it. Highly recommended.",1
This film has some of the best action and acting I've ever seen. An amazing crime thriller if I've ever seen one. 10/10,1
This movie is one of the best and I think it deserves to be ranked first on the site.,1
"First I want to say that Leonardo DiCaprio is great in this movie. It might not be his best performance, but he still proves to be one of the greatest actors out there today. Inception has a great story that requires thought. Following a group of people that can control their and other people's dreams, Inception has some great acting, deep storytelling (that can be hard to follow sometimes) and an awesome soundtrack for every intense scene. 9/10",1
"Shawshank redemption is one of the greatest movies in the history of movies production ...
This movie has drama suspense Comedy and it aced all these categories
Before talking about this movie we should mention that it wasn't the great movie in the year of its production ...hadn't a great success in cinema because in 1994 there were alot of magnificent movies
But actually this movie is the best and we easily can prove it by looking at the top 10 movies in IMDB and we could easily understand that it's the 1st since I was born
I rated this movie 10 and i was pleased watching it",1
"Great movie! I am so picky in movies and so hard to find good movie nowadays. But The Shawshank Redemption one of the best Movies I've Ever Seen! The Ideas the Actors all in all perfect. They told me about it many years ago, you should watch it and I kept postponed it till one Friday I said I have to spare 2 and half hours to watch then voil_! Glad I've watched it.",1
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!",1
"What if the tunnel was blocked at the end and so he ended up trapped there? I guess he could have crawled backwards and up out the pipe again, but still horrible to think about. This film is so popular because the pipe symbolizes your working life and the beach scene at the end is the escape from working life. Its not about prison, its about the 9 to 5.Everyone wants to do an Andy Dufresne.Also, he'd escaped his marriage and gets to live out his life having fun on the beach playing around a boat with his pal and that is presented as the definition of Paradise, maybe it is, but you know it'd probably get old after a couple of days.",1
"Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.",1
"It's funny to think that 'The Shawshank Redeption' was a complete flop when it first came out, only to now sit at the top of the IMDb 'greatest films of all-time' list. I'm not sure why it wasn't a hit a first because, like virtually everybody else who has watched it, I loved everything about this film and would also consider it to be one of the best films ever made.I can't add much more to the 4,116 reviews that have already been written, but what I will say is that I've never felt so emotionally involved in a film before as I did with this one. I'd heard great things about the 'Shawshank' and that can often lead to disappointment, but in this case my expectations were far exceeded. I have to mention the ending as well, which is just poetic - in my opinion the greatest ending to a film ever.An average rating of 9.3 on IMDb from over 1.6 million votes is truly remarkable, but thoroughly deserved. I can't speak highly enough of 'The Shawshank Redemption', an amazing film that is sure to leave you feeling emotionally overwhelmed.",1
"When I read the statistics about the movie, I was really surprised. This movie had grossed less than 40M! This is very strange. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were amazing in this movie. I believe should have been won something. I really recommend you people to watch this; it is a great movie. Fight Club represents the desperate cry of the consumerist modern man for something to put out the anxiety and conformism of his life. Brad Pitt is hilarious and charismatic, stealing the show every scene he's in. This is a movie that is more than one might think, and at the end you will definitely be thinking a lot and be surprised.",1
"The story....the cinematography...and the actors! And ol the actors are at there best.I saw the film for the very time tonight and while I did enjoy it, I felt it was a bit overrated. There's been so much hype and deconstruction of this film over the last 4 decades, it's hard to approach it with a fresh perspective. Th cinematography was really beautiful and the lighting especially in the indoor scenes really set a glorious mood just wow.",1
"From the director of the 1995 masterpiece 'Se7en' comes a new thriller from acclaimed director David Fincher. His direction is great in both films, but this one stands out as one of the best films of 1999. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are plain awesome, their performances are brilliant. While Pitt and Norton impress, the screenwriter Jim Uhlus, also shows a lot of confidence in script-writing.In all areas, Fight Club excels beyond belief, and I highly recommend it.Rating: 10",1
"1994 was a fantastic year for film. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Forrest Gump"", and ""The Lion King"" are some of my favorite movies of all time. But this one dwarfs all three of them in comparison. The viewer is left thoroughly engaged throughout the entire picture, and there doesn't seem to be a scene that is out of place. The final act is also one of the most satisfying in history. Beautiful performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the supporting cast will leave you hanging on every scene.Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is a former banker who is convicted of murdering his wife and a professional golfer after finding out about her having an affair with him, but Andy is an innocent man. He is given two life sentences to be served at Shawshank Prison, where he meets Red (Freeman), a smuggler who is also serving time for murder. What follows is a twenty year long saga of heartbreak, guilt, remorse, and ultimately, as the title of the film suggests, redemption.The appeal is multi-layered. On a surface level, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" works as a piece of entertainment. The characters are all believable and have depth to them. The vicious prison Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his brutish prison guard captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) are despicable villains who are very easy to root against. The pacing of the storytelling is excellent as well, and like I said earlier, the structuring of the scenes never really takes you out of the experience. This is one of the easiest movies to sit down and just watch.But beyond that, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" also works as a piece of art. A poetic tale of finding one's place in society and within themselves. Some of these things are a bit on the nose, with Brooks (James Whitmore) basically serving as the story's antithesis to Red. On first viewing, one would be mistaken to think that this movie is about Andy and his redemption after being wrongly accused. In actuality, it is Red who is ultimately redeemed through a close friendship with an unorthodox inmate who shows him a brighter and more optimistic side to life. Heck, Red is the one who is narrating and leading us through his life. Anything more would dive into spoiler territory, but I think that it goes to show that this is the kind of movie that can't even be mentioned without the inevitability of discussing deeper themes, character motivations, and visual motifs.This one really deserves its recognition as a pillar of cinema. There isn't a whole lot else to say without sounding redundant and repeating what every other movie critic has said to this point, but if you haven't seen it you definitely owe it to yourself to do so.",1
"This movie is one of the finest movies produced ,the storytelling is really appealing.",1
"The sheer brilliance of this film cannot be described in words. The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most riveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache'. This is a film that never lets go of its momentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movie.Do not treat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story. It has lot more going for it. For instance one of the many ""Aces"" in the movie is the Joker - heath ledger. He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen. The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to come.""The Dark Knight"" is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motives.Batman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in. This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the movie reaches its pinnacle.There are lots of positives one can see within this 2 hour plus epic.In simple words. It is a 10 on 10 and must see.",1
Great movie about an escape from Shawshank prison.,1
"Well actually when I decided to watch it, my expectations of it were really really high because everyone around me had built it up so much. This is a movie of which sub-plots are all over the place with some wishful thinking of the director or the screenwriter. Joker is much too powerful. He's got many, many, many connections that he can even rig hospitals, blow up bridges, even manage truck drivers. If this is a superhero movie, where the hell is our superhero? Superman Returns was junk, too but at least it had a really blasting superhero movie opening. Where is Batman? C. Bale is a brilliant choice for Batman but there is not enough Batman but too much Joker.",1
"I found this film very dark and unsettling. At some moments I thought it was funny in a dark way.The darkness of the film comes mostly from the message the protagonist wants to send to the world. The message is depressing, making this film a skin crawler.For me, Brad Pitt played his character very well. I was afraid of him.After a plot twist the film becomes more steady and tight then before. It becomes very tense due to the impact of the twist, the stellar performances and the sometimes overwhelming use of music.Before the twist the film lacks some pace and progress in the story.",1
"Undoubtedly the best plot twist in a film, when it is revealed that Tyler isn't real it changes how you see the whole film up to that point making me want to rewatch it knowing what I know now. It is such a well throughout plot and the acting is really good too, it's no wonder this film has the reputation it does. Really feel like the main character develops throughout the film, making it feel meaningful. Don't quite get the logistics of how he blew up his apartment or why he wanted to illuminate debt towards the end but this didn't really detract from the film, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention.",1
"Shawshank is a movie I find little to no flaws. It doesn't feel it's runtime at all, impeccably cast, narratively sound, no filler, emotional, an crowdpleaser ending, and narration that actually feels necesarry. Almost every character is fleshed out in a subtle and fitting way that doesn't take you out of the movie, and it doesn't cliche the prison workers. The film takes place over twenty years, giving it stakes and a reason for the emotional connection between characters that would be manufactutred in a week in a lesser movie. The way the prisoners interact with and think of Dufrense grows and develops in a believeable and natural way. A ten/ten emorional rollercoaser that I'll never forget.",1
"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.",1
"This is a movie where the audience needs to see the movie twice to fully grasp the entire plot. In this case, it is definitely not a bad thing. I just got back from the IMAX showing of Inception a second time, fully blown away by visuals that put Avatar to shame.Despite the incredible special effects, it is the sheer complexity of Inception that is the masterpiece.This movie earns a 10/10 for mastering all the genres of movies into one. Action, Suspense, Drama, Comedy, Science Fiction, etc etc etc. I have not met one person who has hated Inception.Nolan at his best so far, and yes this is coming from a Dark Knight fanatic. It only leaves us wishing for more. If this movie does not win Best Picture, I don't know what will.10/10",1
"I believe that I grew up watching one of the best series of Batman made, Batman: The Animated Series. I do not know if everyone would agree with that, but I feel as though that particular stretch of Batman established the criminals and it also established who Batman was. Having seen that series in its entirety, and the Animated movie ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,"" I think I know who Batman should be portrayed as.The Joker was done perfectly, and to every individual who claims that this shouldn't be regarded as the best, you are positively wrong. The animated series and the comic books could only go so far as to illustrating the sheer destruction the Joker is capable of, but where they stopped, Heath Ledger continued. I think that his performance was amazing; I'm not saying this because he died after the filming of the movie, I'm saying this because I know character work. I do improv, I know how difficult it is to maintain and create a completely separate and individual character. Ledger remade The Joker. To not recognize this feat is to be ignorant of fantastic character creation.The Batman was not any better, I will admit. I cannot blame Bale for this, but instead I think the Director should take the blame. Nolan dropped the ball when it came to making the Batman again. There was no spectacular notion of the hard work or diligence that Wayne put into finding and stopping the Joker, instead, it just seemed as though Batman was going along for the wild ride with the Joker. I do not know if this was intended, or if it was the way it worked in previous works of Batman, but I do not think it helped make the Batman as strong as the Joker.Two-Face did a substantial job of distracting and removing the focus away from Joker's destruction in the end. I understood his purpose in the film, but I do not think that he added much. IN fact, I would have liked it more if the audience was left to guess what happened to Two-Face when the Joker talked to him. This could have led to another film with Two-Face as a villain, etc, etc. This is not the point, Two-Face was slightly obnoxious in the end because he stole away from the real battle.Overall, I feel as though this film was great. There were indeed some annoyances with the direction and the placement of philosophical sentiments in dialogue, but nonetheless, it was a fantastic ride.""Does anybody want to see a magic trick?...HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!""",1
"Christopher Nolan will surely be crowned the god of film making with this one. This movie is perfect in all areas of film making the writing, the direction, the acting, the cinematography. You will want to watch it again once you have watched it. Chris Nolan wrote the script so intelligently without any loop holes ( at I didn't find any) and then presented it on screen in his own mind teasing way. The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy is simply flawless. The BGM by Hans Zimmer makes you lose yourself and immerse yourself into the movie.And folks this is not a copy of the Japanese animated movie paprika. It is not a copy of paprika at any level at all. But if you want to argue that the whole concept of going into other people's dreams has been stolen from paprika then you are mistaken. The concept of going into other people's dreams has already been used in a 1984 Dennis Quaid movie called Dreamscape. So eff off and watch the movie and lose yourself in this Christopher Nolan masterpiece. Can't wait for the blu ray to come out but of course I can't stop myself from going to the cinema hall watching it as many times as possible. As the blu ray will take a long time to come out.",1
"OK so when a movie is surrounded with so much hype it's usually impossible to live up to the high expectations and not to disappoint the fans and moviegoers expecting the best movie of the year.But this movie is an exception - it is indeed the greatest Batman movie ever and the 2nd best comic book movie behind only Sin City.This is quality film-making at its best.Chris Nolan is just an amazing director and what he did with the source material is phenomenal.He manages to top his 2005 Batman Begins and create an even more mature and exciting movie which explores the dark side of every one of us,our inner side which we try to hide but are sometimes provoked to show.Nolan shows us a dark side of life and further explores it.You can tell that he did his homework and was inspired by great Batman comic stories such as The Dark Knight Returns,The Long Halloween and many more.The movie absolutely rises above its comic book boundary and is a unique achievement on its own creating a real earthy superhero who is actually human as much as each of us.The performances are all flawless to say the least.Our hero Christian Bale is a terrific Batman/Bruce Wayne who feels and knows that he has much responsibility on his shoulders and he's the one destined to fight crime but sometimes finds it hard to resist to the temptation of being a villain himself,to break the rules he had sworn to keep.The supporting actors all add depth to the movie.Michael Cane is good as Alfred although is still prefer Michael Gough as the butler,Gary Oldman is the perfect commissioner Gordon and looks and feels exactly like his comic archetype,Maggie Gyllenhaal is a much better Rachel than Katy Holmes and is anything but annoying.Now for me the best thing about the movie - the villains.Everything about Heath Ledger's masterful turn into Joker has already been said so I don't know what else to add except that he's a perfect Joker who feels exactly like Frank Miller's take on the villain.Jack Nicholson's take on the Joker was very different from Heath's so I think there shouldn't be any comparison between the two but I think we can all agree that they are both awesome.However what truly made me happy is Aaron Eckhart's Two Face.The two sided villain has always been my favorite Batman enemy and you can't imagine what joy it is to see him on the big screen exactly as he should be - evil,menacing and deadly and of course relying on his faithful coin.The whole Two Face story in the film is what intrigued me the most,seeing Harvey Dent as a person who fights against crime as much as Batman but unfortunately under circumstances turned into a criminal himself.The other bad guys are amazing too specially Eric Roberts who does one of his finest roles yet and shouldn't be overlooked.The twist and turns are plenty and you can never predict what will happen next.The action sequences are spectacular and epic of course and Nolan has improved his direction during the action scenes,the camera isn't so close to the fights and you get a clear view of what's going on.Just like its hero the movie is dark,the colors are dark in tone and you can literally feel the darkness Of Gotham City.In conclusion this is one of the best movies of recent years and for me one of the best ever.watch it and be amazed.",1
"Sure it was a good prison movie, and much better than many other movies I've seen.  But this does NOT beat Godfather, Star Wars, or Casablanca in any way.  Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot, but don't expect a present-day classic ala Forrest Gump.",1
"Christopher Nolan , does it again. After making remarkable movies like Memento, The prestige and the spectacular Batman movies Chris has outdone himself with Inception. The trailer does not really give away much about the movie, so I was a little apprehensive first to watch this movie. But I could not resist watching it in the theaters and hence I saw it on the very first day.What can I say it simply blew my mind. What a brilliant idea and imagination. The movie is so gripping that it simply glues you to your seat. There was never a weak moment in the entire movie. The plot is a little complicated but it unfolds itself so cleverly that you will be left begging for more. I must admit it requires a lot of concentration to actually understand the plot, but once you understand it its simply amazing. Apart form the writing the movie stands out because of the cast. Every character was such beautifully crafted and I specially liked Mal played by Marion Cotillard. Eames played by Tom Hardy, earlier seen in the movie Bronson (watch it as soon as possible, if you haven't seen it yet) was enchanting. Ellen page, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also played there part really well. Finally,Leonardo DiCaprio at his best again , he has played the character of Cobb so well, that I would not want to see him as any other character for the next few years. The movie has such an insane and brilliant story and it is carefully executed and presented on such a beautiful canvas. The cinematography was excellent , visual effects crisp and not overdone, the editing by Lee Smith was so crisp and precise that I would watch any movie which he edit hereon. The music by Hans Zimmer is so gripping that it takes you on a ride. I will not explain the plot here as you have to watch it to believe it and experience it. It has one element slightly similar to my another favorite movie(MATRIX) but that makes it even better. This ones definitely a 10 out of 10. I am definitely watching it again this weekend, probably again and again.",1
"The first time, i saw this movie, i had a big smile in my face, because of the excellent ending of the movie. It's a high Quality movie in every sense. I do like that story, the writing is great. I think, the movie is even better than the book of Steven King. The directing is great. The cut is perfect, the art direction is great. The Sound and Soundtrack fits perfect into the movie. I don't know even one aspect, why i should not like it. It's the all time number one for me. That means, it is my absolute first place. The perfect movie! It's a great film about humanity under bad conditions. So everyone can see, that even in bad places is humanity. And even if there are bad People who want to break humanity between others with their might and power, they can't really destroy it. And the movie knocks down facades of deceitfulness. I like that! Sorry, if my English is bad. It's not my mother language. :) Greetings. :)",1
"This was a relief to me, after the incoherent disaster of ""Batman Begins"". Nolan has found a way to get this series into a regular orbit; that is, it seizes on an ironic tone and revolves around it.The value doesn't rely on any sense of originality; you can see how this Gotham is inhabited by ""Spider-Man""-type smart elites and dumb proletarians. The videotaped terrorist messages suggest those from ""Robocop 2"" (an interesting study all in itself), and so on. But the borrowings are OK this time, because Nolan's using a shorthand that we recognize and fits within, rather than works against, what he's doing.And it's overplotted, but that's nothing new from the summer movie genre. If anything, it's an advantage in the pacing of the second half of the film...we build and build tension with the music score and the action to a precipice, then...satisfaction with release. That takes editing skill.Because of Ledger's performance, there's going to be a mystique surrounding this film for some time to come...poor Heath took a trip straight into the asylum and never came back out; and with Bale's own current legal problems, viewers and fans will get the sense of a risqué edge to being associated with this, in a way, analogous to the air that surrounded ""Poltergeist"" for years. Nicholson's Joker worked within Burton's sense of camp...here, Ledger serves the purpose of giving voice to Nolan-as-writer, the prime mover who operates by his own rules -- ""no rules"".The best movie ever made? No. But a step above most DC comics material, without the preening of the Marvel movies. Worth a look, if only to have some perverse fun tagging along with the Joker.",1
"I saw this some 10 years ago when it first came out and I may have seen it in between then and now, but I couldn't remember. Having just watched Seven recently I thought it was time to revisit Fight Club. For it's day Fight Club stood out as a hugely original piece of film making. Utilizing brilliant techniques and special effects, it was quite something to witness. 10 years later, the film still holds it's own. It truly is a great film and stands out among a Hollywood filled with mediocre. Knowing the outcome, that Tyler is not real, makes a second viewing a altogether new experience, as the viewer finds themselves aware of scenes with the key characters in and figuring out how or where it is possible to have the characters and their actions work. The cast is fine in this, I especially liked Helena Bonham Carter in this. The visual elements make for a great film experience as well: The explanation of the explosion in the apartment: the appearance of Ikea furniture: the decrepit house and the airplane ripping apart are many of the stand out moments. There is some graphic violence, but it never seems to get too violent, despite it's nature.There are also some great film making in jokes: love the subliminal images of Tyler and as Tyler describes it 'flashback humour' when at the end the film continues on from it's opening scene.For today's world of 'Avatar' film making Fight Club remains a stand out piece of film making which is at times brutal, at others funny as hell. Combine this with some brilliant techniques and you have a terrific film and probably Fincher's best.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com.au",1
"This was an intricately woven tale of an innocent man. He would be our modern day Joseph if you will. What makes it so unusual is that he is a white collar tax accountant that ultimately has to use his knowledge to keep him alive and in a safer position than with the regular population of the prison. The characters and scenes are carefully crafted to horrify and titillate the audience. His wife the victim whom this entire debauched attempt at justice centers, is eliminated, early on as she is caught in an unfortunate love triangle whilst her husband is hard at work providing for her needs. He is then incarcerated for the crime and the action continues to build in one tragic incident to the next until he meets a true friend behind bars. The Sisters are treacherous. The Warden and Captain of the Guard maniacs. The prisoners are utterly lost, uneducated, and misused. There are many victims in this somewhat heroic tale. Had this man never been framed the light of reason would have never illuminated the conditions of prisons. They probably would have been overlooked perhaps another 20 or 30 years. He was the voice of reason that so eloquently told his tale of astonishing misfortune in the first person.",1
"In my opinion this movie is the best movie in the world. I will explain my idea in three section. firstly, i speak about the actors. Secondly, i comment about the story and finally i compare the movie with the book.Firstly, As principal actors and Directors are excellent. Frank Darabont did a magnifier work with plane and stenography. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were awesome because they immerse in the story.Sencondly, story is excellent because after the final nobody can think the final. In fact, ShawShank Redemption is the best movie in the world",1
"First let me set the stage so you might better appreciate my perspective. I love movies. It's so easy for me to give 7's and 8's on movies. Mostly because I simply enjoy watching movies. But I very rarely give out 9's and have never given out a 10. This movie is a 10. I feel as if I need to downgrade past reviews as a result. lol I went into this movie with some doubts. First I am a HUGE Jack Nicholson fan and was hoping nobody would ruin what I felt was a great last impression of the Joker (played by Mr. Nicholson). I didn't have faith in Ledger's performance either. Can't say I'm a fan of his. Not that I don't dislike him either but most of the movies he made I never really paid much attention to. Could care less about his Brokeback performance and felt he was becoming just another star they wanted to cram down our throats.Dark Knight is AWESOME!! I completely loved Heath Ledger's performance. I felt he stole the show. He left no stone unturned. Makes the actor who played Scarecrow (from the first movie) look like a fool in my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film. The writing was brilliant. Writing was a 10!! The veteran actors were superb and added much to the film in their limited roles. I will see Dark Knight again. I will own a copy of this film. There is no doubt in my mind that Ledger's performance in this film would have shot him straight to the top of the charts, even higher than before. Thank you for your brilliant performance.",1
"Once again, I fell for the hype. I went into the theater fully expecting another Titanic or Star Wars. Nope, not by a long shot. The Dark Knight is a routine noisy summer blockbuster with lots of explosions, gunfire, and car chases. Ledger's overly talky, Joker-meets-Hannibal-Lechter performance borders on the annoying; about two-thirds of the way through the film I just wanted him to shut up.Christian Bale is wooden in and out of the bat suit--I can't think of a single scene he dominates as Bruce Wayne. Far from being the greatest comic book movie of all time, Dark Knight falls well short of the first Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal is no Kim Bassinger, and modern-day Chicago is no Gotham City. Where's Wayne Manor? Where's the Bat Cave? Where's the friggin' gargoyles?",1
"I was really amazed by how Christian Bale played as Bruce Wayne/Batman in this movie. The Dark Knight had everything a Batman fan like me had in every single common way. Christian Bale is honestly the best actor to play as Bruce Wayne and Batman. He had the darker, bolder, and humor for the character. This movie also had the darkest and boldest side of Batman throughout the film.",1
This is a sophisticated and absolutely wonderful movie. He left you completely unresponsive to what happened two and a half hours before the end of the film. It's like a dream that makes you wonder and forget.,1
I truly love this movie. I think I have seen it twice and confident enough to give it a 9. Normally I love any movie by Leo and this was certainly another one of my favorite.,1
"I saw the poster in the Friday's paper. ""Inception; From the director of Dark Knight; Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. I wasn't aware of such a film. I've seen Christopher Nolan's Memento, the Batman movies & Prestige all of which were, mind-blowing. Later that day I started receiving SMSs and saw Facebook status updates praising the film. It was the trending topic on Twitter. So, I decided to check it out. On Sunday, I was inside the Shenoys theater, for the 3 o'clock show. I had a friend with me who was seeing it the second time. So naturally, my expectations were quite high though I told myself to keep it low. But what the movie had to offer me was beyond my expectations. Man, what a great ride I had at the movies. The freshness and the originality of it totally blew me off. Kudos to Nolan for conceiving such a phenomenal, high-concept, Sci-Fi heist film.It tells the story of a group of men skilled at extracting confidential information from dreams of their target by entering into his/her subconscious. Mind crimes. But this film is mostly about planting a new idea in the mind of the target. Hence the name Inception. Unlike Nolan's Prestige or Memento, narrative structure here is pretty much linear. But that doesn't make it any easier to fathom. We're taken into dreams within a dream within a dream and no 'Totem' is provided to the audience to know whether the scene is taking place within a dream or in reality.You could draw some similarities between this film and Matrix. But in the world of Matrix anything is possible but here in Inception you are limited to a certain rules. Any serious physical changes made in the dream could result in the failure of mission. The use of CGI was impressive. I mean there was no overplay but all the fantastic aspects of a dream were shown. I loved that scene where the point man fights off the projections of the sub-conscious of Fischer (Cillian Murphy) amidst constantly shifting gravity.I felt the acting was great. I've only seen Leonardo Dicaprio giving his fullest to a character (Titanic, Gangs of New York, Catch Me If You Can, Aviator, Departed, and Blood Diamond). His Cobb is no exception. Cobb, the leader of the team, is a man who as he gets in and out of dreams, loses his grip on reality and dreams, and constantly checks his totem. The Point man and the Forger nicely played by Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy, provides the comic relief. Ken Watanabe plays Saito who gives the team such a proposition. Ellen Page( Juno) plays a lovely young, Adriane the architect of the dreams. Cillian Murphy is another talented actor I noticed. He not only gave Fischer the necessary strength of a man who leads a business empire but also a certain vulnerability. And then we come to Cob's wife played by Marion Cottilard, who seems like a troubled and menacing character at first. Like all of Nolan's work, this one is also extremely well written. This movie demands repeated viewing. There are few things in the movie which still confuses me every time I think about it. The ending is something that will be debated upon unless there is a sequel coming up. There will be many blogs in future giving out explanations of various sorts about the movie. It'll be long before the heat created by the movie cools down. I don't really wish for a sequel but a series which delves deeper into the stories surrounding each character & explain some of the confusing details would do. All said and done, this is by far the best film I've seen this year.",1
"Since the beginning every scene has been detailed so well that it's difficult to find a comparison. Nolan has outdone himself and the JOKERRRR, hats off no word for him.",1
"Incredibly suspenseful movie! I was drawn in so quickly to this film only to be tossed around in the huge waves of thrill and suspense in this movie. If you want to explore the world like it's never been conceptualized before, this is the movie for you.",1
"From Christian Bale to the stunning directing of Christopher Nolan, everything is perfect in The Dark Knight, but what leaves you breathless is the magistral acting of Heath Leadger.",1
"Inception, another film surrounded by huge hype but doesn't fulfils my expectation. The film is undoubtedly very good but just not that good. The main question that many asks before watching Inception is, ""Is this film intelligent"". The answer is simply yes but also no. The story is original but you don't need a I.Q above average to fully understand this film. There just a lot of information thrown into the film that if one loses concentration he may easily find himself lost. But if you keep up with everything then the film is rewarding and simple.The acting is what you expect when you read the casting list. Dicaprio does a fine performance and is defiantly maturing. But there one main problem, the characters are hard to like. You don't hate them or love them but instead just listen to them talking about lots of things for two and half hours and eventually you can't help but wish the film will end. The shootouts were dull with very little creativity put in them. In fact the whole last act dragged far way to long.For me Inception is above average thriller. I can't see myself pulling the DVD off my shelve and encouraging people to watch it in years to come. There a lot of information being thrown at you and it extremely easy to lost your footing. Inception as a novel would of been an best seller but as a film, it rather messy.",1
"The movie is great, the book is not. Don't like the message but the movie is filmed awesome.",1
"When I saw the trailers for ""The Dark Knight"", I knew it was going to be a hit. And I wasn't disappointed. I highly enjoyed watching The Dark Knight. It's got the makings of a great film; An A-List cast, great cinematography, great story, and a large fan-base.The first thing that really struck me was the cinematography. The camera-work, coloring, everything is excellent. The dark nature of the story is represented perfectly in this film, and truly represents the story. Even during the fund-raiser hosted by Wayne, there is a tinge of darkness to the way it is filmed, and it really boosts the feeling of the story.The next element that really amazed me was the acting. Everyone's performance is top-notch. Bale makes the best Batman yet, and is perfect for the role. Ledger. What more needs to be said of his performance that hasn't yet been? Absolutely phenomenal. Eckhart especially impressed me with his solid run as Harvey Dent. He made a great new light to Gotham, but also maintained his performance as the crushed Two-Face. Oldman as Gordan was also great, as he is one of my favorite actors, and really brought all that the Batman's side of the law should bring.The story is just brilliant. Period.I do have a few, sort of complaints. The movie is abit overlong, it does drag in some places. I wasn't disappointed with the film, but I wasn't overly impressed. I expected it to be amazing, and it was. It was exactly what I thought it would be. A lot of my friends are saying it is the best movie ever, or similar thoughts. I loved it, but it's far from the best movie ever. It's a great movie, but I was actually more impressed with Begins simply because it was such a drastic change in vision. This seems like an extreme refinement of that vision. I do think the film is abit over-hyped, but I'd see again in a heartbeat.Everything was on-point, and it did not lack in any area. I was not disappointed, but I was not overly-impressed, and I think people are way-overrating it. It was a great film, but by no means revolutionary, more the perfect refinement of Nolan's vision.I cannot even fathom what amazing things we will see in the next installment. I believe the next film will absolutely break boundaries.",1
"It's not the number one rated movie on IMDb for nothing. I can go on and on about why this film must be watched, but to keep it short, this film is not just a prison movie, it is so much more than that. It's a character piece, it's about friendship, it's about corruption, it's about life in and outside of prison and how difficult it is adjusting from one to another, but most importantly it is about how important freedom is, and how you use it. Just watch it",1
"Shortly before seeing Fight Club, I ordered some new furniture for my house. I thought having nice stuff around me would relieve some of the stress and pain of a bizarre work life and reading the paper every day.How was I to know that Fight Club would blow this concept away, and show the true consequences of putting up with a life out of balance for too long. This is not a movie about bored yuppie testosterone junkies.  It is a black satire of consumerism, office life, corporate sleaze, and emotional short circuits.To achieve a place on my top ten list, this film has a fabulous look and sound, and a unique and compelling story well executed in every discernable way.",1
"Fight Club is a bold film and an attack on the consumer-driven life-style adopted by many people in this world. It is an original piece of film work that never ceases to surprise and never bores. Fight Club is a very well made film. Most viewers might think this film is simply about men beating each other up from the title and what they may have heard from other viewers but it is much deeper than that. This film has underlying themes that make you think about the life you are living and our consumer-driven world and is in fact relevant to our present times. Edward Norton is the Narrator and protagonist of the film. Brad Pitt plays ""Tyler Durden"" and is a figment of the narrator's imagination and is the antagonist. Both of these roles are well depicted and portrayed by the actors. These two are very talented and fit their roles well. Fight Club is rated R by the MPAA for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and language. This movie has several scenes containing brutal fights that have their fair share of violence and gore and it also shows uses of alcohol and smoking by the actors. There is also brief nudity throughout the film. Combining all of that with the F-word being used 76 times in the film it is no surprise that it is rated R. But that does not take away from how well this film has been made. Most audiences will have a hard time identifying the visual effects of Fight Club from the film's live action. Many of the visual effects sequences literally fly past the viewers, in one smooth and continuous motion. These spectacularly realistic sequences keep the story moving forward. David Fincher and the film's Visual Effects Supervisor, Kevin Haug, chose to work with BUF Inc. for most of the CGI-based effects sequences in the film. These groups of artists worked well together to achieve very artistic options for the films visual effects. They furthered the filmmaker's vision while advancing their own visual effects expertise. Fight Club is a film worth seeing, but is not for the faint of heart due to its violence and profanity used in the film. It is a artistic masterpiece and a memorable and superior motion picture. It is a rare movie that does not abandon its quest to jolt the viewer.",1
"Whether it be due to Heath Ledger's tragic death, suggestions of a posthumous Oscar, box-office records tumbling by the day, assault allegations made against Christian Bale, the protracted viral marketing campaign or maybe because it is the sequel to the hugely successful 'Batman Begins' - there can be no doubt that 'The Dark Knight' is the most talked about and most eagerly anticipated film of the year. The level of hype has been intense and although ultimately 'The Dark Knight' can't quite live up to the (arguably unattainable) levels of expectation that have been created...it doesn't fall too far short.We return to a Gotham City much changed from the one we left in 'Batman Begins', the mob are beginning to fall thanks to the efforts of our masked vigilante hero, it is very much a city at a crossroads. Bruce Wayne is hoping that his cleansing of Gotham's criminal underbelly will soon be over so that he can hang up his cape and hand over crime-fighting duties to the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). But in their desperation the mob turn to the mysterious Joker (Heath Ledger), a fearless anarchist who thrives on the existence of Batman and provides him with his toughest test. The Joker operates outside Batman's comfort zone, Gotham's noir daytime turns stereotypes on their heads as Ledger's villain terrorises in a light that Batman will never stray into.Director Christopher Nolan has created a complex beast; an action movie with ideas. So in amongst the motorbike chases, truck flipping, buildings exploding, bank robberies and murders there is a genuine sense of intelligent film-making and a complexity that is notably lacking from it's contemporaries. The word 'hero' is not a straightforward term and Nolan plays on it's ambiguity as he questions as to whether Batman is inadvertently creating more problems than he is solving. Is Batman the hero that Gotham needs, wants or deserves? As well as citing Michael Mann's 'Heat' as inspiration, much has also been drawn from the various Batman graphic novels. Ironically this is a film which has been hailed by critics as less a comic book movie than a 'crime thriller', when actually it is one of the most heavily influenced by it's source material.The lead characters are also carefully constructed - in what could effectively be described as a battle of the masked freaks. In 'Batman Begins' crime created Batman, in 'The Dark Knight' Batman has created crime. The characters of The Joker and Batman are carefully balanced and their symmetry is superbly crafted. Inevitably Heath Ledger does steal the show, his performance is irresistible and every bit as iconic as his Brokeback role. It's not so much that he overshadows Bale, far from it, but his screen presence is electrifying as he creates possibly the most charismatic criminal ever to grace our screens. Perhaps the most fitting tribute one can place upon his performance is that he not only matches Jack Nicholson's execution of the same role, but renders it almost forgettable.But this is very much an ensemble piece (which is precisely why we should be talking about Ledger for Best Supporting Actor, not Best Actor) and Bale displays once again why he is to Batman what Connery is to Bond. He suitably encompasses the three sides of the character, Bruce Wayne's playboy pretence, the real Bruce Wayne and The Dark Knight himself. Aaron Eckhart most notably is superbly cast and hasn't had the credit he deserves for the role, while Gary Oldman returns in usual fine form. The weakest cast member from the predecessor, Katie Holmes, is gone and has been replaced in the role of Rachel Dawes by Maggie Gyllenhaal. I had high expectations for the actress whom I am usually a great fan of but sadly she disappoints in unsuccessfully trying to recreate Holmes' character whilst also attempting to make the role her own.Despite a running time of over two and a half hours the plot never lags and despite brief spells of incoherence Nolan's story arc pushes all the right buttons. However, it's not all plain sailing. There is a severe lack of emotional depth in the characters which is highlighted most clearly after a key twist towards the end of the second act, in this respect Nolan's ideas got the better of him. The social experiment sequence also seems misplaced and unnecessary which unfortunately weakens the impact of Batman's final showdown with The Joker. And on a slightly different note, whoever was responsible for Batman's voice needs to go to their room and think about what they did, because that grating voice was simply excruciating. I shall not however sign off on a sour note. It is a fantastic film. It is a fitting epitaph for Ledger. It does deserve the box office and critical success. It is the greatest comic book movie made to date.Verdict: Everyone should and probably will see it. Not perfect by any means but wonderful nonetheless. The prospect of another sequel would be mouth-watering, Johnny Depp as The Riddler anyone?",1
Best tv show ever i love this show so much and i hope the audience of this tv show loved it and i gave this show 10 rates !!!!,1
"This film touches me. I believe it's the greatest film because I has an effect on people's lives. We watch a lot of films everyday but hardly we refer back to them.This is a film I apply in everyday life. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. The part I liked most is when Red said ""some birds are not meant to be caged; they'll fly away and when they do, that part of you that knows it was a sin to have locked them up does rejoice...""Indeed we should build our lives such that circumstances cannot cage us. All the while Andy was in the prison, his mind was outside.Indeed, salvation lies within....",1
"The Dark Knight isn't the best comic book movie ever made. In fact, it's probably not even a good comic book movie since the primary purpose of a comic book movie is to entertain. Despite the excellent reputation this movie's acquired over the past few weeks, the fact that it doesn't even fulfill it's primary purpose as a piece of entertainment seems to have escaped everybody's mind. And while it isn't exactly a sloppy film (indeed, much of looks spectacular), it fails to evoke virtually any emotional response whatsoever. People die, buildings explode, wrong choices are made and hundreds of other things unfold on the big screen, yet they bizarrely fail to generate any emotional reaction. The Dark Knight is both cold-blooded and cold-hearted. And while the viewer tries so hard to empathise with the characters and their seemingly desperate situations, he's left out in the cold.",1
"It's pretty easy for Fight Club to make the top ten of the year(I can only come up with maybe 6 films I really liked) but of the decade? Time will tell. One thing in it's favor, I liked it when I saw it the first time and loved it the second time.The only criticism I've heard worth investigating is that the film is a bad treatment on people who have mental disorders. Perhaps, but in order to further comment I'd have give away plot details and I(unlike Rosie O'Donnell who HATED it) think that's wrong.",1
"I've watched this movies just because it's the highest rated movie of all time. Also everyone I know who's had watched this movie prior to me was going like, ""Greatest crime movie ever"". Honestly I don't think it deserves that title. There are lot many and way better movies than this one. But talking about this one in particular, great screenplay, good character building, more than sufficient suspense, and a good old ""Happy Ending"". Great one time watch. The concept of taking few pieces of concrete every day out of the wall and throwing out in the open seems a bit absurd to me, I mean that process would take ages to dig a hole through wall and then out of the prison through ground and that to big enough for a man to pass comfortably.",1
This was a really good movie to meand i would tell everyone to gp check it out,1
"Seeing The Shawshank Redemption for a second time reinforced my feeling of admiration for this splendid film. Although I am writing my review in 2014 -- twenty years after the movie's original release -- it seems as fresh and alive as ever. Top-notch performances by all cast members, exceptional cinematography by Roger Deakins, and masterful direction by Frank Darabont (who also penned the screenplay based on Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"") combine to make the film something special indeed.Co-stars Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins simply transform themselves into two unconventional prisoners. Their inspired acting helps us understand the virtue of patience and hope, regardless of how long and how much suffering one might face. Freeman plays ""Red"" Redding, a man who has adapted to prison life by becoming the institution's ""go to"" guy for various items from the outside world. Robbins is Andy Dufresne, a successful banker sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and lover. These very different men become friends who think decency and kindness are important, even in the brutal prison environment.That brutality may be very hard for viewers to watch, but those disturbing scenes are necessary to give the film its gritty realism. Sadistic Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) runs Shawshank Prison like it's his own personal kingdom, and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) carries out the warden's orders -- very enthusiastically.Things change for the better when Captain Hadley receives help with some paperwork from Andy. It's not long until Andy is assisting all the guards with their tax returns. Soon Warden Norton takes interest in Andy and uses him for his own paperwork. The result? The warden grants little favors that improve the lives of the prisoners. Unfortunately, a new prisoner (Gil Bellows) arrives with a revelation about Andy's case -- one that creates chaos for everyone concerned. The only thing Andy can do involves a daring escape. But how? And what will happen to Red if Andy leaves? Although The Shawshank Redemption boasts a number of memorable scenes, my favorite shows Andy broadcasting an opera selection to the entire prison population. All the men are stunned as they listen in awe to the beautiful music. However, as you've probably heard, no good deed goes unpunished. Especially at Shawshank. Released in 1994, this acclaimed motion picture earned seven well-deserved Academy Award nominations including a Best Actor nod for Morgan Freeman. The film also won the Humanitas prize, the Crystal Heart Award from the Heartland Film Fest, and was among the National Board of Review's Top Ten Films of 1994.",1
"When Christopher Nolan and company delivered the superb origin story of Batman Begins, the shift in tone and ambition from previous superhero comic book adaptations was both riveting, and most welcome, if not curiously overdue. Using that as a springboard, The Dark Knight reaches places that are utterly stunning and overwhelming in the depth and scope they reach. This movie goes far beyond what any previous comic book movie has come close to, creating a haunted and comprehensive study of crime, morality, and tragedy. The story poses numerous moral and philosophical dilemmas for its characters, forcing them to make choices that can have devastating consequences, while also showing the duality that exists between sides of what is moral and immoral, civil order and chaos, truth vs. justice, loyalty to those around you and your own established boundaries, and the gray areas in between.While the vast landscape and powerful narrative that Christopher Nolan and his team have woven is a huge factor, a significant part of the reason the conflicts achieve such a forceful impact is because of the immense power of the performances from a talent heavy cast. Returning as the Caped Crusader/Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale continues to infuse the character with a remarkably conflicted and ultimately tragic quality. Bruce Wayne has troubles that have deep roots within him, constantly disturbed and driven by his past to uphold his strict moral code to deliver justice to Gotham, while trying to maintain a human grip on sanity within him, and for those he is close to. Bale brilliantly conveys this inner turmoil, in a character that is very low-key, reaching depths that his predecessors hardly even hinted at.As the loyal butler to Bruce, Michael Caine delivers another wonderfully composed Alfred, who more or less acts as Bruce's moral conscience, and provides the balance for him as well as the film itself. Morgan Freeman also delivers his reliable class to Luscious Fox, serving as Batman's technical supplier, and even manages to deliver some pertinent commentary on the issue of excessive individual power over a population that strikes a contemporary chord. In a much more central role this time around, Gary Oldman deliver's a quietly stellar performance as the righteous and unyielding Lt. Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal proves to be a welcome upgrade from Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, adding a confident edge and swagger to the character that was not as evident in the previous narrative. Other newcomer Aaron Eckhart delivers what turns out to be a startlingly moving, and forceful performance, very effectively showing the trajectory of the very determined and confident district attorney Harvey Dent, to his tragic fall from grace. Those familiar with the subject matter will be privy to what he sadly becomes.The most central newcomer is the Joker as portrayed by Heath Ledger, in what is a monumentally sadistic, maniacal, and frighteningly unsettling performance. While Jack Nicholson and past performers provided wickedly entertaining interpretations, what the filmmakers and Ledger have crafted here is something remarkable in its viciousness, and sheer nihilistic relentlessness. This Joker has very little that is amusing about him, no matter how amusing he finds everything else. He fully embodies his self proclamation of: ""I am an agent of chaos"", taking a sort of fascination and amusement at the notion of stripping power away from those that feel they possess it, and breaking down any notion of order that exists in Gotham. The Joker is like a constant moral plague on the law enforcement and Batman, constantly setting up scenarios which force them to make decisions that may violate their ethical codes and have dire consequences. As brilliant as Ledger is and as domineering a character the Joker may be, the fact that everyone within the story hold their own and don't get overshadowed is a testament to how strong the ensemble effort is.. Any overshadowing seems to be coming from sources outside of the film that want one performer/unfortunate story to overshadow everything else.The technical aspects are simply stunning. Christopher Nolan and his technical crew have created a vast and stark Gotham, drenched in a dark and moody atmosphere much like Batman Begins, where the weight of the city is felt in every scene in what is a masterful work of visual composition. The action sequences are electrifying, continuing from the first film in a gritty, near-realistic style that is minimal on CGI and heavy on stunt work with crisp editing, that along with the whole film progress at a relentless pace. The 2 ½ hours fly by, with a constantly imposing tension and sense of peril filling every frame.There isn't really much more one can truly ask from this electrifying, uncompromising and rich experience. The movie goes places that haven't been close to being reached in the genre, and transcends it altogether in a way that is immensely satisfying, and fulfills and I say even exceeds the promise that the first film established and has been built up for until now. This is in my view the richest and greatest comic book/superhero movie ever made.",1
Never heard of Heath Ledger before watching the Dark Knight.. His performance was amazing. He steals the spotlight from Batman in this movie. Great performances all around.,1
"Let me first by saying Inception skin deep is a 10/10 and is beautiful. But deep within the shell of hype is a movie that is still good but lacking at the same time. To all the people Who ultimately love the movie I see reviews like,""Couldn't wait to see this"" ""Masterpiece?"" ""Insanely Intelligent"" which just makes the movie reviewer seem very naive. To all the people who ultimately hate the movie, they always say things like ""I hate Christopher Nolan"" ""This movie is a ***** waste of time"" etc. Which then makes me believe that those people just have something against Christopher Nolan.In my opinion I saw the movie as nothing but a Hollywood movie. It was mildly entertaining and the cast was just a big name with no giant steps in their acting skills. I saw no hard acting parts besides them being themselves trying to talk about ""logical things"".The Reason this movie was mildly entertaining was due to the fact that the storyline wasn't as fresh as people say it was. The editing also seemed jumbled. Trying to cram multiple dreams in one instance in an unorthodox manner in a poorly executed way makes the movie just look even more pretentious. I have seen too many movies that skew the whole concept of reality and dreams and quite frankly this one didn't make me think too hard. Did they have to use pretty CGI? Did they have to have giant gun battles? No.... Of course this movie could of been way better if it wasn't ""Hollywoodized"" and dumbed down to make everyone interested in the action and CGI. Don't forget the decreased amount of talking about things that really needed to be talked about in order to avoid plot holes. Instead they just kept explaining the concept in a repetitious measure and never explained things in depth. Like for instance, the machine the Architect created. (""Architect"" Matrix again) I hate to compare, like most people, but I would have to say that matrix (the first) beats this. The matrix created a universe aside from a concept and also had a foundation to where something originated. In this movie they treated everything so calmly yet everything was so insignificant due to everything being a dream? (Sound confusing and irrational? Tell me about it) What you know and who you know is insignificant and the movie is a continuous Dream, in a Dream, in a Dream that was just piled together to make me think. Is this a Dream? That isn't very exciting to me. I am not over thinking. I am just not chasing a very uninteresting rabbit down a hole.I have seen it once, it was fun, its in the past. It has a less than 20% chance of me buying it on DVD when it comes out and it will soon be forgotten by me. There are more movies out there that blow my mind with their concepts then this one did. It was just a fancy effect, semi action, simple concept movie.",1
"All I can say is that some people have to do their research. This film is absolutely backwards and does not reflect reality. It was clearly written by someone who has no idea how the prison system works.The protagonist of this film, played drearily by the effortlessly dumb-founded Tim Robbins, is a white man. Not only this, many of his strangely old convict buddies are white. He is even raped by a white man who he attempts to deter with a mop; he's not a puddle Robbins, you bloody idiot!What the filmmakers clearly don't understand is that in reality, all prisoners are black and I'm NOT being racist, these are just facts. It's not because they commit more crimes, it is purely white privilege gone mad as no-one will accept them into their prisons and it is truly saddening to see so much money spunked out on another film attempting to hide this institutionalised love of these creamy coloured pussies.This is just another film in a long line of prison propaganda trying to brainwash us into thinking that white people commit crimes. Take Cool Hand Luke for example: as if anyone would convict Paul Newman. No! They'd be too busy trying to dive head first into his slacks to get a suckle of his lean member.At least Morgan Freeman is in the film, an allusion to the reality that Frank Darabont will not recognise for fear of being ostracised by the White High Council.Unfortunately, this is not enough to salvage this film and so I can only give it 2 stars out of 10. One for each true fact portrayed in the film. One, that there are black people in prisons and, two, that Tim Robbins would totally get raped in prison.THIS IS ALL A JOKE. THANK YOU FOR READING.",1
"Story of a man that over comes some challenges that would probably kill the normal man, or at the very least break him. Wife murdered, convicted of crime he did not commit, wrongfully imprisoned. From crooked guards to corrupt warden he out smarts them all even his friend. This man never gives up. Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying.",1
"This movie is just a classic. If you haven't watched this, I highly recommend so. It will stick with you for a lifetime.",1
"This is my absolute favorite movie.  The social commentaries in this male-driven movie were so true, and as a female, I was not offended nor disgusted by the violent scenes.  What 'Tyler Durden' made me realize is that I am a member of a brainless, superficial, materialistic society. For example, 'Jack' believed himself to be complete because he had a designer wardrobe, nice Scandinavian furniture, and a stable (yet awful) career, yet he could not sleep at night.  At the advice of a sadistic doctor, he starts attending help groups.  I don't want to give too much away, but the ending is wonderful.",1
"I used to watch this movie from time to time, and I enjoy watching it in every single moment. honestly this is one of my best movies ever, the story, the actors, and the scenario are amazing. This kind of movies have been missed these days. we need such this thing now Especially after the deterioration of the content of films in this period.",1
An amazing movie with incredible actors and a great director with an amazing script and a lots of expectations that become reality.,1
"This movie has everything. The cameras, the sounds, the really cool characters. For me, it's one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once. And, of course, Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says. The characterization is so much deeper than the other films. We get to see multidimensional people with purpose, even if the purpose to to kill and maim. We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride. A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself. Also, people do some pretty stupid things, considering what a threat this guy is. These are little things and without them we wouldn't have the huge finale.",1
"This film is about an ""innocent"" man who goes to prison for the murder of his wife. In prison he makes friend with an inmate and their friendship develops over several decades. He learns how to survive. Endures long hardships. And accepts responsibility. There is an incredible reversal in the final half hour of this movie, and I remember when I watched this in the theater - I have never ever seen a crowd in a theater cheer louder in my life. This is one of those movies you can watch a million times and it never gets old.",1
"When I'm talking to my friends about movies, we always talk about this one. Because everyone should have seen it. It is a must see movie and you won't be disappointed. The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies with a great story and acting work. I admire everyone that helped working on this movie because they did a really good job. I love everything about the movie, from the beginning till the end. This movie is a movie that reach you when watching it, it gives you special feelings about the story and makes you think about it. If you want to know the details and why I write this, just watch the movie. I can only say one thing to everyone who reads this, Watch the movie! And you will feel the same way about the movie as me.",1
"Don't let the title mislead you, I am not going to bash the movie, actually this movie is good, only that the hype over the internet(Heath's death and the Batman fan-support) effected the movies overall rating too much. I said this is a good movie. But is it the best ? Not even close. In its own category, it dominates most of the movies though, probably as good as Ironman and better than the first movie. Like most of the people, I am satisfied with the film but there are a few criticisms that I can make, about the fighting sequences, jokers screen time, and the process of the movie. First I wonder, why this film isn't called ""Joker""? Not only that Heath overshadows everyone with his performance, he also has incredible screen time as well, it is as if we are watching Joker as the main character, everything revolves around him. Maybe It was because there were too many characters in the movie, with separate goals and purposes, which also effected the process of the movie in my opinion. The story sometimes advanced too slow and sometimes too fast(but too fast in general) not allowing you to digest the theme fully.One other thing is the fighting sequences, the careography was not well made, most of the time it was too blunt, too dark and because of that, hard to perceive. Maybe it was the directors intention, but it kinda disturbed me, not being able to understand what was going on.To sum up it, the movie was just like I expected, but obviously below its hype, with a few deficiencies, a good movie in overall but definitely not a master piece.",1
"I had never heard about this film before. It was just one day while I was searching my local DVD store this year that I found a brand new, special two-disc collector's edition. The title attracted me, and as I browsed the internet before buying the disc, I was blown away by the response the film had got. I instantly brought the DVD, but sadly couldn't watch it for long. Today, I finally decided to watch it, and by the time it ended, all I had was the happiness of watching a heart wrenching drama and a smile on my face.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is truly a timeless masterpiece. It's a very old film, but no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna love it. This is a very emotional and inspiring prison drama which is worth watching by one and all despite of its content rating. Not only has the film been written and directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, it also has stellar performances coming from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Believe me, the two make the best buddies I've ever seen in a film till date.SR is a pure drama with some crime element thrown in. But it doesn't fail to impress and entertain you, and even surprises you before the time it ends. It makes sure that you get inspired and moved by the message it delivers with perfection. Another great thing: it has no romance to hinder the story. It's a heartwarming, effective and unforgettable character drama which makes you unable to get from your seat till the very end.Some think it's overrated, but honestly, it isn't. After all, this is a film which anyone who likes movies, especially dramas, can very easily appreciate. I just liked to see Tim and Morgan in a frame, because whenever they come together, there's something wonderful going to happen. The dialogues are brilliantly written: there are a lot of lines bound to be remembered forever.Technically too, the film shines. A film set within a prison could've been devoid of any visual excellence but the cinematographer has totally nailed it, providing us with the clear vision of what the director wanted us to see. Through this entire duration of 140 minutes, I felt a different range of emotions from sadness to happiness to even anger at times. It's that powerful.Saying anything more would sound like an understatement. Many others have already praised the film in their respective reviews, and I totally appreciate that. It's sad that such a great film wasn't a commercial success. But its real success lies in being the most memorable drama of all time. I really feel happy and lucky for having brought the DVD.",1
"This Joker will put a smile on your face! Batman History: Gone are the days when Adam West's campy Batman T.V series used to be the only source of ""Bat Entertainment"" for the audience. The Batman movies of the 90s did not do justice to the great comic book icon. They all made the caped crusader appear as a happy-go-lucky masked vigilante who saved the day at the end with his ""Bat Gadgets"". Where was the character development? A real plot? (Oh please, not the penguin-stole-candy-from-a-baby plot). The superficial storyline and lack of commitment catalysed the fiasco of the Batman franchise. All in all, much to the dismay of fans, a costly costume party was all that we ever saw!A Knight was born: 'Batman Begins"" at last delved into the dark and troubled past of Bruce Wayne. A man trying to find his identity, conquer his worst fears and overcome the grief of the unjust murder of his parents. A man who becomes invincible as a symbol. The magic of this movie lies in the fact that although it is not real, it makes you want to believe that it is! The Dark Knight: The success of Batman Begins opened the flood gates of great expectations and surreal anticipation for perhaps one of the most awaited movie sequels, let alone a Batman sequel. With expectations and speculations running wild, the overzealous promotion and media hype knew no bounds. The Dark Knight was put under microscope long before its scheduled release. The tragic loss of Heath Hedger, especially after whispers of his alleged over-the-top performance, added fuel to the fire. With fans and critics eagerly waiting to sing praise or eviscerate the movie alike, Dark Knight made a smashing entry! The question is, did this movie deliver? Did it live up to the unrealistic expectations of the fans? No. It surpassed it! This movie is not just for fans of Batman, but for all those who love to see a masterpiece. It certainly stretched the limitations of a typical comic book movie. The Joker is not just the avergae psychotic villain who blows things up and deliver jabs and witty retorts. No no no no no! He is more than that. A lot more than that. His every word has a deep psychological connotation to it. He poses moral dilemmas that play with the boundaries of normal ethical conduct and human psyche. Simply put, he puts people under the microscope and test their reaction under extreme situations. And he does it with flair! That's the beauty of it. He creates ingenious situations and traps that tricks everybody into believing something, while something else is happening. Bruce Wayne is pushed to such extremes that he thinks that his days as the caped crusader are coming to an end... As Rachel puts it, ""Bruce don't make me your only hope for a normal life"". We also find that The Joker and Batman have a lot in common. Joker pretty much sums up the entire comic book history between him and Batman as ""You and I are destined to do this forever""... Although they are portrayed as freaks with troubed childhood, it all comes down to the choices that people make at testing times. Harvey and Bruce are both influenced by The Joker's brilliant yet fiendish schemes and the outcome is colossal... You've gotta see it for yourself! This so much more than an action movie. A psychological thriller? Perhaps. The way Joker manipulates human nature is simply ""mind blowing"". Believe me, he is more than what you expect him to be in every single moment of the movie. His influence on Harvey Dent is even more intriguing than it is on the rest. And the fact that special effects are less prominent compared to character development and storyline goes to show that drama and theatrics impacts people on a personal level that all the CGI in the world cannot conjure up. It simply makes you care for the character rather than being a mute spectator of a violent showdown. This movie revolves around deep forgotten fears, traumas, hope, faith and courage. This is poetry in movie making!Rating: 10/10 No questions asked!",1
"I settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story structure and all the notes they hit... I just don't think they played them loudly. I don't like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie Holmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too, didya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the film to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a PG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some brilliantly conceived scenarios. I didn't believe for a second that the victims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would actually lose their lives, because it's blisteringly apparent from the onset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience beyond the minimum necessary plot points. The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance solid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of capable actors out there, and you have the same product. I think Jack Nicholson's output is ultimately more interesting, and I think that Tim Burton's original film, although imperfect, is still the most entertaining in the pantheon.I realize that to hardcore Batman fans, this is a wet dream having the grittiness of the graphic novels transposed to the big screen (if they say so; I say it came close), but riddle me this: If the same script was fashioned into a non-superhero flick, let's say Heat II, and had the same strong performances and production values, would the lack of Batman fan loyalty still rocket it to its current position on the IMDb Top 250?",0
"I don't think that in my quarter century of living I've ever felt more disconnected from the pop-culture at large than after seeing this movie. With all the hype and uniform praise I thought beforehand that this is at least a solid piece of cinematic craft, maybe embellished slightly by Heath Ledger's unexpected death.Unfortunately, this movie is rock solid proof that sometimes mass delusion can strike an entire society at one time. There is absolutely no way that this film can be regarded not just as a masterpiece, but even as half-way decent.Let's get to the point. First - the plot. It's just unconvincing as a whole. Batman is basically a side character with little to do as he takes backseat on the Joker train. He whines incessantly about how no one needs him and how he needs to hang up his cape. Do it already! His troubled relationship with Rachel Dawes has zero chemistry and it's hard to care about the outcome. The idea of Joker being an anarchist, goalless and malevolent force sounds good on paper, but it translates to aimlessness on the screen. Joker shows up out of nowhere seemingly with no one backing him and then... snap! It seems like the whole world is at his service. Not only he has no trouble hijacking a school bus (and then blending into a line of school buses after driving out of a half collapsed bank), hacking into the public TV feed or rigging an entire hospital with explosives; he apparently does it with such ease that the creators didn't feel the need to reveal a shred of information about how he did it. Many events in the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example - what was the purpose of Lt. Gordon faking his death? And why did they make a point of showing the scene where his family is informed of the death - was that just to get the audience to buy into it as well? That's just dumb and a waste of time. Why did Harvey Dent become evil all of a sudden? Sure he was badly burned, but he had to know the risks going into this business and he had a steely resolve just minutes prior. There are many other plot issues, but it's pointless listing them all. They are there and easy to spot.The acting in the movie is a-OK, but most of the actors just don't have any good lines as their characters are irrelevant puppets. Heath Ledger is good for sure, but his take on the character gets tedious after a while - mostly from overexposure. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress, but she's just so wrong for the role. She's a nice-girl-next-door type and as superficial as it sounds, it's hard to believe that she would have two hotshots like Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne chasing after her. Christian Bale has zero material to work with and they've turned Morgan Freeman into a moralizing nerd. Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and especially Michael Caine do a decent job considering the script they were given to work with.The screenplay is atrocious, incongruent and messy. It's like the movie was cut-up into a thousand pieces of varying length, reshuffled and then strung together. There is no natural progression of events and subsequent scenes frequently befuddle. It takes a couple of minutes to figure out what the hell is going on or why should we care. It's just poorly done.For all the car chases, fight scenes, and giant explosions, the movie is just unforgivably boring. It's a combination stemming from a poor script, naive (or barely existent) plot, flat characters (that can't be remotely identified with much less loved or hated), and a general lack of good sense. There is also an annoying feeling that the creators had a rather low opinion of the viewers intelligence or maybe they just rushed the movie and had to come up with a lot of material in a little time, hence the low quality.Before I end this overlong diatribe, let me just mention three scenes that I absolutely cannot get over with in terms of their pointlessness and stupidity. 1. Batman is riding his wicked-cool motorcycle approaching an aftermath of a multi vehicle crash and accelerates aiming it straight at the Joker. What he is trying to accomplish is never explained. One thing certain is that at the last moment he veers right, barely avoiding the villain, and drives his bike without touching the brakes, straight into a wall. I mean he drives it into a wall (or overturned truck, can't remember) full speed like a blind man. Had he even chosen to hit the Joker, how the hell did he expect to stop? 2. This one actually occurs a couple of times at least. Batman leaps out of a 20th story window and falls onto the ground unharmed. Unharmed! He didn't have a parachute, a bungee cord, and he didn't even spread his cape on the way down. He just hit full blast and walked away. And on one occasion his squeeze Ms Dawes fell with him and experienced a similarly puzzling lack of after-effects. Filmmakers, needless to say, didn't find it prudent to even try to provide some explanation.3. Joker enters the hospital in a nurse uniform. That should present a logistical problem by itself, but OK. However, not only he seems to move around the hospital freely, he also does it still wearing his face paint. I mean the lower half his face is covered by a protective mask, but the rest is clearly visible. What's even funnier is that Harvey Dent looks at Joker straight in the eyes and the face paint doesn't give him away until he takes of the mask. Is this a cartoon?",0
"Time for a corrective. As I write this review, The Dark Knight is, according to IMDb voters, the Best. Film. Ever. At the risk of incurring a hail of brickbats, I must demur. Yes, Heath Ledger delivers an excellent performance, as does Gary Oldman as Lieutenant--er, COMMISSIONER Gordon--and it's always a pleasure to watch Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart. But The Dark Knight is an overlong, over plotted, logically flawed, and philosophically confused film that cannot (and should not) be mistaken for great art. Compared to most comic book movies, it's not bad. Compared to La Regle du Jeu, it ain't so hot. The film's first half is actually quite good, and seems to come to a timely conclusion somewhere around the eighty minute mark. Unfortunately, this being a summer blockbuster, there's another 70 plus minutes to go, and the film's second half is a distinct letdown. Instead of ending on a neat and tidy note, The Dark Knight spirals off into a muddled mess of bizarre plotting (how DID that prisoner get the bomb sewn into him?), illogic (how does Harvey escape the hospital explosion--and why is he apparently impervious to pain?) and confusing action (too many ass-kickings in too little time). I don't expect 100% logical consistency from my genre product, but there are so many flaws and elisions of simple common sense in Christopher Nolan's screenplay that utter frustration sets in around the two-hour mark. By the end of the film, we're expected to believe that, for some reason, the residents of Gotham now need to revile Batman rather than reward him for his good work, setting up a police pursuit into the sunset that presumably will end with our hero receiving a ticket for speeding on the Batcycle. So let's tell it like it is: in terms of 2008 comic book flicks, The Dark Knight is inferior to both Hellboy II (which at least is charming and amusing) and Hancock (which raises far more interesting questions about the nature of the super hero).",0
"Obviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent issues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by recycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before, and the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He also comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by taking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them together.Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half the second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out until the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the joker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and irrational side-story of two-face. I'd have thought that a man of dent's resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took place, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to other people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar calibre to the joker.I really don't think the film got the best out of the actors involved, probably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he is completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping about in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his incredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho and the Machinist. Heath Ledger's performance was the only real solid one in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of completely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was farcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and stupidity of the situation.The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans approach of trying to make the film really realistic with an explanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a man dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be addressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a lot better because it didn't try to be ultra-realistic and took the comics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the prestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts at the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton.Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can write to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually watch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept away in the hype.",0
"Wow. Once again my faith in the rational persons ability to discriminate between depth and breadth, is verified, in that I have none.The film was long. Not deep. I think there is a misunderstanding. The film had the veneer of an epic film. It had all the right elements to be an epic comic-book adaptation to screen. Yet it faltered, mainly because everyone was so wrapped up in the idea of Ledger giving a career defining performance, they couldn't see past it. It's almost as if they accepted the brilliance of his performance before they entered the theatre, off of the back of the hype and the critics reviews, and all that was left was to actually watch it and be able to validate this belief.Disregarding Heath Ledgers untimely death, can you really say that he was a better Joker than Jack Nicholsons? I for one, cannot. Others have already said it; he had no back story. A character without a past and a motive - especially when they are a killer - is just not one that is appropriate to a story about good and evil. The things we like about villains is that we can relate to the reasons they do the things they do, whilst asking ourselves whether their reasons are justified. We get into a dialogue, and we ourselves get to decide who we side with - the good or the bad. This villain left me feeling flat and unfulfilled because he had no real motive, - making it impossible to choose which argument, good or bad, I sided with - and left me feeling like I was a voyeur, watching a guy kill loads of people.Everyone has been raving about the script, which I thought was plain dreadful at points. Others have raised the questions here. What was with his voice? He would make a great nursery nurse. The poignant moment on the boat when the sailor said something to the effect of ""They haven't pushed the button yet, because we are still alive"" was just plain embarrassing. The fact that Batman kept leaving in the middle of a conversation became irritating instead of cool and enigmatic. Why can't he just hear someone out. And at the end when batman runs home like Charlie, I was nearly dying in laughter. I could hear the music 'I've got a golden ticket'. There were other embarrassing script moments, but because the film was so bad, I can't even be bothered to mention them. The phone device for one was utter...The rhetoric of the characters in their oratorical moments was again, limp. It was as if the writer had started a sadistic, flowing evil speech, but had not had the tools with which to really elaborate. Because he had decided to keep the Jokers background exclusive, the speeches were neither funny or scary. They were punctured and lacked conviction.The fact that this is the number one movie is embarrassing. IMDb should take it off out of principle. If this wins an Oscar, I will never watch a Hollywood movie again.",0
"I'm very disappointed and this rating reflects my disappointment. It could have been so much better, easily. First, it's as if there's no obstacles the characters couldn't overcome by snapping their fingers. It's just too easy for the Joker and Batman to do all what they do. It seems the writers didn't want to be bothered by realism and it's one of the main reasons I didn't feel involved or excited at all. Batman pulls out technological rabbits out of his hat to move the plot forward - it's contrived and not entertaining. The Joker sets bombs anywhere he wants without facing any obstacles. His team of super terrorists can fill a whole hospital with explosives in a few minutes after it has been evacuated - or was it before? Anyway we don't see them setting up anything, everything is done off-screen and it goes into action without any kind of dramatic buildup. How did his gang do this or that? Doesn't matter cause there's an explosion coming soon. *YAWN* The Joker starts with a small gang but in only a few days or so it seems he builds a big organization capable of operating rapidly without flaws - a group we are told made up of many schizos and psychos from Arkham Asylum, as if they had all been released all of a sudden to join him and moreover in doing so became hyperobedient and hypercompetent robbers / explosive experts / terrorists / etc. Yeah. Right. As if running a criminal organization made up of Arkham inmates would be a piece of cake. It would have been so much more REALISTIC and ENTERTAINING to see the Joker having to deal with nutty and sometimes incompetent henchmen and we the viewers doubting whether or not he would succeed and yet pulling it off and laughing all the way up to the last confrontation. Instead he surfs on the action, survives all kinds of explosions and crashes and moves around as if Gotham City was butter and he a hot knife. *YAWN* Second, the style & editing of the movie was mediocre at best. You would think the Joker's first meeting with the mob would have something of a tension. Here we are introduced to Batman's no.1 enemy and he tells them they have to kill the Dark Knight. But the way it was shot the scene was cold, he simply goes in, makes a few enemies and leaves. And next The Joker invites himself to Bruce Wayne's party to kidnap Harvey Dent and he simply comes in, Voil_!, without facing any obstacles, there's no buildup, no dramatic crescendo, the pace stays the same, we get lots of quick shots, a constantly moving camera and even one or two 360 degrees around Joker and Rachel as if this was some kind of music video. There's nothing, no tension. And it went downhill from there, like a typical dumb action movie. Explosion, car chase, car chase, explosion, fight, car chase, explosion. Can't you guys come up with something original? And those action scenes aren't even well made. *YAWN* Why? After all you had an ace, The Joker, he should have had some cool crazy ideas to cause mayhem... but he didn't. He lacked the charisma that should be in such a character. Not that Ledger is bad but the character he plays has nothing special. He's cold, predictable and not funny. In Tim Burton's movie the man isn't just some psycho killer, you know early in the movie he's going to do his crimes with style and that he has surprises in his bag. He's a bit silly but you don't know what to expect from him - he's fun to watch. In TDK he neither has style nor surprises, HE JUST BLOWS THINGS UP WITH DETONATORS and he's not even having fun. Bbbooorrriiiinnnggg.I think a lot of people don't see all the big flaws of the movie because they like the characters and the themes. I like Batman, the lone vigilante fighting crime in his city and his struggle to retain his morality while confronting the worst criminals, I like Harvey Dent's character and the Joker trying to turn Dent into a madman like him to ruin his crusade against crime and I liked the Joker trying to corrupt the people of Gotham and turn them into murderers ...BUT THE MOVIE STINKS I really wanted TDK to be good, good at least like half of Batman Begins is, I wanted to leave the theater with a big smile on my face but I left the theater feeling cheated because I wanted to see a cool movie and I didn't, I saw a lame piece of crap. There was no climax, no great scenes, no drama, no tension, no substance, only over the top action scenes we have already seen elsewhere. This movie itself isn't a 1 out of 10 but I'm so disappointed by it that it deserves its 1",0
"I was very disappointed with this movie. I made the error of watching it, based on the high score it is recording in the reviews on the IMDb. I could quite easily have given it away after 15-20 minutes, but I persevered with it.I only persevered for one reason, I wanted to see what was probably Heath Ledgers last complete performance. I rated his performance very highly and he deserves to be considered for any of the upcoming awards shows, truly on merit.I thought that Christian Bale was miscast and unconvincing, as Batman and there really wasn't very much of a story line to the movie. I cannot understand how this is rated a 9 out of 10 at present. That must mean, that all reviewers are between 18-30 and you are all giving it nine or ten. Ten being the perfect score for the perfect movie, I think some of you have let your emotions get away with you.I scored it 5 out of 10.",0
"Well, this film is the most overrated movie I can remember but that doesn't mean it sucks at all. It's well made, with great shots and good acting (at least by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Heath Ledger). The action scenes are filmed more coherently than Batman Begins and that pencil trick was awesome.Still, there are too many ridiculous scenes (like flying out of a window with a cable attached to a plane and cell phones turning into radar machines) and completely unnecessary plot lines. Do I really care if Commissioner Gordon plays dead for half the film and his wife gets mad at him or some Chinese guy is hording the criminal's cash? No. Give us more confrontation between the hero and villain. Lastly, the dark themes this film deals with are taken a little too seriously for a movie about a superhero of sorts. He wears a cape and a mask and fights crime as a symbol... don't try and get me emotionally involved in any THEME greater than that. Develop the characters and make me care about them. The animated ""Batman and the Mask of the Phantasm"" did a better job with that.Whatev, i've rambled long enough. It's still a very enjoyable movie and if I see it again i'll probably like it more but there's no way this deserves all the praise it gets. I'd really give it a 6.5 out of ten but we can't do .5s and this definitely does not belong in the top movies of all time. Too bad because it might be worthy of a 7 or 8 had it not been hyped up like it was the gift of Zeus.",0
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.",0
"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth.",0
"This movie is a non-plot action-packed propaganda movie. Which wouldn't be so bad but the combination is such that it IS the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Seriously, when I came out of the movie theatre I was sick and angry at the same time. The whole movie is about approach towards the various kinds of villains, how they are and how they should be generally handled. You have about twenty propaganda lines, towards which each part of the film leads, those parts connected by a very feeble link. You could almost see the authors as they thought, hmm, we need to put this line into the movie, what circumstances will lead the hero or antihero to tell the audience this truth? Of course that made the movie a two hour drag where the twists and turns of fortune made you think if it wasn't a 10yr old child who wrote it. Ha, the setup worked we caught the Joker. Oh, Joker escaped, what are we gonna do? Then the good guys would realize that Joker wanted them to set up a trap, he wanted to be caught so as to get ..., escape and harm even more. Well, that is so childishly ridiculous, first surrealistic propaganda movie ever. So guys out there in the US remember. When you get spied through your cell phones, when your dear ones die in stead of a rich undercover agent, don't feel offended. Because to fight the ""crime"" or ""terrorism"", we don't need the good heroes (those apparently end up as dead half-faced wackos). We need dark knights. Sorry for my bad English. I needed to get this off my chest. So much approval, 9.2 user rating here, 94% on rottentomatoes, are that many people so simple or so easily bought?",0
"Yawn.A few years ago, despite repeated critical praise and entreaties from friends and colleagues, I gave up on ever wasting my precious time on earth watching another Steven Spielberg film. Time and again I was told, by others, 'No, this time I really mean it, it's a GREAT film,' and time and again I would leave the theater angry or nauseous. But, now I am at the point where I feel the same way about ALL Hollywood tripe. As with the Spielberg crapfests, I was told how wonderful excrement like Brokeback Mountain and Crash were. They weren't. Similarly, almost all the reviews of The Dark Knight were glowing; especially praising the performance of Heath Ledger (the cock-mumbling hero of Brokeback Mountain) as the Joker. And with his demise shortly before last year's premiere of the film, the inevitable chorus of Oscar buzz for his performance rose, with him, indeed, snagging a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nomination and win (ala James Dean). So, was this the greatest film of all time? Was Ledger's performance one for the ages?No.In fact, not even close. And, as badly hyped as the Spielberg stool has been, and as nauseating as the PC films named above were, The Dark Knight, and Ledger's performance, have to be the two most over the top unbelievably hyper-hyped things Hollywood has ever unfurled. Why? Simple. The picture barely rises above mediocre, and Ledger is nowhere near as good a Joker as Jack Nicholson was, twenty years ago, in Tim Burton's Batman.The Dark Knight simply goes on for far too long- 153 minutes- and gets worse with each passing minute. It goes from a possibly good film, in its first hour, to a barely passable one in the span of the last hour or so. A good 45 minutes could have been lopped off with no discernible detraction from the film. In ten years, few people will care about this film, and Ledger's Oscar win will go down as one of those great WTF? questions wiser generations will chuckle over. The Dark Knight is not good comic book stuff, it's not good sci fi, it's not a good action film. It's just hype.Yawn. (the sequel)",0
"The marketing worked well enough for this Batman. The viewers were convinced that they will see the greatest movie of all times. Ha! I'm not being surprised. Its Heath Ledgers death that helped to that kind of placebo. I deeply want to believe that those deifying ratings of imdbs commentators was only a short of homage to that admittedly great actor. I can understand that. But only that.Come on guys! Look into your mirror and ask yourself loudly ""was this the greatest movie i ever seen?"". It was just another Batman's movie and in my personal opinion a bad one.I spend 2 hours and a half of my life to see that crap and I'm trying to understand why all this enthusiasm? First of all the batman's voice turned the whole movie into a comedy. OK batman have to use another voice so they cannot recognize him. Nolan wanted a realism. Where is the realism when a little truck catches up and destroys the police's convoy, when only a policeman stays into the inquisitive room to watch over Joker, when Joker gets like he was invisible into a hospital where Dent's in there, when Dent shoots the car driver and the car capsizes but Dents gets out in full health and many other unrealistic things you can detect to the movie.From now on I'm not gonna trust again the ratings of imdbs users. The level went dangerously down. They put a second-rate movie upwards of masterpieces like like Pulp Fiction, Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver. That's a shame.p.s.: Why an actor like Michael Cain prefers to play in such roles man? He needs so desperately money? What the hell? I will give him my credit card. Qualitative cinema needs him most.",0
"As a guy who loves the Batman Character and used to own a chain of comics stores in the late 80's through the 90's I found the new Batman film to be abominable. The handling of the Batman character was the worst I have ever seen, and I say that being someone who hates all of the other Batman Movies (with the exception of Batman Begins). It was a classic modern tearing down of an iconoclastic hero that was less realistic than it's printed counterpart. The Batman character would never consider revealing his identity to appease the Joker, because he understands that you cannot appease pure evil. He would instead redouble his efforts to find the Joker, not eating or sleeping until he did. The Batman of the comics is a detective who uses classical detecting techniques, coupled with a healthy dose of bruised knuckles as he harasses the underworld to find his query. In other words he uses no shortcuts he works hard.Hollywood used the opportunity to make a political statement, having Batman build a machine that taps into every cell phone in Gotham City, allowing for the altruistic Lucius Foxx character to opine about this act of immorality. A none to subtle swipe at the Bush administration. Then you have Harvey Dent (Two Face) who as the DA of Gotham, is described by Batman as ""the best of us all"" killing two dirty cops, and to save the fragile collective psyche of Gotham City, Batman takes the blame for the deaths of the cops. Why it would not make more since to simply reveal to the public that Harvey Dent went Coo Coo after the death of the women he loved, as a result of another act of murder perpetrated by the Joker, with the help of the aforementioned dirty cops and the trauma of being disfigured, is beyond me. Save that it fits into the paradigm of liberal thought that the people are to be protected from the grim reality of the world. Better to tear down the real hero of the saga and have him chased by the police. Keep in mind that the film establishes that the villains of Gotham know from experience that Batman will not cross the line and kill the worst of them. but we are supposed to believe that the public of Gotham will swallow that Batman would kill two innocent cops. WOW!Batman is a character who is truly good, and he has been tarnished by this film. In a world where Superman in his last film was reduced to a peeping tom hero with a babies mama. Psychopaths like Marvels Wolverine and the Punisher are hailed as modern heroes. A world where so many young people leave the theater declaring how cool Heath Ledger is as the Joker and not how scary the character is, I find that world tragic. As one of our old comic shop patrons used to say:""Give me the days when a hero had a letter on his chest, a magic word, a cape and a pet or side kick. A hero that fought the bad guys because he was good and they were bad and they needed their a$$e$ kicked. Let justice be done.",0
"I am deeply shocked?. I am really shocked that this film made it all the way to the top. It's OK with me that it is a huge success at the box office. I can cope with it that many, many people do not have the same taste as me. Even though it is a little sad because I think this somewhat strange taste of the comic buffs will influence the movies in the future even more. There are interesting articles about the influence of the bloggers and hardcore fans on producers and directors. What really shocks me here is that many, many acclaimed critics fail to see how bad this movie is. They write about hidden stories, meanings and messages. The war in Iraq, the war against terrorism, a reflection of American society and so on. They write about hilarious performances of the actors. They write about stunning visual effects. Some of them may even write about the tremendous script. Fortunately so far I did not read anything about the scriptwriting. So I try to begin with that issue. Well, the script is so down, down, deep down below that I don't even know where I shall begin. I guess the guys who are more in the comic stuff will tell you that Jonathan Nolan really did a good job in adopting the stories and the mood of the comic books. But for me this is no reason to write a story that lacks everything and is so brain dead that I'm gasping for air. The plot is annoying and predictable. The characters are written really poorly. First of all Harvey Dent. His turning into a fallen Angel is so incredibly incredible. It may result from the way that the brains of the comic buffs work. 9 Pictures or less per page. I that time you can turn from a white hero into a black devil. But this is a movie. And no 9c trash book. To say it clear ? and you may have noticed ? I am no comic fan. But I like for instance Sin City very much. It is a very good adaptation into a now medium. And it is visually very interesting. Visuals. As I said Sin City is visually very interesting. The dark Knight is not. Totally not. Almost two decades before we saw TerminatorII. Oh my god, this was something new. And Two Face ? Aaron Eckhart looked a little like the wrecked Arni back then. Don't get me wrong the make up apartment did a very good job. It is just so sad that we already saw it all before. (Just like the inspection of the new weapons? Is this a scene of one of the Bond Movies?) Or take the Matrix (Part1) about one decade before. Visually the dark knight is not one tick better or more interesting. Maybe on the same level. Sin City was something new. The dark Knight shows us common techniques in a slightly higher perfection. The directing is average. Not outstanding. It must have been a logistic masterpiece, OK. But we have seen it before. The acting. I can't even say if the actors are bad. I think it is the story that is so poor. The Joker is good. Heath Ledger is good. Not brilliant or something like that. It is solid work. And he is the only character that is somewhat interesting and not full of pathetic crap. Well to draw the conclusion again. I can live with it that this movie is that successful at the box office. I can not live with the super high praising comments of professional critics. For action entertainment this movie is too long. At least one hour is simply annoying. (Again the writing.) So, who ever has some bucks left go see this movie and see what brain damaged means.",0
"I know this review will get a bunch of unhelpful votes but somebody has to tell the truth here! The Dark Knight is wildly overrated and is the most overrated movie of all time. Forget Titanic, Boondock Saints and King Kong(2005). This movie surpasses them when it comes to sheer hype. For the record I love Batman Begins. I thought it was a fresh beginning on a series that was rendered ineffective by that lunatic Joel Schumacher. Christian Bale fared well as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and the rest of the cast did a great job also. But this movie.... Everything that made Batman Begins so great is absent from this pretentious slop. Most of the cast look like they'd rather be somewhere else. Let me break it down this way with what stinks about this movie.The plot: Idiotic beyond belief. Joker(Heath Ledger) plans to kill city officials while playing childish games with Batman. Most of the time he's killing the people he's aligned with making him the most moronic villain in superhero movie history. Batman joins forces with Commissioner Gordon to stop him.The acting: Christian Bale is wooden in both roles(Batman and Bruce Wayne). He spends most of the movie looking like he's stoned out of his mind. And what is up with that voice? In Batman Begins he sounded cool like one of the gangsters from those old 1940s flicks. Here he sounds like Dirty Harry with strep throat. Aaron Eckhart is flat as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. While his Two-Face was better than Tommy Lee's Two-Face looking good by default is never good. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman sleepwalk through this whole movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite awful as Rachel Dawes. Katie Holme's Rachel Dawes was a strong willed lawyer that fought for what's right. Maggie's Rachel Dawes needs to grow up and find some better priorities. I agree that she is a step up from Katie Holmes but she plays Rachel Dawes like some silly high school girl with a pathetic crush on Bruce Wayne. The fact that we are asked to feel sympathy for her when The Joker captures her is a bit of a stretch. Her getting roasted made my day though lol!Now for the talk of the town: Heath Ledger as Joker. Heath Ledger's performance was okay but to say that he was better than Jack Nicholson's Joker is hilarious to say the least. Jack Nicholson's Joker had style, a plan and was pretty funny as well as unpredictable. Of course he was silly but he was fun. Heath Ledger's Joker is predictable with no back story and had no real plan. Just random acts of chaos. Ra's Al Ghul had a plan, The Joker of Batman 1989 had a plan, The Penguin of Batman Returns had a plan. This weirdo had nothing but bluff. Plus he's has no fun with what he does and spends most of the time ridiculously philosophizing like those corny emo-goth kids that smoke copious amounts of cigarettes while yapping about the misery of their lives. You complete me? That's about as cheesy as the Tumbler turning into a crappy motorcycle. Speaking of Emo-Goth kids that exactly what this Joker is. Only people actually find him cool instead of pathetic.Action sequences: predictable to a fault. Car chase and fights scenes plus they are quite unrealistic. People get punched, kicked, shot, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without bumps, bruises, cuts or blood. Now, Im not a gore hound but if you get shot or bitten by a dog, I would expect to see some blood. Not in the Dark Knight though. Pacing: The movie builds up a pace to slow it down after wards and with all the action on the screen the movie still finds time to be boring. Plus at 2 hours and 32 minutes this movie feels longer than it needs to be. Various subplots that never connect best describe most of this movie.Conclusion: The Dark Knight is the most overrated, most hypocritical, most pretentious piece of garbage in the history of cinema. The only people that would like this are the fanboys and I cant believe that people are trouncing Tim Burton's Batman movies to foam at the mouth like rabid dog groupies over this overcooked sequel. You pseudo-intellectual snobs don't seem to realize that those movies were great for the time they were made in and they were fun. Tim Burton made the type of Batman movie he wanted to make without trying to please these shills. I must have seen the Tim Burton Batman movies more times than I can count and still have a ball watching them till this day. I saw this dreck three times and still couldn't get into it. Its not even fun. Its a plodding mess that gets more hype than it deserves. Matter of fact, I'll tell how much I didn't like it. For months I had The Dark Knight on my computer for free via z-share and when my computer suffered from a virus that force me to erase the whole thing, this was the only movie through z-share that I never tried to get back. That should tell you everything you need to know about my feelings on this movie. Two Thumbs down.",0
"This movie was so wildly praised by critics and fans alike that it was hard not to have somewhat diminished expectations. It can't be *that* great, right? Right.I can't say this is a bad movie, just not a very interesting one. It begins promisingly with a superbly executed set piece, with the Joker staging a daring bank robbery. This is a very nicely done action sequence, and Heath Ledger's Joker does indeed live up to the hype. It's a genuinely strange characterization, and the story built around it should work.After that, the movie starts to drag. There are far too many long, talky sequences, followed by the usual slam-bang action scenes that are shot from a distance so you can't see what's really going on. What's really missing from the action is any sense of a story; there's just more of the same that you usually see in a superhero picture. Been there, done that.Another fatal mistake is one that happens far too often: too many villains. This was a major problem with the 90s Batman films: you have to squeeze the Penguin and Catwoman and Christopher Walken into one film, with no time left for anything like character development. In this movie, the focus is on the Joker, but that's not enough: we have Two-Face into the mix (who only becomes Two-Face at the two-hour mark, leaving only a short time for him to be dispatched by our hero).Two-Face was my favorite of the old Batman Rogues Gallery, and he deserved a story all his own. Throwing him in as an afterthought to the Joker (particularly when Ledger's scenery chewing overshadows everything else in the picture, including Batman) both makes the film far too long, and blunts its impact.Lost somewhere in all this is Batman, who almost seems absent from the picture. Although he has to make a tragic choice, there seems to be no character development, and Bale's performance is practically phoned in. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman contribute their customary gravitas, but again this just adds to the extreme length of the picture.Batman Begins was a strong picture, and I'm puzzled as to what I'm missing here. I saw this on Blu-Ray and found myself reaching for the remote every ten minutes or so, to see how much longer I was going to have to watch this. I finally hit Stop by accident at 2 hrs., but decided to just let it go. This movie failed to engage my interest on any level and I just wanted it to end.",0
"I was expecting to see at least a semi-good movie but this film is not even up to par. This film gets a 1 rating from me because it tries to depict Batman and fails miserably at it. Even for an action movie if Batman hadn't been in it, it's not good. The plot is horrid and morbid, the amount of gore unhealthy and the fight sequences are badly done. Notable problems:A. What is this rock theme music that's constant in the movie? It comes whenever a suspense scene starts and sounds like an annoying electric guitar. What is this doing in a Batman film? Also, the plot seems to be totally disconnected in between scenes. The entire movie is like one big mishmash of 10 different stories that occur in succession. It is also unrealistic many times. In the beginning The Joker simply takes his schoolbus into the convoy to escape. And the way he avoids police in broad daylight and blows up the hospital is unbelievable.B. The Joker in this film is someone with a predilection for violence and violence alone. Traditionally, The Joker has been a nefarious, insane character. He does things that are out of kilter with normalcy. He then laughs at what he does and takes unexpected delight in it. This Joker is not like so. He's simply a disturbed psychopath who likes to blow up things and harm others. There's no depth to the character.C. Harvey Dent has been traditionally Black the last 2 decades. That and the way he's made into Two-Face in this movie is totally wrong. Two-Face traditionally goes on to become a crime boss but in this movie, he simply dies soon after coming into being. He also isn't a good Two-Face, overusing his coin flip to make decisions. For example, in the limousine scene he flips the coin again and kills the driver in order to eliminate a crime boss. The real Two-Face wouldn't have cheated like this once the coin makes a decision for him.D. Batman himself doesn't appear much in the movie. We are shown glimpses of him and the fight scenes are very darkly lit so it's hard to see who and how he's fighting. His over-reliance on technology is also not good because Batman usually uses wits as well as brawn. The voice of Batman is guttural sounding and Bruce Wayne himself doesn't seem to have any emotions. Micheal Keaton's portrayal of Batman in Batman (made in 1989) is by far the best in all movies.The Dark Knight is not just not a good Batman film. It's a poor film in any genre. I recommend watching Batman (1989) if one wants to see an excellent Batman film. Here's a small sample from this great movie that's better than the entire The Dark Knight:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC249jPbBDY",0
"OK I waited a really long time to actually see this movie.. mostly because of the hype.. I wanted to see if after all the long drawn out hype of Heath Ledger's death... its #1 spot on the IMDb boards.. and all the back and forth conversations on whether it or not it was the greatest film of all time... it could actually live up to that standing.The simple answer is no.1. Writing 6/10There are a lot of points in this film where the dialogue feels really rushed and just awkward. I don't understand why batman begins (which in my opinion far exceeds this film) could do everything right with the screenplay and this one fail so badly. The standard plot devices are there good/evil good as evil.. downfall of the hero.. redemption .. blah blah blah... its all been done before.. and I might add done much better. One quick film which comes to mind.. ""There will be blood"" used a very similar thesis of the antihero but did in a much more intelligent and beautiful way. 2. Visuals 7/10Yes there are a lot of very impressive effects in this movie.. the tractor flipping being one.. and the whole opening sequence.. but again where have we not seen any of this before in a michael bay project or hell even the die hard movies? There is no signature to the cinematography and nothing which sets it apart from any other big budget Hollywood movie. Id say the most stand out moment of the entire thing was seeing harvey dent's face after the accident.3. Characters 2/10OK if hear a Batman talk like that again I swear im going to walk out of the theatre, What a horrible horrible disaster . Christian Bale sounded like he had one of his batarangs stuck in his throat. I don't know who decided on this plot device but it was a mistake. I don't remember any of this in Batman Begins and imo it really brought the project as a whole down. Heath Ledger was OK. Whenever an actor passes away prior to the release of his film of course there will be a strong tendency to have a biased opinion to how great he was. It really felt like he was overdoing it. If he took his acting down a notch I think his vision of the joker would have been much more believable. And possibly shooed him in for an Oscar nod. About the only really believable character in the film was Gary Oldman's ""Jim Gordon"" But than again anything he does his great.4. Overall 5/10A good action movie... But seriously overrated. 007 in a Bat Costume. PS#4 currently on the IMDb top100? Someone's getting paid.",0
"This was one of the worst movies ever made. Never before have I witnessed a more confusing and convoluted mess. There were about ten subplots, but there was no main plot. The Joker existed to run amok and to represent the ""honest villain"", that is, he didn't mess around and play games like most villains, and he didn't do it for money, he just killed and wreaked havoc for the heck of it... okay, that's fine. But in having the Joker purposely ruin all the other subplots involving other bad guys, it basically made all the energy in having to keep up with the subplots involving these other people come to nothing. It was very tiresome realizing that everything you witnessed, after two hours of non-story action and hammy performances, really didn't mean a thing, kind of like when a movie shows that ""it's all a dream"". It might as well have been a dream. Because in this complete mess of a film, nothing mattered. The Joker had no purpose - which was intentional. But since the rest of the movie had too much purpose, or rather, tried too hard to have all the purpose in the world - it all came together like a big explosion... then, nothing. Just ruins. And two and a half hours of my life wasted. As for Heath Ledger, he wasn't terrific. He wasn't amazing. He was horrible. Weak. Sounded like a nerd. And he claims to have studied from ""A Clockwork Orange"" (please!), but he seemed more like he was doing a Johnny Depp impression, being silly and androgynous. It's just such a mess of a film. Horrible, simply horrible. And the reason I haven't mentioned Batman himself, is that he was so nothing, that there isn't anything to say about him. The main character seems more like a Vin Diseal character, and not a comic book hero. I understand trying to make the franchise more serious after being ruined by Joel Schumaker, but this film doesn't resemble a comic book in any way at all. It could have been a cop film, only the main cop had pointy ears, and the main villain had really bad makeup.",0
"The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it should've borrowed).",0
"There were just too many subplots, too much violence, and it was at least a half hour too long. They should have taken some of the time they spent planning CGI effects and used it to seal some of the plot holes: 1. A witness pulls a gun out while he's on the witness stand? Excuse me?? This is some mythic land where the courthouses don't have metal detectors? 2. There's a terrorist threat against a hospital, so they evacuate every patient--*except* the one who's been in all the papers.3. The police are transporting a high-profile prisoner, with dozens of vehicles escorting him and SWAT teams all over the place--but one trailer truck starts chasing them and they're all helpless.4. The silliest thing of all--Batman's constant whispering. It's supposed to make him sound menacing, but he just sounds like he has laryngitis. It's like the old Superman TV show where people magically have no idea who he is as long as he keeps his glasses on.I know I'm way in the minority on this one, but I have to say this was the ugliest, stupidest movie I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I weren't trapped at the end of an aisle. You couldn't pay me enough to sit through it again.",0
"Wait until you see the atrocity that is 'The Dark Knight."" And you will see it no matter what I say, anyway, won't you? I've tried to keep this spoiler-free, despite the fact that whatever unpredictability the moth-eaten plot has is based on the surprise being completely inexplicable in context. So forgive me if it's a bit vague in places.The latest Batman film, lauded by fan and critic alike, was apparently replaced at my theater with another similarly-titled film in which Iron Man fought the killer from Saw, who is intent on reproducing the last ten minutes of Spiderman II over and over again. Everyone in the film is either an idiot or an omniscient genius, but either way, they are the most unobservant bunch of people ever put on film. The whole movie would have sputtered to an instant conclusion if the city cell phone network had gone down. And even The Simpsons has lampooned 'The Only Bridge Out of Town'. And the first moment Batman is on screen, he is bending the barrel of a gun unto a U-shape. I think somebody was looking on the wrong page of their comics reference guide when they wrote all of the super strength + flying scenes in for Batman.This is an Idiot Picture. There was no set piece in this film that would not have been avoided by a modicum of common sense. Honestly, kudos to Heath Ledger--whoever he was playing that was impersonating The Joker as someone with no apparent sense of humor--but any normal person would have shot the man on sight just to stop him babbling for the next twenty minutes. Every freaking scene was a monologue! Of the same thing! Everyone did that, actually. The characters seldom had conversations, just extended monologues which aspired to be weighty and philosophical. And not a word they said mattered, because in the end, it comes down to punching someone, anyway. The Joker has only one trick, and it is the same one three or four times. Bale's characterization of Batman and Bruce Wayne is so lifeless, he doesn't even seem to have been in the film.Technically, it suffered from being heavily edited, apparently to obtain a PG-13 rating. Killings appear off-screen or in obvious jump cuts. Events are alluded to which not only do not occur, but appear to occur differently. Was this the airline version? How long would this thing have been as shot? It already exceeded two and a half hours. Happily, there was plenty of opportunity for bathroom breaks. Every time someone opened their mouth you had ten minutes free. Still, sloppy editing cannot excuse the way characters simply appear and disappear as needed by the script, regardless of the impossibility of getting there unnoticed. IITS* is essentially a plot device.If this seems like a litany of nitpicks without mention of all the good points, well, as far as I can tell, I mentioned ALL the good points.This film viciously wasted my time as if I was a character in it, trapped in a theater with fifty hitherto-unnoticed oil drums and the option to explode the audience of Wall-E. It would have been a mercy.*IITS (It's in the script, that's why! Concept created by Ken Begg.)",0
"I know I am going against the tide here. And I am happy that so many people had a good experience watching this film. I didn't. Maybe I just don't get it? I'm not sure, because I am a fan of superhero films in general. I think perhaps what I don't like is a superhero film that tries to be so serious as to make us believe in it. Batman, and previously I would say Unbreakable, fall into this category. If you want me to take you seriously then tell me this. How the hell does a guy with his face painted run around a city causing mayhem without getting caught? How does a guy who kills his accomplices continue to have support? I mean he even burns the loot so money isn't the answer. How does a guy who claims he doesn't like planning (because he's too crazy to care about planning) manage to get so many barrels of oil and dynamite positioned all around the city with ease. How does he get said equipment on to the two very important ships? A city that is on high alert? Was there nobody to check? The list goes on and on. If the film wants to be taken seriously, I think it has to fill these holes. If it doesn't, then no problem. There can be as many holes as you like.Another bad point was the length of the film. Far too long.On the plus side the acting was very good, although I didn't like the overly put on voice of Batman. However, Ledger deserves all the praise he has been getting for this.",0
"There is nothing special about this movie. Period. Nothiing special. It tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie, and in financial terms, it was, but you know what? It's still not good, no matter how many fans it has, no matter how much money it pulls in. Those are just figures and numbers, and they're quite boring in the long run. Let's go over a few reasons why it was not good. First off, the story bites off way more than is necessary. We have Bruce Wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman he'll never have the chance to be with. The woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl, and really has no business being in the story to begin with. She is just there to make both Batman and Harvey Dent rival each other. I'm so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that. Then, there's the Joker...the most ridiculous part of the story. Ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain. It's not entertaining, it's not disturbing, it's just sick. This movie was not fun. It was not entertaining. It was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway, and especially because of the death of Heath edger. Let's talk a little about that. This film had success that rode the curtail of Ledgers death. The studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition. That's really sad, and you know what else? It's all this film will ever be...the last film of Heath Ledger, and America went to see it because he died before it's release. sad. Really sad. I didn't like it, and I bet others will not like me for that very reason. Even more sad still.",0
"Yes, Joker was really great, but overall this movie was a total letdown.A few totally stupid things that killed this movie for me.*Spoilers* Joker blows up a freaking HOSPITAL in BROAD freaking DAYLIGHT and makes his escape in an ultra fast SCHOOL BUS, which no cop seems able to stop, even though they've been warned that Joker will, you know, blow up a hospital. You see, this is totally believable because the cops apparently set up a perimeter two freaking miles away, just to be safe. It's not like they could have used a helicopter or something for surveillance. That would just make too much sense (sarcasm).Batman falls several stories to the ground, not once, but TWICE and gets up without so much as a broken bone, but hey, that's okay because his super duper special armor, (which is so strong that a dog can chew through it) protected him from the fall. That's totally realistic! Right? What's that you say? The metal roof of the Taxi totally cushioned his fall. Well, that's even BETTER! How wonderfully realistic. If I ever have to jump out of a burning building it's nice to know that a kevlar vest and a strategically placed car will break my fall.Police Commissioner Gordon pretends to be dead so that Joker will chase after Harvey Dent instead of his family (huh?) and Joker proceeds to kill six innocent people in the middle of downtown Chicago, uh, Gotham City, but this is okay, because by drawing the Joker out, the police are protecting the public from harm. No reason to clear the streets of pedestrians and traffic and stuff while transporting Harvey Dent as bait for a sicko maniac killer.Joker manages to keep a pencil perfectly balanced on a table while a large gangster stomps across the floor to fight him. Cool, but stupid.Joker burns a pyramid of money, because you see, money is not important to him. What's important to him is blowing and burning stuff up, which is exactly why he robs banks for a living. Makes perfect sense, no?Batman speaks with an annoying rasp which hides his Bruce Wayne voice because as everyone knows, Christopher Nolan wants this to be a REALISTIC depiction of Batman, which is why we have sonar cell phones in this movie and magic armor and explosive laced Bat Mobiles that turn into motorcycles which do gravity defying 360 turns on walls.Other complaints: There was no Wayne Manor in this film. No Bat cave. Chicago looks a bit too bright and modern to be Gotham City. Seriously, what is Gotham City without, you know, Gothic architecture? The girl playing Rachel Dawes is completely ugly, but for some reason Bruce Wayne is so obsessed with her that he decides to have sex with the whole Gotham City ballet, just so she can't go on a date with Harvey Dent.I know lots of people got drawn into the hype of seeing Heath Ledger's last great performance, but besides Joker, there is no redeeming value in this film. There's no iconic battles. No real hero to root for (seriously, you will hate Batman in this movie).Christopher Nolan gets a special mention for trying to inject at least some intelligence into a summer blockbuster, but there was just one too many stupid things to justify the price of admission. If you haven't seen this film, just wait for it on DVD.",0
"To start, I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins. Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, Batman is one of the best super heroes, but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather.This is a very good movie, but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it. Health Ledger's death had more of an impact on this movie's critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie. The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool, not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS. People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker. Also, Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film, which is quite annoying. After seeing the movie, you might even realize that Christian Bale's obscure placement throughout the film is a major flaw.The Godfather is around 3 hours, this is around 2&1/2 hours, yet this movie feels much slower. Rather than keeping a steady pace, the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out 30 minute action sequences. It's ridiculous.The best movie of 2008 is In Bruges, not TDK.",0
"This movie has proved again, that cartoon means junk, and whatever you do starting from a cartoon, it will still be junk. At least now someone else in Hollywood realized this, and made a real good parody of the cartoon genre. An extra joke is, that all this was masked as a serious superhero cartoon movie. Just some of the best hidden jokes I've found behind the cliché story:1. Batman kills at least a dozen of cops during the car chase, and makes some million $ worth of damage in the road, buildings. etc., but he is still the good guy. Sure.2. All the citizens in Gotham are totally stupid. First of all, they don't realize, that the only person, who has enough money to buy those hi-tech gadgets is Bruce Wayne, and nobody realizes, who Batman is. Second, it doesn't matter, that Batman's mask is covering only a small part of his face (his forehead and nose), they still don't realize, who is ""hiding"" behind the mask By the way, did you notice, that there is a face recognition software running on one of the monitors in Batman's hideout? The very same happened in the previous Batman franchise - looks like folks in Gotham didn't get any smarter in the past decades.3. Looking at the height of the pile, I guess that the amount of cash Joker is burning is more than there is in circulation in the whole world.4. All the mobs are stupid enough to keep their money in cash, so if they want to make a transfer, they have to hire a dozens of trucks. They haven't ever heard about electronic money. If they are so stupid, then how they can run a syndicate?5. Some billion worth of hi-tech gadgets is hiding in the basement of Wayne company. For years in nobody's mind turned up the idea to find a customer and make some money of it. They just wasted some million $ into it, and later they decided to hide it.6. The way the bat car and the bat bike moves is totally unrealistic. Also, such vehicles would be totally unpractical. For example, why are the wheels of the bat car in the front of the vehicle? Anyone can shot it with a simple pistol (these are rubber wheels), and game is over. The stupid design of the vehicle is proved in one scene, when Joker immobilizes the car (supposedly worths some million$ + the development costs, as this is a prototype) with a common RPG, which costs only a handful of dollars.7. When they bring down the chopper with the steel cables, the two guys must have know in advance, that exactly where (which street and what height) the chopper will go through. Keep in mind, that according to the plot, all these Joker sidekicks are mentally retarded people. And doesn't matter, that the chase is half a dozen mile long, they are just in the exact time at the exact place.8. Hey terrorists and wannabe terrorists! I have some good news for you! It looks like, that if you want to kill a major, then all you have to do is to get an uniform. (An uniform can be bought in any costume shop, you don't even have to beat policemen and take away from them like in the movie.) Then you can approach the major to point blank distance - the only problem is, that there are oracles in the police, too, who can predict the future, and jump between you and the major even before you pull the trigger.9. Blowing a building is an easy process. High explosives are strange artifacts, as you can move and properly plant hundred kilos within a couple of minutes into the designated places of a building. Also, when you blow up a building, you can stay 10 meters away from it, and you will suffer no damage from debris, rubble and/or air pressure.10. Ship crews are incredibly dumb. They can't realize that there are hundreds of gasoline in the engine room. Or even if they have found it, then they may have thought, that the captain is going to throw a surprise party for the whole crew, and in the barrels there is the stuff necessary for such party (vaseline).These are just some quick random things I can remember, I don't want to waste much time commenting this disaster. Let's not talk about obvious plot holes, pointless violence, superfluous subplots, and Bale acting like a wood - oh my god, why that deep voice when dressed as Batman?",0
"Is this what now passes for entertainment? Can this really be compared for depth and breadth with other generally highly-rated movies such as the Godfather, Casablanca or even Star Wars? Many of the IMDb top movies deal with the good old battle between good and evil and the world-weariness of the hero or anti-hero, but this film lands far short of the mark in both character and plot development, not to mention script, acting, screenplay or any of the other attributes of a movie that might be worthy of commendation.The purity of the comic book origins of this piece are thoroughly distorted and turned into an incoherent muddle - almost any James Bond movie has a great deal more tension, humour, conviction and morality than this mess of a movie. On the other hand, if there's a serious message in The Dark Knight, I missed it, as I suspect will thousands of others. As a Batman flick, it simply doesn't deliver anything like the expectations; at yet another level as a post-9/11, human-condition, search-for-identity movie it also fails - however you want to see it, it fails on a grandiose scale.For some of who do not live in the in the US, The Dark Knight has the potential to appear as little more than an appalling piece of hyped-up propaganda for a moribund social policy that permits and legitimises evil, mayhem and general wrongdoing and unpleasantness on a colossal scale in the pursuit of defeating the threats against society.I've had more fun at the cinema studying the architecture.",0
"It's hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together. Well let's start by saying that the Dark Knight is very boring and messy.The plot is incoherent, with too many undeveloped subplots. The movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere. It tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured, out of place, and doesn't build up from anything. Lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere. The characters have nothing, nothing interesting about them. They're like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor, taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are. And creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero, is what this movie is all about. All the rest comes as a consequence of this. Anything that happens has little or no effect. Batman is just as hollow as every one else. You could swap him with some other character and nothing would change. Action is just average. Random things happening out of nowhere, and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that. Some great effects here and there don't add much to the movie. I like violent movies but the violence in the DK is pretty much senseless as well as censored. Definitely not for young kids.The movie is not dark, is hollow. If you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome 'The Crow'. You want to see a good batman movie then watch the Tim Burton's version. Flat with no substance, humor or soul, the Dark Knight doesn't leave you with any emotions whatsoever, no hope and not even hopelessness. Only a lame sense of depression.",0
"C'mon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this.The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledger's last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker.To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that I've just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be.Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. This movie has no plot. ""The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham,"" is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why can't Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a ""civilized"" manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one.Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesn't give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes ""Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids,"" and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean.Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolan's vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfman's theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out.",0
"It's not often I find a movie plain unwatchable, but that was the case with the Dark Knight. The reason is plain and simple: almost every dialog feels ""fake"" as only 1 person speaks per camera point. Like with cheap soaps where they can only take care of the sound of one person, or where the stars don't physically meet that much. The lack of chemistry and realness resulting from monologues shot in series an then cut to dialogs, is bewildering. Staggering low-quality. I honestly found it unwatchable because of that, and what's even more bewildering is that this seemingly cheap or ill-produced production is considered a master piece by so many. I feel like the little child in The Emperor's New Clothes. What's going on here? Has everyone turned blind? Shockingly bad.",0
"Another example of an over-hyped movie, but now in extreme. To say this piece of junk should be regarded as the best movie of 2008 is ridiculous. Basicaly it is just another movie about a man in a bat-suit who duels for more than 2 hours with another badman with a painted smile, and in the process some quasi profound remarks are exchanged. No humor in sight to make the movie better digestible.Big budget, good actors and some clever make-up artists are no guarantee for a good movie. In this case it resulted in a very boring one.As for the so-called performance of the year by Ledger; he is (was) a very good actor but this one-dimensional role is far from being special, but I guess the Oscar will be his, Nil nisi bonum.Why this movie should be on par with, or far better than true masterpieces like the Godfather 1&2 and Vertigo is beyond belief.",0
"There is not really any reasonable explanation why there are so many junk movies with ratings over 8 in IMDb except the fact that unfortunately we are living in the age of materialism and total commercialism. Before mentioning anything about The Dark Knight itself I should point out that the movie business started as an experiment and furthermore, it was (and I hope it still is) art. If you are a part of the lucky people that had the chance to watch old movies (starting from the early 1900s) then you probably have noticed that despite the bad quality the technique and the style of directing, cinematography, acting and ""special effects"" are fascinating. They are modern, sincere, effective, touching. That's where art starts and flourishes. However, if you take all the pointed out and replace them with high quality computer effects, deafening soundtrack, good looking actors, banal plot and the appealing to the masses simple conflict of Good vs Bad; well, here is where commercialism begins its unstoppable brainwashing system. The Dark Knight fits exactly the formula. Nothing more to say. To those who agree: There are still some great new movies coming out. It just takes time to find them. Don't be discouraged by the overwhelming amount of junk films. To those who disagree: Well, consider watching Casablanca, Silence of the Lambs, Amadeus, Star Wars :p, etc? To those who don't take a side: Now is the time to do so. To Heath Ledger: You were just great and sorry to know this was the last time to see you. [17 June 2009]Later ... Here now as I watched the film for a second time so that I would be entirely fair in my judgment I realized that 8/10 is a fair rating BUT and only BUT when The Dark Knight is rated on a different scale such as ""Top movies based on a comics"". And what is a comics other than a combination of a simple plot, good vs evil, black and white characters, lots of action? The end. When a movie has nothing more to add - no fair character development/acting, no original twists in the chain of events, no unique directing techniques... then one cannot give it more than 5/10. And since the IMDb has a great image the only way users can help keeping it safe and sound is by taking a little more seriously their voting rights. [30 June 2009]",0
"My lack of faith in the audience is justified, how can this film be so highly rated when it's total garbage. Batman was my favourite comic book, the dark tortured hero really appealed to me. But this film really is a mess. Where do I begin? Probably the biggest problem of any bad movie, the characters.BATMAN The one we're supposed to identify with and feel his plight, is so wooden in this film that I could mistake him for a tree. Christian Bale's Batman seems devoid of any emotion or any internal plight, Plus in a film that is supposed to be about him, Batman seems relegated to a supporting role. In TDK he's merely a goon with a bad case of laryngitis. I know he's supposed to disguise his voice, but it's so over the top it's laughable. This is were Keaton and Conroy got it right, he seldom talks, when he does the voice change is subtle. Not sounding like a goon on a sugar high.The JOKER, The main villain. Heath Ledger's performance is good with what he's given, But the writing for the Joker is all wrong. Joker in this film is actually a very generic psychopath. If it wasn't for the make-up I would have never guessed it was supposed to be the Joker. The Joker isn't supposed to be a nihilist. Everything to him is a big joke, even murder has to be funny to him. Ledger's Joker lacking virtually any sense of humour, he's more akin to Jack the Ripper who seems to have an obsession with knives and scars. Also what put me off is how the Joker always looks physically ill. Constantly hunched over, waddling about, constantly licking and smacking his lips like his saliva is on overdrive. This simply doesn't work for a clownish criminal amusing himself.With the exceptions of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, the actors in the film just seemed rather lazy. Like they wanted the film to end as quickly as possible and collect their pay cheque. Why in a film where characters are supposed to be the central focus be so wooden and one dimensional with them. The film flops completely on it's characters The directing was equally sloppy. A lot of pointless noise and generic action scenes that seem to be put in as filler in order to extend the film to the 150 minute mark. Excessive cuts that make the action difficult to follow and often in poor light where we can't see anything. Equally pointless was the plot, in fact it's more a collection of subplots, none of them with any closure or resolution to them. With the sloppy cuts, it also leaves enough plot holes to sink this film into an incoherent mess.Yet I hear this film heralded as a masterpiece, I see critics and fan reviews who just gush over this film. Has the standard of film making really reached this low? 20 years ago, a film called Robocop came out. A very silly concept at it's core, but the characters are what made the film work. We could identify with Robocop ironically enough.Tim Burton's despite it's plot flaws, The characters were well created and acted and kept to the spirit of the source material. TDK has no such redeeming features.",0
"How can a film like this be ever compared to a film like the godfather is laughable, i am a big comic book and superhero fan i particularly like this genre but i did not like the way this was handled whatsoever..the following points highlight my case why batman is nothing but a okay film.. 1- CONCEPTION AND CREATION everyone knows that one of the most exciting things about villains is there creation, and how they became they way they are, i believe the original batman films which Tim Burton directed handled this brilliantly, but look at Spiderman 2 which has a great villain. There was no flashback even to the creation of the joker character we must believe he has been there all along, as well as Two Face whos original coming of being i liked better in batman forever, not to say i like tommy lee Jones character portrayal any better than this 1.2-VIOLENCE this film had left a bitter taste after viewing i am a fan of violent films but it can be seen the way this was edited to ensure the upper catorgory of a pg-13 12a(uk) over here left the film looking a feeling like something was missing. Instead of showing the conseqeunce of for example a bullet in the head the camera would cut away leaving it for the audience imagination, another example of not showing violence and actually changing the tone of the film was robocop the R rated version when compared against the X rated version which seems lighter in tone.3-BATMAN now Batman played by Bale one of my favourite actors opted for a stupid gruff sounding voice which didn't work, also the suit castes were terrible and i mean truly bad, batmans suit made him look like a more well equipped navy seal or something, not the true mysticism that is batman which is lost in this film. There is no reference to bats whatsoever throughout the duration. Another letdown was the fight sequences which even though Bale did a lot himself did not look smooth, or good on the big screen.4-PLOT/PACINGthe plot has to many twists and turns and leaves some of the less cerebral most likely lost(not myself of course). The pacing is bad as there is one key action sequence in the middle of the film which did blow me away but the film never lived up to that particular sequence which is a shame, less morality and preachyness more ACTION! and on that note a spoiler which i do warn before hand, the ending i must say i disliked a lot, for lack of realism, depth and completion as it is left very much open of what happens to the joker character, my 2 cents please reply if you have maybe a differing opinion to mine, Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest comic book translations to films, as in the earlier batmans, (including returns) but this should never be uttered in the same sentence as a film like the Godfather, which i believe to be one of the greatest of all time, the greatest which i do believe is Once upon A time in America.",0
"The Dark Knight is not a good movie, by any measure. I will now proceed to provide reasons for this statement, in the process of which SPOILERS will abound.In this film Batman (The Batman, as the characters refer to him) possesses superpowers rivaled only by Superman: he bends gun barrels using his bare hand (yes, only one hand) and falls from ridiculous heights, not deploying his cape, and lands without as much as a scratch to his body. The Batman is apparently not aware that it is not the fall that kills you, it is the quick acceleration at the end, and no matter the quality of the Batsuit, that acceleration cannot be reduced.On the other hand, his kevlar Batsuit which, evidently, is impervious to bullets of small hand guns fired at close range, is unable to withstand dog bites.The Joker, whose obvious insanity is the only light of the movie, is well-played by Ledger who flares with his eyes and mouth to give him an almost rabid portrayal, but other than being a dark menace to society, his odd manners and, at one time, drag outfit, provide comedic relief in the film.Apart from being just a regular killing maniac, he also possesses superpowers of his own: in the film, he is depicted with an apparent and sporadic invisibility to police forces. That they do not notice his deformed face without make-up in their own ranks during a salute may be pardonable, but when blowing up an apparently unsurveilled hospital on prior warning and then leaving, in full make-up, in a school bus (his escape vehicle of choice, also from bank raids), his failed apprehension seems unpardonable. Unless, of course, all the cops had their lunch break, as the sun indicates it is around noon.The plot is so thin at times, you expect it to crack at any moment. It is like there are many small plots, in all of which Batman, the purported main character, plays but a small role. Whatever the Joker has been doing all his life, before going on a murder spree, is pardonable to omit, but when he breaks into Bruce Wayne's penthouse (probably using his cloaking capabilities), the same locale that a few scenes later will be referred to as ""the safest place in town"" by the same person who was tossed out a window during this same brief encounter, it is an interesting question just how the maniac and his armed gang are persuaded to leave the party full of Gotham's economic elite, something they must have done without causing much further harm as it goes largely unnoticed by the other characters.Batman speaks with a deathly voice, that is so ghoulish it could scare off any foe, would he just make more use of it against his enemies, and not blather like that to his friends. That he finally tracks the Joker down, is not due to any superior detective skills, as he gets good help from prying on all of Gotham's mobile phones that he immorally and secretly has replaced with his own brand, all in one night's work. More ridiculous plot element is hard to come by.",0
"Nolan and Bale absolutely destroyed Batman. Bale is just too cardboard for this and Nolan should stick with sci-fi strange stuff like Inception or Interstellar. This is not a guy to give Batman to. Ledger was pretty good. Nicholson was still 10 times better. And then the biggest insult to the viewers: Those GIGANTIC plotholes and ridiculous timejumps.No movie with holes like that should get even a 6. And that end fight.... They all stand squared off against each other, guns cocked, and then.....they run towards each other to have a big fist fight. SERIOUSLY? I really wonder where these hordes of schmucks that give this turd a perfect score come from.",0
"I think the hype around this movie makes people completely overrate it. OK Heath does a great job at the joker but the movie itself has many flaws: 1. The balance between good and badguy is all out of sync. Batman fades into the background, he also has way less dialog than the joker. This makes the movie unbalanced. I think they re-cut the movie after Heaths death, to put him in the foreground.2. The movie is tooooo long, this story can be shorter with less redundant scenes, its like they couldn't choose what to put in, so they just put all of it in! This gave me and some of my friends several *yawn* moments near the end.3. Gotham city looks like a normal city. In ""batman begins"" it had a real comic feel but in this movie it doesn't, which is a shame really.4. The point of the movie, (i wont tell u what it is) but yes, this action movie tries to make a philosophical point. Of course this can be great, but in this movie it gets chewed over and over and over and then it gets forced down your throat.5. Lack of humor. An occasional sharp or funny dialog would have been great, however the dialogs arnt very good and they're never funny.6. The plot devices are really quite lame. I wont go into details but most of the plot devices are silly and inspirationless, even the comic manages to feel more realistic than that. Somehow the movie doesn't manage to convince the audience of its own logic, probably cause there is none.All in all its a fun movie, with great performance by Heath as the joker, however it is not the masterpiece people try to turn it into. It doesn't deserve a place in the top 250, and it is not the best movie of 2008. Of course, if you settle for mediocrity this is the movie for you!",0
"""The Dark Knight"" is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I've disliked most of Christopher Nolan's prior work, but was willing to be converted, and the rave reviews psyched me up.Drained of humor (even black), plot less, structurally inept, poorly shot, one-third of the movie coming across as a Pierce Brosnan Bond movie (Bale even goes into Bond autopilot without noticing), Nolan hasn't a clue how to make pictures or what makes humans tick, and I wish the undeserved hype around him as a director ended now. Ledger is dreadful, but the poor chap's role is so wretchedly written that his character never stands a chance. Not to mention Nolan's amateurish decision to make Ledger copy Vincent Price's ""Thriller"" voice, undermining any authority the character is supposed to have. By attempting to ground the Batman mythology in contemporary reality, it just comes across as plain silly. Nolan makes films for technology age emotionless drudges hiding their lack of self-esteem and identity crises behind a mask of hipness and faux-aggression. By going to see ""The Dark Knight"", Nolan is dictating to them that they are cool and superior. That the film is a horrible, poorly made, highly manipulative piece of work, is irrelevant.",0
"For a film to be 10/10, it really has to be almost perfect. I know it's all about opinions, but to get that rating it must be technically well made, you know, entertaining, good plot, special FX, acting, realism, etc. Oh and when I say realism I don't mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy, but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules. For example the Matrix was still realistic even though people could fly (it was set in a computer so it's possible). I liked the fact TDK was serious and dark, but that is where the positives end. The plot is ludicrous, as the Joker, who is a human being, is omnipresent, clairvoyant, a great hypnotist, invincible and has no human needs. I know this is a ""comic book"" movie, but when you set up a film in a normal America city, with normal physics and all that goes with it, you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events.The joker is beaten up, involved in car crashes, doesn't seem to sleep, yet is perfectly fine at all timesHas a vast amount of mindless, kamikaze, henchmen, who inexplicably do everything he says.The joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in Gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once.No one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter. A man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time, somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery.In the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well. You don't care about anyone, as everything is too unrealistic. Therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10/10, almost regardless of opinion. I quite liked the filming and the mood of the film, but it has too many flaws to be considered that good.I gave it a 1/10, which is too harsh, but I felt obligated to bring down the overall rating.",0
"Although suffering from a muddled plot, ill-defined characters, a typically uncharismatic performance by Christian Bale, and a lack of energy, The Dark Knight proved to be on of 2008's greatest commercial and critical successes.The fact that this film is in the Top Ten list tells me two things: 1) Most of the people who rated this highly are either 10-year-olds or adults with the attention span of 10-year-olds. I do not mean to offend all 10-year-olds, because there are some rare exceptions. But, you can catch my drift.2) People who rated this highly have not seen many of the other, better films on this list. They have nothing to compare The Dark Knight to.Anyway, I just hope this film's current standing sinks down far below the 250 mark.",0
"This is the biggest ridicule after George W. not being able to spell the word 'nuclear' right. It is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention. Batman, The Dark Knight is a piece of cake. With capital letters.OK, a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block. But no piece of trash has ever been so over-rated as this one is. I know that Heath Ledger's death came unexpected, and the guy was a solid actor, but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty. 'Cause however hard I am trying I am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give Christopher Nolan's new embarrassment of an action flick six, seven, eight or nine points, let alone ten.This movie is lacking a consequent plot, a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough. Besides, I really don't know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched, but what I see is that Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhal and Gary Oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day - and probably the collection of money - in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen. Oh, and quite often I really got confused; from time to time I needed to be reminded I was not watching the new James Bond movie or Terminator CXXXVIII (the gadget scene, the plane escape scene are truly pathetic, as is the concept of (re)introducing the character of Two-Face, the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven).Since we are talking about a comic book adaptation I don't bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are (try wiring a town hospital with all that security and CCTV cameras they got installed, or try buying - unnoticed - the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky), but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details. Like when police forces storm the Hong Kong building to catch the bat-suit guy: 'Arigato, arigato!'- they wave each other up the stairs. Does this mean China needs to hire law enforcement personnel from Japan? OK, I am stopping there. I know I might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers. This forgettable encounter with Batman however, reminds me again I am not one of them.",0
"This is starting to be downright ludicrous. Another naked king makes it to the top of the charts, helped by massive publicity.This is just another generic action blockbuster, based on tired clichés. It's not different from, say, those old Schwartzenegger movies: it's just updated for current trends and mass appeal: more effects, more speed, more violence, more noise, more music, just more of everything (except the intelligent stuff of course).The whole thing takes itself so seriously, and even pretends to bring some, er.. philosophical insight (sic) to the mix. Yeah, right. You end with a product that is not only mediocre, but aggressively and arrogantly so at that! Yes, Ledger's acting is a treat. And there's even a ~30 sec. good scene halfway through the movie. Er... That's about it.""Overrated'"" doesn't even start describing the irrational hype around this formulaic and forgettable action flick for teenagers.",0
"OK now i was a big fan of Batman Begins, i really liked it but it wasn't really my favourite movie ever and the same can be said for The Dark Knight.First of all, whilst the joker was an interesting character and very well written, to be honest i don't see what everyone is raving about. Yes Heath was amazing, but it gets me thinking was this due to the script? Or heath's ability to understand and become a phycopath? If it really is the second, should we applaud it?Did it live up too all the Hype? Is Heath the only reason people went to see it? Is it the best film of the year? The answer to all these is of course..........no, and i don't understand why everyone is treating it like a god ""omg it was so amazing, best movie of the year"", you see people this type of person is called a ""Hype Hound""(by the way, thats copy written =]), a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film, and the first few reviews. Thats not to say there aren't some true fans who really did love the movie, but I'm sick of the pretenders giving it tens when they didn't even like it ""Conformity is for those who cant think of there own free will, free will is for those who break through conformity""Anyways guys my final words is, a great movie but not the greatest. Will Heath win an Oscar? Yes. Will it win Best Picture? Well lets just see",0
"The protagonist is boring, his Batman voice makes it impossible to take him seriously, he kills two people despite his no-killing rule being a major plot point, the villain makes no sense, the plot is riddled with holes big enough to see from orbit, and the action and editing are objectively terrible, to the point that basic spatial consistency does not exist. But worst of all, the film promotes a clear authoritarian message, with the protagonist indulging in torture, mass surveillance, and openly admitting that lying to the people is a-okay.The only good things about the film are the music and Ledger's entertaining performance.There is no defending this film. Do not even try.",0
"Review of one of the most surprising let downs follows. There are no spoilers, the film spoils itself enough...It's fair to say that prior to this film coming out I had concerns over the use of the Joker in this film. Concerns that only got more pronounced when I'd heard they cast Health Ledger in the role. Then I saw Brokeback Mountain and I became convinced that actually the guy had a raw talent and that maybe, just maybe, he could pull it off. Until the trailer came out and I was immediately concerned again. So how was Heath? Neither good nor bad. He was a live wire, and gleefully unpredictable and a shambolic, almost serpentine presence at points. But it wasn't spectacular. Talks of post-humous Oscar nods though are an exceptional exaggeration and unfortunately I believe this to be motivated by grief for Ledger.Aaron Ekhart's not bad, but I'm not really sure anyone knew why he was really there. I did NOT believe in Harvey Dent. Maggie Gyllenhaal was awful. It is a terrifying thing to say that Katie Holmes was better. You actually have your fingers crossed that someone will kill her right from the start. Morgan Freeman has a couple of nice moments but despite being given more screen time he contributes very little. Same with Gary Oldman. Seriously - what happened? Even Christian Bale seems to have lost a sense of what he's doing, Batman's voice getting ever closer to sounding like Rod Stewart's singing voice that at times I couldn't take it seriously, assuming you can make out what he's saying at all! It's difficult to comprehend that the same cast is in this film and Batman Begins, they really don't stack up side by side at all. Everone feels wasted.The Dark Knight is over long, it takes forever to really get any momentum going and then at the point you think it's starting it fails to launch. There are set pieces that don't really hang together and if you think about any of them for too long (which you will, as it does tend to drag) you'll find that they don't all make sense. One of the things that made Batman Begins so strong was a sense of realism - even going to great lengths to try to rationalize the ridiculous (a man dressed as a bat....). Tragically, The Dark Knight seems to have forgotten this entirely. Yes the Joker is larger than life but does that explain the obviously CGI enhanced stupid moments such as the Bat Pod cycling up a wall to flip over? There are too many of these moments - turning every cell phone into a sonar transponder in order to trace the Joker. Um? What? Also EVERYONE felt very written. Everyone's dialogue seemed to be furthering the plot rather than sounding like anything approaching reality. Michael Cain turns into Aunt May giving twee and convenient platitudes and nothing else - there's no sense of connection between him and anyone else. Gyllenhaal - even managing to leave twee and convenient letters to be read at twee and convenient moments. Aaron Ekhart seems to basically behave like a character bio rather than feeling terribly real and the whole descent into Two-Face thing STILL doesn't work.If you loved Batman Begins (and I did) you won't love this I'm afraid. You may not hate it, but I don't think you'll be impressed. I hope to watch this again at some point when the let down has passed me by and I'll hopefully enjoy it a bit more. There are three recent films I've been to see I had low expectations for - Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and The Dark Knight. The first two surprised me and exceeded my expectations. The latter has left me feeling a bit flat. I'm just very disappointed, Batman Begins set a very high mark. The Dark Knight by comparison is almost worth avoiding.",0
"I saw this movie on a Monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater. Good plan. It worked. The movie didn't. Many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so I'll skip that part. There were some very good, though isolated, moments in the story: a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesn't work, the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived, ""abridged"" civil rights are neither civil nor right, etc. I like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state.To me, however, the most prominent feature of this film was neither Heath Ledger, (whom I greatly respect as an actor), Christian Bale, nor the script, directing, story line, performances, or suspense, but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on. Everything in this movie explodes!!! And the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing, stabbing, pounding, bludgeoning, shooting, and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through. And though I have enormous respect for him, Ledger's Joker was basically Ted Bundy with face paint. I think the inspiration for this film came more from Oliver Stone's ""Natuarl Born Killers"" than from anything that was ever written in a comic book.All you need to know is this... In the last ten minutes of the film, with the body count hovering somewhere around 100, a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood, (those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about). The scene goes on for what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, but even as it was just beginning I was thinking to myself, ""no, no, no, this is wrong. This should not be done this way in a movie"". Then somewhere in the theater, behind me, a child began sobbing uncontrollably. Yes, real terror, real horror, real fear, a real child, right there in the theater. The scene finally came to an end. The sobbing didn't. As the lights came up for us to leave I saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater, still sobbing, and hanging on to his parents' clothing as they walked out.I don't blame the parents. This movie's PG13 rating is unconscionable. This is a ""Batman"" movie! With a PG13 rating! ""Batman"" originated from a children's comic book series. One would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children. It's not. Given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits it's not even suitable for adults. Several of the postings here at IMDb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film ever,according to IMDb. Not me. I really didn't like this movie. And in the last ten minutes of it I came to hate it. It does not do service to the Batman franchise, or movies in general. There is not a shred of ""comic book"" appeal in it anywhere, and it will take it's place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made. That this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad, and sick inside. And if I could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest I'd say this, ""thanks for the memories"".",0
"This movie is not even a Batman movie. It's basically a Joker movie featuring Batman because that's what everyone remembers.
The irony is that Batman Begins is miles ahead of TDK, yet it's rated lower than even TDKR.The movie itself is watchable only because Heath Ledger gives an exceptional performance, but looking beyond his performance, the movie is very awful.
There are more plot holes in TDK than the entire DCEU put together, including Green Lantern. Usually, in this kind of situation where it's a comic book movie, you tend to let some things slide, however, when Nolan publicized his trilogy as being realistic (where he failed miserably), you end up cringing most of the time.The problem with TDK is there are too many inconsistencies smothered in incoherence... The fact that people (and critics) are usually very critical on everything, but did not notice all these plot holes in the movie and dubbed it ""the best comic book movie ever and one of the best movies ever made"". TDK, if you actually watch the movie, is not even top 10 material in its own genre, let alone being top 5 all time.The legion of Batmanites made this rating high, but it does not reflect the actual merit it deserved. It was a complete piece of crap, plain and simple. No character development, abundance of plot holes and a week story... How can people be so blind?",0
"I don't want to waste more time on writing the review for this stupid movie, as I have already wasted my precious time watching it! This movies is over-hyped. c'on, IMDb gives it 9.2?? I mean are you serious?? lol........really this is the biggest joke ever, that an awful movie like this gets 9.2??!!! Direction is mediocre. The 'hissing' voice of batman is annoying. It was supposed to sound intimidating and macho, but it sounds as if he is having laryngitis, instead.Joker?? Was he really the joker (who never laughs??). A joker is a character, who is supposed to be full of surprises and tricks, and most important the one who 'laughs' in paradoxical situations. Unfortunately, this joker was not even close to the actual joker character.It seems, as if joker controls the whole city, but how and when, God knows? I can't go without mentioning that 'hyper sonar' machine, that can see every single person in the city. This time the director really jumped out of his briefs!! You evacuate all the hospitals in the city, except for the person for whom you are doing the evacuation!! lol........who was the writer?? I guess he didn't reach school higher than 2nd grade.I have so much to say about this stupid movie, but again, as I have already promised that even reviewing this stupid movie is wastage of time, so in the end, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, which paradoxically gets the best rating.",0
"My comments refer only to the 2008 USA release, aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 widescreen version (not the IMAX aspect ration 1.44 : 1, which could potentially be better)Sorry but the movie was AWFUL, Not worth the money! Special effects aside, gadgets, and the Batmobile which is a dream automobile, the movie runs 152 minutes too long, unnecessary ending, but most importantly does not have any resemblance to the original Batman series or the comic books, neither in character, nor intent.Best of the movie is the director Christopher Nolan,his attention to detail and superb sequences,i.e: bus braking out of the bank, the capture and return of Lau (Chin Han), the explosion, and the capture of the Joker (Heath Ledger). The characters are very intense, especially The Joker, Bruce Wayne/Batman, & Harvey Dent/Two-Face. The best and worst of the actors, I'll start with the worse. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both accomplished actors they are probably two of the finest alive, Sir Caine was the worst of the supporting characters, neither of the two were convincing, they failed in their craft both were consistently bad actors in this film. The best was Heath Ledger hands down, his performance was top-notch, consistent, but above all spectacular. There will be a sequel to Batman: The Dark Knight which sincerely hope will be better.",0
"I may run out of words to end with ""less"". Mindless, witless, a view of the world that's hopeless. Horrible acting, writing, editing, lighting and music. I've seen it all before only done better. Nicholson's turn at Joker was far, far superior. Ledger? Mirthless, just a distracting concoction of tics. Bale? Who knows? His augmented voice and masked face made his 2-dimensional performance meaningless. Dent? What a horrible performance, something you'd see on ""Knot's Landing"". Where have we come as a society? Kubrick made ""A Clockwork Orange"" in '71, a devilishly clever, mean and stylish film that pushed the limits when it came to on-screen violence. His young monster, Alex, played by the brilliant Malcolm MacDowell, was a thing to behold. Now we have families taking their kids to the '08 version of ultraviolence and yukking it up. The dark night of America film-making is more like it. Are we really this numb, are we really this nihilistic?",0
"I finally saw this movie because everyone kept talking about it. But for anyone who has seen more than a few movies (ie somebody over 20) there is just nothing there. Even without the hype I found this movie to be really painfully bad. A few points:---It seems the movie is trying to be realistic starting with something that looks like a somewhat believable heist. But then there are so many totally improbable things like batman's hideout and gadgets, the joker somehow getting zillions of minions, etc. So which is it a gritty crime movie or fantasy? I can't tell.---Haven't we seen ""witty"" dialog like this 100 times:Batman: ""Let her go"" Joker: ""Oh, very poor choice of words"" (drops her out window)When this happened my jaw dropped. This is worse than a Rambo movie.---I get it that Heath Ledger playing The Joker is supposed to be some crazy psycho. Hardly original or award worthy. Just looked like a hundred others we have seen before in other movies.---All ""characters"" are totally off-the-shelf. There's no depth or surprise to them at all. ---What does Rachel Dawes see in Bruce Wayne? In the scene in the restaurant (""I own the place"") he seems like a braggart and feels the need to arrive at his own party in a helicopter with three arm candy women on his arm. (Why isn't he already at his own place?)---Oh look a fancy party in Wayne's penthouse. I wonder what's going to happen? Look the bad guy comes in a starts tormenting people. Then Wayne has to change into his batman costume to save the day. How is this not 110% predictable.---Again, is the movie supposed to be realist? When arrested The Joker would really be forced to wash the makeup off his face.---Bruce Wayne saves the armored truck from a collision by placing his Lamborghini in between it an on coming truck. Aren't armored trucks stronger than sports cars. Yeah, I know Wayne has some magic tech. So at this point we are supposed to suspend disbelief.---I could go on. Obviously some people really like this movie. That's great but please don't say its anything like the best movie ever until you have seen some films from the AFI's lists http://www.afi.com/10TOP10/",0
"I wasn't so much excited about ""Batman Begins"". Simply pseudo-intellectual ""philosophy of fear"" was rather painful than interesting to me. Techno-futuristic Batman surrounded by oh-my-god cinema stars that have nothing to do with traditional Batman characters was nothing special to me. But this time I got excited. 3rd trailer was absolutely great, interesting interpretation of Joker (though vocally not so good as Mark Hamill but very original), a little bit of darkness, ""The Dark Knight"" reminding me of ""The Dark Knight Returns"" (that then I found out has absolutely nothing to do with the movie). It was great. But then... then come the movie... Movie that is absolutely boring, artistic-like weird and is so full of light that calling it ""dark"" is an abomination. If you want to hear the voice of Batman who apparently sings in a death metal band, go for this movie. If you want to see Gotham probably built and designed by IKEA (especially interiors), go! If you want to see ""bat cave"" so full of light that I had to dive under my chair to bring my eyes some darkness, it's the movie for you. But if you want to see anything really dark, atmospheric, Gothic, simply batman-like better remind yourself of things like ""Batman The Animated Series"" (1992) or Burton's movies (1989 & 1992) as you will find a lot of what Batman really is there, the real Dark Knight where word Dark means something and Knight is not meaningless as well. ""The Dark Knight"" is absolutely soulless like IKEA furniture and even Heath Ledger do not save the movie as his Joker is enjoyable for first 40 minutes, then becomes simply boring and all the same. What's funny, myself and audience around laughed much more when Batman spoke with his ""dark"" voice (death metal band vocalist, here...we...go!) than Joker laughed through the whole movie. It doesn't surprise me much as Ledger had the biggest problem with learning the mad laughter and although he did pretty well, lack of it during the movie, lack of single smile on Joker's face made it all look very pathetic. And then, here...we...go... with the plot. Batman decided to give up twice in the movie. Of course because he was afraid of what people think and self-critique. He apparently forgot that he started his obsession thanks to his parents death (oh well...). Alfred is dull and absolutely boring (I start to believe that it's just good to have ""Michael Caine"" name on movie posters). Lucius Fox is ohmygod-another-star-to-have-bigger-commercial-impact. Gordon was and remains not even close to what Gordon suppose to be, in my opinion. Etc. Etc. Finishing this counting-out rhyme with the Batman himself. Personally I love the way Ch.Bale acts. I admire his role in Prestige very much. But here... I don't see Batman, all I see is Christian Bale pretending he is Batman. Sad :(My conclusion is simple, Nolan's vision is far from what I consider as ""the dark knight"" and lack of darkness, lack of dark Gotham (not to mention that Gotham lacking of criminals who are too afraid to do their job instead of overwhelming Batman with number of crimes is simply a blasphemy), lack of darkness in Batman's soul and then lack of taste and common sense in the movie are something that made me yawn and look on my watch for nearly whole movie. Apparently audience thought the same as nearly every Batman's line produced fine amounts of laughter and maybe 10 people stayed to see first lines of credits (just like they would hear ""here...we...go..."" and decided to evacuate as fast as possible, literally).I know that the future will be completely different but I have high hope that Nolan will never, ever do another ""Batman"" again. Please... for the dark knight's sake.",0
"8.9 out of 10_really? The Dark Knight is undeniably visually impressive, full of flashy special effects, stunning production design and spectacular action set-pieces, but the fans who have rated this film so highly clearly have as little grip on reality as its antagonist The Joker (Heath Ledger).152 minutes of relentlessly dark, dreary, depressing drama_the enjoyment factor turned down to the lowest possible setting_this overly complex and frequently logic-free sequel to Batman Begins sees director Christopher Nolan once again presenting the antics of a man dressed as a bat in a completely humourless fashion. And if Nolan is going to take matters so seriously, then so am I...Could a man with half his face burned off really get out of bed the next day to conduct a vendetta? Why does Batman talk to Fox in his 'gruff' voice when the man already knows his real identity? How do you get hundreds of barrels of explosives onto two ferries without being noticed? Likewise, how did The Joker wire up a hospital to blow-up without being spotted? Who built Batman's underground silo? Does anyone really know what the hell was going on during that scene with that cell phone sonar equipment and the building full of baddies? Where exactly do you hire a butler who can arrange for a skyhook in Hong Kong? These are just a few of the many questions that arise from Nolan's so-called masterpiece.Rabid Batman/Nolan fans might be all too happy to overlook these somewhat awkward posers, but I can't_not when such a blatantly flawed film currently sits at No.8 in the IMDb top 250.5.5 out of 10, but not good enough to be rounded up to a 6.",0
"I hated this movie. The editing was awful. There were times I didn't know what was going on like they cut out a part of the movie and I was left guessing. It was WAY to long. Batman couldn't breathe through most of the movie or was that an attempt at acting and seeming ""dark"". I felt like he should pull out an inhaler- what a joke this flick was. Are we that stupid that this many people loved this movie? Oh and let me not forget the 100 flips of the two headed coin- boy that got old quick. The ONLY thing that saved this movie for me was the Joker. Cut out everything else and run clips of all the jokers scenes and I would happily pay almost twenty bucks to see it oh and anything Morgan Freeman does is all right by me- otherwise GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!",0
"I actually agree with almost every comment in the ""Hated It"" category. This was an enormously over-hyped and overblown flick - but apparently the explosion-and-violent-chase fans are rating as one of the greatest movies ever, despite a collection of plot holes that resembles the face of a tennis racket. I can understand their enthusiasm, but what was going through the minds of the professional reviewers??? I've seen them pick apart unto death much better flicks than this. Their bitch meters should have gone straight to the infrared, but instead they turned into pompon-wavers. Were they paid off? I have one extra comment on the plot. When the Joker is in police custody, one of the first things they would have done was wipe off all the clown makeup. Without it, this guy becomes a nothing - Samson without his hair. Then they just bury him in some out-of-state max security pen (and label him a child molester, by way of revenge), and all Gotham's troubles go back to same-old same-old. SSDD.Unlike most, I saw this movie first on DVD. It damn near drove me crazy: if I could get my hands around the neck of the Sound Director, he'd be dead meat. The explosions and demolition-derby car chases like to blow out the speakers on my TV - and then half the dialog is done at a virtual whisper! I practically wore out the volume buttons on my remote: up and down, up and down, ad infinitum. You want to sit back and just enjoy a movie, not have to continually stop it and go back because muting down the explosions caused you to miss the first five sentences of dialog. I dropped my vote three places just for this alone. It was THAT infuriating.As for the Oscars, Ledger's award HAD to be a sympathy vote. If he hadn't committed suicide (nobody can take that many different drugs accidentally), would he have even been nominated? His acting was pretty much just Jack Nicholson's Joker on angel dust. (Art imitating life???) Of course, the Academy keeps throwing statuettes at Nicholson, when in every role he's played he just played Jack Nicholson. He's got THAT character down pat.",0
"Like many a thing, keeping it simple is one way to make it good. As much as I loved Batman Begins, I disliked The dark Knight. The movie wanted to cram so many sub-plots into it that at some time I didn't know exactly where it was going. And is this movie really about Batman??? If it was, there are some features in it that made it look like a CHEAP Batman:1. OK, Wayne's manor was destroyed, blah blah. But making Batman roar out of a CONTAINER??? Can we make this any cheaper? An underground lair for Batman that seems to contain NOTHING but a table and a chair and a few other stuff???? Production could have made a little effort there, really... 2. Batman's costume, frankly didn't look THAT better than the Batman wanna-bes.And what's that fuss about dogs? Batman's costume isn't dog proof. It's bullet proof, fire-proof, shock-proof and nearly stupid-proof but please don't unleash the dogs on poor Batman... pathetic, really.The movie in itself does not lack action and blow-away special effects, but the storyline really lacks of substance. We see Batman in a supporting role, to do what others ask him to do, we don't see Batman as the leader and coming up with unexpected plans and twists - U gotta bring back the Chinese guy, OK I'll go. -U gotta save the hostages, I'll go. U gotta do this, do that? I'll go. Anything else? Tea or Coffee anyone?Not the best movie, at any cost. Not of the year nor of any time, sorry...",0
"I just rented this from Netflix and forced myself to watch it till the end. What a dreadful, boring yet expensive movie. It was so dimly lit, they could have had any of the thousands of out-of-work actors in Southern California in it with no perceptible difference. I guess a couple more explosions would have helped (not really). I only watched it cause of Heath Ledger's excellent performance in Brokeback Mountain. Boy, was I disappointed. I didn't care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end. At times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture.I just don't get what passes for great entertainment nowadays. I had to watch some old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance, an odd combination. It's like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial. Don't bother.",0
"Although an average film, ""Batman Begins"" had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolan's dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make ""Batman Ends.""",0
"Before walking into this movie , i really had great expectations, what with the rave reviews the movie was being lavished with and the seemingly awesome trailer. And then came the moment of truth,the movie was very ordinary. I saw nothing special in this movie for me to even remotely praise it. It was long, many gaps in the plot in addition to scenes and story lines which seemed senseless and had no follow -up. Plus, there really was nothing artistic about it and it didn't actually have the enjoyable cinematic experience moviegoers would want to relish in. This was further aggravated with the poor lines in the film. In short the movie didn't get me all excited or sucked me into it. Throughout the entire film I was hardly able to connect to the film. That said however I wouldn't recommend folks to not watch it but just an advice to keep your hopes to a minimal point.",0
"I was not expecting this film to live up to the hype, but it didn't even come close to living up to my lowered expectations. I give it 3 stars only for Heath Ledger's performance, which was very original and nicely done, but still not deserving of the rave reviews it has been receiving. Even his excellent performance was brought down by the horrible script he had to work with.It's all been said before, but:The acting of every cast member except for Heith Ledger was wooden and utterly boring.The Batman character was unsympathetic and had none of the appeal that was built up in ""Batman Begins"" of a tormented soul nonetheless trying to do good. In this film he is both boring, nasty, and indecisive.Every fight scene was mechanical, unoriginal, shot in dim lighting, and used none of the stealth that Batman is supposed to use.Batman's voice was laughable and got worse as the film dragged on.Way too many convoluted and disconnected subplots to keep track of. I had no idea where the story was going at any point in time, and didn't care. I watched this on DVD and started fast-forwarding through large chunks about 2 hours into the movie; should have done this sooner.Every character spouted sophomoric monologues about good and evil that were unconvincing. A good script gets these messages across using the plot and actions of the characters, not through monologues.The Joker's various schemes and escapes were impossible to believe even in the context of a comic good movie. How could the Joker walk into a hospital, with full makeup on, and walk right up to Harvey Dent, who is unguarded, *after* the Joker has already kidnapped and disfigured Dent once, *and* the Joker has announced he is going to attack a hospital? This kind of thing happened countless times. I love comic book movies (e.g., Xmen 1 & 2, Iron Man), but in the good ones you can believe that the events would actually happen within the context of the fantasy world of the story.The love triangle story felt tacked-on. What in the story showed you that Bruce Wayne and Rachel, or Harvey Dent and Rachel, had any affection for each other? You are just supposed to accept all of this without any effort by the scriptwriters or actors.The Joker has an endless crew of henchmen, but why would any criminal agree to work for the Joker after he assassinates his entire crew in the first scene? Why would any criminal agree to work for him if his goal is just to cause chaos and not to earn money, and he burns all the money he earns? Don't criminals normally want to get money out of risking their lives to commit crimes?Two and a half hours is way too long. An hour could have been cut without missing it. Compare this to any truly great movie (Gandhi, Godfather 1 & 2), where several hours just fly by.The scriptwriters couldn't decide whether to make this a ""realistic"" drama or a comic book for the screen. So they flip-flopped back and forth. Case in point: a witness on the stand pulls out a gun, Harvey Dent disarms him, and then wants to continue examining the witness. This is slapstick and is impossible to swallow if we are supposed to believe this is the ""real world,"" but it could work if the whole movie set a ""comic book"" tone in which ridiculous things like this happen. But it didn't, so the inconsistencies are just jarring. At least the Tim Burton films -- and even the campy 1960s Batman TV show! -- created an internally consistent world.I was ready for the movie to be over, when in comes a whole separate story about Two Face. It was completely out of place with whatever plot arc still existed at that point. Plus, the transformation of Harvey Dent's character into Two Face made no sense, as did his ability to survive a car-flipping accident. Then we witness him shoot Batman, who we have already seen surviving hundreds of bullets without a scratch, and we are supposed to be surprised when Batman leaps up again, unharmed?I could write another whole review just listing more plot holes.Again, I am a big fan of comic book movies and even enjoyed Batman Begins, but this was a real loser.",0
"This is a great movie to watch when you're completely drunk and likely to miss the following things:1) An aimless doddering plot full of obvious contrivances. 2) Numerous and massive implausibilities, (even given the comic-book setting).3) Endless philosophical blather that is about as deep as a sidewalk puddle ? typical of the superficial drivel flowing out of Hollywood these days. I believe it was written by Paris Hilton.4) A 3+ hour movie that should have been edited to an hour and a half.Ledger put in a decent performance, and Morgan Freeman is always professional.But even the action, which can be a saving grace for a fun ""brain-off"" adventure flick, was full of visual flaws.Yawwwwn.",0
"A below average film which went on far too long. Heath Ledger didn't completely fail at portraying The Joker, but to compare him with Nicholson and favor him is insulting to both their careers. He's essentially just playing a rather generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker and can't really dazzle anymore after a scene or four. Christian Bale is like a fossilized chunk of wood in his role as Bruce Wayne and as (the) Batman just seemed to be in the wrong movie and desperately in need of some antibiotics.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were fortunately able to add credibility to it all and when they appeared on screen, the movie was actually pretty great. Pity though that they only got about 1 % of the movie's screen time. Aaron Eckhardt was given nada to work with and was equally wasted. But who can really be surprised watching a movie like this. Just too many inane plot turns which just pulls you further and further away from wanting to find out where it all was heading. I Walked out after the 100 minute mark to get a smoke and just couldn't bother to walk back into the theater.The evening was saved approaching a charming girl at the cinema bar serving ridiculously overpriced, yet abhorrently tasting cocktails. We ended up at her place and we danced to K&D until the first rays of morning sunlight found their way through the ragged drapes covering a cracked windowpane. As she peeled of my clothes as if I was an overripe tangerine, she whispered softly in my ear a mantra of passion.Film: 1/**** Night: 4/****",0
"I just watched ""The Dark Knight"" and I really am shocked that people who vote on this site can possibly say that this film is on the same scale as ""The Godfather"", better than films like ""Ben- Hur"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and pretty much every film made since talkies started in 1927. I mean everyone who could possibly rate this film so high has to be born after 1990. I mean I'm 38, have seen and own over six hundred films, and to me this was an overlong over-hyped film to the max. Being a video/film editor I thought the editing was appalling. The acting, well it wasn't bad I mean Heath Ledger was good in his role his acting was tremendous. His character, however has no background, all we know is that either he or his father gave him scars. Bale's Batman which was great in the first film, doesn't know whether to hang it up, be a hero, or become a hunted animal. The rest of the cast well, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman can never do wrong, but in this film they are really just used for show. Gary Oldman, one of the best actors working today who is generally a chameleon when it comes to characterization, doesn't even bother to try to cover his English accent. Eckhart's Dent was just plain annoying until he becomes Two-Face, and that's almost 2 hours into the film. I was just disappointed, the first film blew this away.",0
"And thus it has been watched; one of the most talked about movies of latter years. The crowning achievement of Nolas career and the apex of Heath ledgers movie history. So is it worth the praise? Does it live up to the expectations set? In short, no. In long: Noooooooooooooooo. The Dark Knight should, at heart, be about Batman and his eternal nemesis the Joker. But Nolans uneven film-making assures this is not the case; The movie has more subplots than three full seasons of ""Days of our Lives""; and most of the subplots feels as relevant as that show. To put it simply: This movie tried to put too much into too short a time. To move on to more specific details: The story has enough plot holes to sink Titanic; How does the Joker finance his operations when he seems unwilling to use cash? How does he get an army of loons to work as a cohesive and highly fanatical religious unit? How does he smuggle vast amounts of explosives onto two boats and one hospital? Another weak point is bad acting and just stupid plot movement; Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne, he is however horrible as Batman. His completely hilarious attempt at distorting his voice sounds like a severe case of throat cancer. It is of little consequence however as he's delegated to the role of sidekick anyway. The actor who played Harvey Dent is in the long run pointless; He is of TV-quality and can't handle his role .Then again, he does it better than Tommy Lee Jones did. Gary Oldman has something of a broken look over him; he seems to wish out of the movie as soon as possible. Michael Caine as Alfred isn't that good compared to the old Alfred, but he suffices. Morgan Freeman does what he does best; Speaks with an authoritative voice.And now..To the name of the movie: Heath Ledger, who's untimely death has elevated him to the sort of cult status only death celebrities gets. WHich is unfortunate for while he was a good actor his role here is NOT that good. His version of the Joker is decent, but looses itself in some sort of misguided attempt at realism. In the end the only thing it manages to come across as is boring. The Joker is realistic, and yet gifted with overwhelming superpowers which allows him to do pretty much everything he sets his mind too. And I mean anything; Build up a criminal empire strictly on IOU notes? Check. Smuggle several tons of explosives into what one can be assumed is heavily guarded ferries? Check. Do the same to a major hospital? Check. Convince the man who's wife to be he just murdered brutally that he isn't responsible because he's just ""A dog""? Check. Damnit, this guy could probably convince Batman that he really does have feelings for Robin.Overall TDK is a uneven movie: It is hampered by poor acting, lousy effects and a horrible script. But it has some bright spots in mood and overall theme. In the end, it isn't enough and I cannot for the life of me understand why this movies is hailed as the second coming of Christ.",0
"Man, I had expectations for this one. The greatest movie of all time?! Not really. Not even the best movie in the Batman series actually.The Dark Knight is by no means a bad film. In fact, it starts off really good. The filmmakers are very successful in how they depict the Joker. Good acting and serious crimes will make it easy to hate the villain this time.But from the top, it is a long way down. The storyline isn't smooth enough to make it interesting. Fairly good acting throughout only partially helps to compensate for the many flaws. What unfolds lacks credibility to such an extent that it does not help that Batman is a fictional character. There seems to be no limit to what the Joker can do, and there must be an endless supply of criminals willing to help him. Half of the police force is corrupt, and at times it all seems like one big quarrel. Since no one can be trusted anyway, let's shoot in every direction and blow up some buildings!But there are definitely some ups along the way. A few scenes shot in Hong Kong are just excellent. The big budget is apparent - nothing looks fake. Explosions and destruction look like real, and I heard that most of it actually is.Some high tech stuff lacks credibility so much that you will laugh. Distibuted cellphone based sonars? Not really :) The Dark knight fails to surpass Batman Begins, which is better in almost every aspect, except for maybe the CGI/special effects.I give Batman Begins a 7/10 and The Dark Knight does not deserve more than 5/10.",0
"I am really astonished reading all the commentaries and the incredible average mark of the film. This movie is simply deceiving.When I first saw Batman Begins, I really loved it. From then I began to investigate more about Christohper Nolan and his films. I discovered also that Memento was directed by him, as well as Insomnia with Al Pacino and Robin Williams, highly interesting thriller placed in Alaska.Back to ""Knight"", I found it firstly too long. I went with 3 friends and all of them slept the whole last hour.Secondly, and probably the most important from my point of view, the plot is not surprising and of a quality you wouldn't expect from such an expensive movie.More, Christian Bale is not the same. In that film Batman as well as Bruce Wayne are poor, somehow sad, definitely not inspiring. Nothing comparable to his performance in Psycho. All the action scenes are the same, batman knocking and slamming with its legs, arms and fists. Where is the intelligence and slyness? The highly praised Heath Ledger is not bad, but the character, this new Jocker is deceiving again. Not fun, not subtle nor ironic, simply violent.To finish with, this film is too long, unnecessarily complicated, and if you see the images of the trailer, you have seen it all.",0
"It starts with a pretty good story line, and good characters, Batman, the mob, the joker, and the attorney are all OK. There are great actions scenes, the kidnapping ""over the air"" in Hong Kong is really cool. But after the half of the movie, it turns down: the attorney's girl friend gets killed, OK, and he gets crazy, after 20 years fighting crime, he doesn'st know about casualties? in front of the gangster, he shoots his driver: non-sense! he kidnappes the most honest cop's family: non-sense! voting for survival in the boats : total non-sense! and what do excellent actors like Oldman, Caine, Freeman in such a waste ? Sorry, i'd like my money back..",0
"Anyway, I finally got round to seeing The Dark Knight and, given the overwhelming and fanatical praise the movie has engendered, a rather negative critical evaluation which pours cold water on the mass hysteria seems a bit pointless. Because what do I know? But here goes anyway!So let's confine ourselves to a couple of observations that might give the adoring fans some food for thought.The plot, whilst completely linear, and in fact, rather banal, was confusingly laid out, and not because Nolan was trying for anything enigmatic or even thought provoking; simply it was a tale not very well told. Muddying up a plot, especially one so basic, is not the mark of a clever movie, simply a poor one.The fight scenes were likewise confused and consequently rather uninvolving. And somebody must have been on a bonus to see how many shots of the back end of the ""Batcycle"" could be included in the final cut.POSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENTPOSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENTBut the real surprise for me was the misuse - and I think it is misuse, however deliberately it was conceived - of the central character of Batman.Batman was essentially a bystander in his own movie. He didn't really seem to do anything, other than swan off to Hong Kong, a sub plot that seemed to be taken from a another movie altogether.Harvey Dent was the protagonist of this film and The Joker the antagonist.Batman was seemingly cast adrift, totally peripheral and rather ineffective. It seemed to me that everyone's destiny was settled without much help from Batman, and even the Joker achieved pretty much what he wanted to do.I'd almost go as far to say that if the movie had done away with Batman and had been rewritten as a straight crime procedural, it would have been a better movie. Now Nolan and his buddies obviously know what they wanted to achieve, which is fair enough. I am just surprised with the impression I was left with.Still as I said at the beginning, I am really the wrong person to critique this film. I was cajoled into going and I thought, well it will probably be OK. And, being kind, that is just about what it was.",0
"Ill give The Dark Knight 1 out of 10 stars, just so that its rating on the website will go down, because it doesn't deserve to be anywhere on the top 250 list.Its incredible that heath ledgers acting carried the entire movie on its feet while the rest of the cast tries to entertain us with mediocre acting, plain action scenes, bad screen writing, and the worst batman of all the movies, Christian bail with all his terrible speech impediments! I wouldn't think twice to consider this a 'film.' The original Tim Burton version is a film. it's sequel is a film. but christopher nolan puts a horrid scratch in the line of movies. The dark knight with its mediocre plot, character development, story, acting (exception of course for heath ledger) just makes for a not so epic 'movie' only worthy of a 6 out of 10 rating.The Dark Knight sucks! You don't understand film if you think this mess is an exceptional piece of cinema.And i hope that Daniel day lewis will turn down the joker roll for the next movie. they're getting the best actor possible to play the joker, hoping that he'll do the same as heath did, score 500 million in the box office.RIP Heath",0
"I don't care about the acting or the effects or whatever. Not matter how ... brilliant... uh-huh...Dark Knight is just so completely devoid of any compassion from anyone; it's like watching computer euthenasia. There isn't an ounce of anything equating to a human emotion here. I wasn't afraid. I wasn't entertained. I was just depressed.If this is the best film of 2008 then films have become a way to feed the worse of the human spirit.Ooh, but it exciting, and ooh isn't the Joker a real baddie.When you leave a film just plain bemused at how so many people can buy into this, I for one was definitely not entertained.If you love this then wow yippee....To me it's just ugliness, and really horrible vision of a world where the terrorists always win.And if you find that great entertainment, then what will top this, what more do you want next time? Sorry, just found it all thoroughly horrible. Really.",0
"The worst film i have seen this year. Its so Boring. I think it got good reviews because heath ledger died and that was a tribute to him. Batman is crap, the joker is average. The first Batman with Jack Nicholas as the joker is 1000 times better, that was excellent, this was dire and boring. Beware, batman fans are just going over the top for this heap of rubbish. The film is so predictable because you know what happens. I think that gadgets were not that good and the actors were not that good. I was expecting this to be great but as with all films with far too much hype i was waiting for the good bit. After an hour i was still waiting. After 2 i thought this is so dull and it wasn't going anywhere. I love good films eg Iron Man, Lord Of Rings, Indianna Jones, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars. This is a classic by no means.",0
OK first of all i happen to be a real superhero fan hell you should see the space used here to store all my comics so i usually don't have high demands for a superhero movie i like em all at least until i went to see dark knight that is i went expecting a superhero movie instead i got violence violence some more violence and to top it off some violence at some point i actually started to check watch hoping it would be over soon this movie didn't need a batman the way it played it reminded me off those old B-movies you know the good guy gets ticked off and goes after the bad guys bad guys are usually crazy pure violent guys and you end up with 90 minutes of killing shooting and so on this is basically how the movie went first you have the joker who wants chaos and destruction thats is the entire story about the joker no debt in the entire character that is his only motivation and you never get to know why so the movie starts with the joker fighting everyone batman the Mafia you name it this goes on and on and on when you finally think the movie is over and batman won it starts all over again then they add two-face the only believable char in the entire movie but he plays like 5 minutes overall i went in with high hopes after 30 minutes i hoped the story would get started after 90 minutes i was checking watch hoping it would be over soon i think movies like that should have an LBO warning (Leave Brain Outside) when i noticed the score this movie got i felt actually depressed and i really hope someone boosted this score by cheating the alternative is so horrible i can't even describe it so i keep on trying to convince myself the world is not as bad as that score tells me it is,0
"I'm so relieved that I'm not the only one who doesn't think this movie is great. I saw this first in the theater, and to be honest, probably would've given it a bit higher rating...if I would've reviewed it then. But........I just watched it again on cable and it doesn't hold up as well outside of the movie theater with it's huge screen, dark room and loud speakers. First off...what I liked. Heath Leadger was fantastic as the Joker and could've done so much more with it if the writing and plot had been better. The movie should've focused on a battle of wits and balls between Batman and Joker. That would've been more interesting. I liked Morgan Freeman. I enjoy his character. I like that there wasn't some big distracting relationship for Batman/Bruce. I even enjoyed some of the explosions. I hate Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce. He just doesn't emote anything. Also...HE HAS THE WORST BATMAN VOICE EVER....EVER....EVER!!!! The movie was way too long and had way too many subplots going. I could've lived without the whole Harvey Dent thing. Why introduce Two Face just to kill him off? It made no sense. Then again, a lot of the subplots made no sense. The movie takes itself too seriously. There's really no humor either. I realize the whole idea was to make it dark, but sheesh, c'mon. There were too many just shoved in there explosions going on. It felt like two movies being rammed into one. It's just too much. Too many things going on that don't really gel together. I guess I'm tired of movies that offer more in explosions and chases than solid story telling and characters you can give a damn about. I honestly could not sit through this movie again. If I do anything, I'll watch it free on demand and fast forward to the Heath Leadger scenes. He did so much with what he was given to work with.....which wasn't any where near what it could have been. All in all...this movie doesn't live up to the hype.",0
"I've felt moved to comment on this movie if only to provide some much needed balance to the string of 10 out of 10s being awarded. My real rating would be about 7/10 but I can't stand seeing this up at number 4 on the top 250 list , it wouldn't make my top 100! The plot was confusing and ludicrous throughout.The 'moral dilemma' of the two ferries at the end really spoilt the movie for me. Why weren't the passengers diving off the boats and swimming for it ? would both boats (especially one full of ex-cons) really have taken the morally high decision to choose death to save the others ? Some great scenes, special effects, cinematography, lighting, dark mood etc. Brilliant performance by Heath Ledger but overall the plot let this film down.",0
"Why did I watch this movie? To observe the performance of the late Heath Ledger. It was not a disappointment but, like other reviewers, I think it was not one in a league with, say, John Huston in ""Chinatown"" or Bogart in ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"". It was more akin to Edward G. Robinson in ""Key Largo"", not shabby, entertaining in a movie which is really not memorable at all. The noise of it would have been unbearable in a movie theater but I saw it at home and could control the sound level and fast-forward. I've only seen a handful of movies that shouldn't have been over in ninety minutes and this one really didn't even have that much content. The dialog seemed to have been pieced together from the dead bodies of older scripts. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman grace any film by their acting abilities but I kept waiting for Christian Bale to say, ""Go on. Make my day"". Monique Curnan was notable in her supporting role. The rest of the major players seemed to be phoning it in.",0
"I'm giving the Dark Knight a 1 to lower its overall rating. This movie was good but it wasn't great. When I think of great movies I've seen this one would definitely not pop into my head. First off Christian Bale is not that great as batman he seems corny and a little to cocky and is nerdy to me, actually made the movie worse . And what was with the nasally voice, what like everybody seeing half of the guys face doesn't give it away, but he has to hide his voice. Second Yes Heath Ledger passed away right after the movie and had the best performance in the movie and is a great actor besides the point, But to be honest lets not discredit Danny Devito what an amazing performance he did as the penguin in batman returns and one of the most underrated actors ever. Speaking of Batman Returns I actually love the movie and thought it was allot better than the Dark Night and I think michael keaton is a much better actor than Christian bale and was allot cooler batman. The worst performance in the movie was Maggie gyllenhaal what a boring, dull acting job she put on, I don't know if its just her personality but she was not very good and didn't seem like the effort was there, And again I thought Michele Feifer did a much better acting job and was awesome as catwomen. All in all this movie was at best a tiny bit above average.",0
"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The actors are good, as is the cinematography and the editing, but that's that. The script is a bunch of completely rubbish lines with no real meaning and special effects that have been done thousands of times and aren't interesting enough to keep our attention. The score is distracting.The villain is the most implausible villain I have ever seen. People who do evil things have purposes, the Joker doesn't have any. Even if there was a person like that, s/he wouldn't be able to have minions, because that kind of madness isn't a shared one. People kill for power or revenge, (or money, which is another type of power), basically. They have to have a purpose to unite and do evil things. All of the BS the joker said about evil and good completely miss the point about good, evil and humanity. They simply don't make sense.And what makes me furious is the fact that a lot of intelligent (or at least more or less intelligent) people are quoting those lines as if they meant anything. They don't. And they aren't even entertaining.",0
"The red coats are coming! The red coats are coming!Once again the English is trying to invade the land of the free. IMDb. I apologize for not believing those who warned me of this movie.People actually walked out. I very much wanted to however I was with a friend. He apparently wanted out as well. Being respectful of each other did not say anything till we discussed the movie, which took about 2 seconds. Movie is hollow. There is no beginning, and most important, there is no END. Batman's voice was annoying. Heath was okay, especially with his disappearing trick. Oh yes, one person clapped at the end. I wanted to jump down and beat the hell out of him. Then realized, he was slapping his head for it went numb. For those who don't believe the negative ratings, I want you to go watch it.",0
"""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is a tacky, trashy, mindless, ultra violent piece of garbage. It will bore anyone with a mature mind. ""The Dark Knight"" consists of one sadistic, pointlessly violent scene after another. There is no point to these scenes except to extract money from the pockets of teenage boys who have had no experience of real life. ""The Dark Knight"" is a drug. It pushes violence and sadism. That's it. That's what you get for your ten bucks.""The Dark Knight"" is a sick product of a sick system. What's the difference between a blockbuster death-fest like this, and an act of actual terrorism? How many deaths do films like this contribute to? How much suffering? Pointless, ugly, violent, sadistic movies peddle violence as the drug of choice to mindless consumer hoards who lack discrimination, life experience, wisdom or balance.Teenage boys who spend all their time playing video games and having no experience of three-dimensional reality see a movie like this and conclude that the world is like this: cool criminals torture passive victims and meet no resistance. Hey, Thanks, Hollywood, for flushing your refuse into young male minds. Ka-ching. How much more violent and sadistic will such films have to be in the future to make that cash register sing? Let's up the ante.The Plot? Heath Ledger puts on a ridiculous series of ticks, costumes and make-up and tries really hard to get taken seriously as a master criminal / master actor. There is no real performance there because there is no real life there. In one scene, Ledger, a slight young man, murders a very large, muscular, professional criminal, and a black man ? white supremacists will like that part ? with a pencil. No. In real life that would not happen. Nor, in real life, would a man who shoots his every accomplice be able to do pull off any of the stunts ledger does in this film.The movie is utterly implausible. This won't matter to its fans, who talk only to other fans who worship films like this as they do. In their solipsistic, computer-generated echo chamber, ""The Dark Knight"" is the greatest film ever made. These fans have little contact with anyone not exactly like themselves, and can't see any flaws in their judgment. Though saturated in violence, these fans can't even see why a skinny guy like Ledger murdering a muscular, hardened criminal with a pencil is a silly, nasty, scene that exists only to up the sadism ante, not to have any relationship with reality. Though saturated in violence, these fans would panic at the merest contact with the real world, with the real violence occurring in places like Iraq, or federal prisons.Christian Bale is an interesting actor and was fun to watch in the previous batman. He's hardly on screen here. There is nothing interesting about the sets or costumes, and as for the special effects, how many chase scenes and big explosions have been on screen recently? Nothing new. Nothing interesting. The intelligent viewer will move along, or simply select a better film.",0
"I really tried to watch this movie. I enjoyed the first scene and that was about it. After the first scene or so i was so annoyed. i could not follow this movie to save my life. i was utterly confused and annoyed most of the time. i have never in my life seen so much dialog in a batman movie. where has batman gone? where has the joker gone? Hands down this was the worse. To make matters worse this was the looooooooooooooongest movie i have ever had to sit through. the movie was totally boring. furthermore, i cannot believe that so many people liked this movie. it seems that 90% of you loved the movie and 10% of us hated the movie. This movie really really really sucked.",0
"Indulge me for a second here. Imagine that you're a studio executive, and someone is pitching the movie to you. And here's what he says: ""All right. My movie's based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city. In it, there's going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died. And then there's going to be this other guy who, for no given reason, dresses up like a clown, acts creepy, and goes around killing people. The bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands. Meanwhile, there's this other guy who's a perfectly nice lawyer, but then his face gets burned, so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has."" It sounds kind of funny and interesting to you, but just as you're accepting it, the person suddenly coughs under his breath, ""Oh yeah. And I'm going to take it seriously like it was Shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience."" I'm not sure if that's exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went, but it seems to be a reasonable guess. Let's face it. The whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous. It could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved. And yet, it's still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life, and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across. How does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective? What does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil? Why would anyone be proud that they kept campiness out of this despite the fact that it is a campy movie? Give me the days of Adam West. At least his show made me happy rather than depressed.",0
"It is inconceivable that this movie is anywhere near the Top 250. It is 2.5 hours of a coarse voice, explosions, cheap one liners, and terrible plot.Batman Begins, I thought was brilliant. It had genuine pathos, its characters were very believable and had depth to them. The acting was phenomenal.But this piece of crap, is completely the opposite. I have seen spaghetti westerns and children's cartoons with better acting then The Dark Knight. With the exception of the Joker, by Ledger, who was decent.There is no screenplay. There are explosions. I think Michael Bay actually produced and directed this.There is a random side plot to Hong Kong that had no purpose or place in the story. The cell phone tracking technology is the dumbest and most far fetched thing I have ever seen in a film.The only reason this movie gets any recognition or praise is because of Ledger's death. That plus the Batman and Joker fanboys that flood IMDb to give this crap a 10. They like how 'cool' Joker was, and sided with him, and they feel bad for Ledger. A + B = in top 10 of IMDb.This movie is completely forgettable and deserves no awards and none of your time. It DOES deserve to be an example of a horrendously written, poorly shot, poorly lit, pathetic excuse of a movie.",0
"I had to give this movie a 1. While I enjoyed the movie, my vote is to balance out the insane ranking of this movie at number six in the top 250. WTF? This film is not the sixth best film of all time. Maybe near the bottom of that list. Christan Bale was a little over the top, and while I think Heath Ledger was great in his role, this movie was a little long. I started looking at my watch after about an hour and 45 minutes. Go ahead, hate on me, but this is my opinion. I think the reason there is so much hype on this film is that Mr. Ledger, may he rest in peace, died before the film came out. Aside from his performance, along with some flashes of brilliance out of Aaron Eckhart, it was a good film. And, from the people calling this the greatest comic book movie ever, I still say go look at Spiderman 2. That is the best comic book/superhero movie of all-time, with Superman 2 a close second.",0
"I waited until the DVD came out and the initial media coverage had played out. This movie made money only due to the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. Throughout the movie I transitioned from ""when is this movie going to get good"" to ""when is this movie going to end.""Christian Bale is a fine actor and we were able to see his talents in the first installment. He had very few scenes where the audience could see these talents in this movie. He was regulated to the Batman Costume and his Clint Eastwood voice impersonation. This was unfortunate. Heath Ledgers performance was good, but not award worthy. He kept sticking out his tongue while speaking to make his character look crazy. Gary Oldman has played much better bad guys in his day and Heath Ledgers performance does not match any of those or Jack's for that matter. Maggie Gyllenhaal was fine but her role was so limited that they could have pulled all her scenes from the movie and the plot would not have skipped a beat. She is a fine actress but we did not get to see much of those talents in this movie.Aaron Eckharts did an excellent job however his characters transformation into Two Face was rushed. It was kind of like they ran out of time and had to rush him into the bad guy role because they spent to much time elsewhere. I will probably check out the third installment when the time comes, but I hope they get back to the format of the first movie. They let the the actors do the work in that version vice putting all the emphasis the superhero & bad guy characters. If they are not going to let Christian Bale act then they can put anybody into the batman suite and it will not matter. This installment is also getting to the borderline where far fetched gadgets are concerned.It's unfortunate this movie made so much money as it will give the production team a false sense of accomplishment. If they repeat this performance they will bomb next time around unless they catch another break with another unfortunate off set tragedy.",0
"*Disclaimer -- may contain spoilers! *Sorry, people, despite all the unbelievable hoopla, this movie is terrible. The acting is wooden, the story line is moronic, the endless one dimensional tirades about heroes and anti-heroes are totally childish and idiotic.The much praised Ledger in the role of Joker is laughable. There is nothing in his act that is worth mentioning. As a matter of fact, he was overacting big time, and it made it painful to watch his presence on the screen.The hand-to-hand fighting scenes were retarded, slow as molasses. Compare the martial art in this movie to the martial art in the Bourne trilogy -- night and day.Even ""Batman and Robin"" is more enjoyable to watch than this sorry excuse for an action film. Two thumbs down, way, way down...",0
I gave this film a one just to pull down the overall score of the film - it doesn't deserve the 10th place on top 250 list. There is no way that this film deserves ten points! Heath Ledger was great in his role as a Joker - no doubt about that. His early departure from the land of the living makes his role stand out in many peoples minds and give a extra glitter to whole movie. Without Joker this film would have much less ten point votes.Story really was bloated with too many characters - most of them just showing their face in the movie without any significance to the main storyline. Scarecrow and batman-boys (or what they were called) were totally unnecessary bypassers in the first half of the movie. Story was all over the place and it didn't have the consistency or the red line that it could follow. Many scenes were just boring and ridiculous. This film really didn't give nothing good to the whole Batman saga.,0
"I know people will hate me for giving this movie 2 stars, but allow me to explain why the rating is deserved. I watched this movie twice and my initial impression of it was confirmed on the second viewing. The tagline of the movie is ""Welcome to a world without rules."" But even someone who likes the movie must realize this is absurd, because the rules of the film are strictly defined from the start. Batman is PERFECT GOOD, and the Joker is PERFECT EVIL. Whenever it's the cops versus Batman in this movie, we know the cops are wrong and Batman is on the side of good. He's just that good. And the Joker is so evil that he doesn't even have a motive. He's there to create a force of perfect chaos which Batman is duty-bound to fight.To deny that this movie is about terrorism is to deny the well-executed thrill elements such as the videos released to the press and closed-circle moral tests (on the ferries; similar to United 93). These are borrowed directly from the terrorist playbook, and one persistent element, the ticking time-bomb scenario which Batman solves by brutally beating people up until he gets the information he wants, is derived from our fear of terrorism even though ticking time-bombs NEVER happen in real life. When you compare the movie to reality, though, an outrageous discrepancy is made evident. Terrorists are not born psychopaths like the Joker. They are poor, scared people driven to violence only by persistent reinforcement of hatred and duty. That's WHY there are no ticking time-bombs: true psychopaths do not act like the Joker, and terrorists are not true psychopaths.In this movie, the only mistake Batman makes is when he injures himself swerving his motorcycle so that he doesn't kill the Joker. He is just too good to kill his enemy. Three thousand years of storytellers are laughing themselves to tears in Heaven at our image of a hero. Read Shakespeare. Read the Iliad. See if you can figure out for yourself what kind of travesty this is.The areas where this film deviates from standard superhero crap only condemn it further. Batman creates a magical cell phone network, which his buddy says a violation of privacy; the film makes his buddy out to be a spineless coward, because Batman needs his magic to do good. Do you see the problem here? Here it is: Batman doesn't exist in real life.To call this movie the best film of the year, or, as IMDb currently reckons it, the best film of all time, is to admit that we want to believe in a world where good battles evil. It creates a worldview where ""good"" people will not have to admit their own problems, and ""evil"" people can be rounded up and beaten half to death without any moral qualms. It is EXACTLY this kind of mentality which has caused the war in Iraq, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo Bay.I award this movie eight stars for execution, but subtract five stars for its incorrect, dehumanizing, and morally stunted outlook on human nature. Thus, it ends up with three stars, which I think is more than generous.",0
"As far as cinematographic masterpieces, this is not one. This movie is not in a the same league as movies such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or Schindler's List."" It is enjoyable, but only the last half. The first half plays to be predictable and foolish. When I go see a Batman movie, I want to see an entertaining flick, not one trying desperately to be deep.Heath Ledger's 'Joker' is a joke. He will not win an Oscar for this, and he shouldn't be nominated. Any one who has read the comic books knows the Joker is not scared because of a knife wound. He does NOT try to mask his appearance with makeup. Nolan's idea of a distraught application is myopic. The reason The Joker has a more colorful appearance is due to an accident involving acid, which bleached his face and colored his hair and lips.""Batman Begins"" is much better and a more entertaining way to spend your time.",0
"Unfortunately, this is my first review here at IMDb. And it HAD to be this ""movie"".. First of all, I enjoyed Batman franchise and, of course, start of Nolan's career..he promised so much!! Boy was I in a surprise.. After hearing media bragging the acting of sadly, now deceased, young Ledger I thought OK, Nolan is back in his saddle where he belongs..Not only I realized he's not back, but that he's discovering new depths of personal and spiritual descension. Christopher, if you're reading this, please take time and sit back in your comfy chair, turn off the lights and start pondering on your future..This is the point of no return, choose carefully. Making good films, or blah films like this.And to people calling this art,just one remark..the only art involved in this film was PR, and nothing else. Filmmakers, stop letting your financiers do the ""work"" your film should do by itself..exploiting someone's death like that really makes my stomach churn. Chris come back to basics, and satisfy yourself as well as true film lovers. Forget cash..wish you all the luck, mate.PS. Dreck Knight's optimum grade should not be over 6, but I voted it 1 because it seems mucho people need a brain transplant",0
"This movie is seriously over hyped crap. From a completely technical view it has some merits. It's well filmed, the shots and cutting are phenomenal. The plot has some merit although there was a whole of one thing I didn't see coming throughout the whole film. The one scene I enjoyed is on the boats, a deep look into humanity's fragile tempers. Christian Bale is terrible in his role of batman. His voice is so forced, he makes it way too gravelly and just botches the whole thing. He allows absolutely no subtlety and the love story angle is so contrived. God he was terrible. Oooh now we get to the poster boy Heath Ledger... OK I do have to grant that he did a fairly good job in his portrayal of the joker, his lines are well delivered and his acting is good. But this idea that he is now the holy grail of acting is just stupid. He died so now everyone feels like they can't critique him. When did death make you amazing? Fine then Hitler was a saint cause he died, we aren't allowed to say he messed up.... ever. He did a good job but there have been far better actors. I feel the writing was almost as important to the character as his acting, doesn't matter how good you act if the writing sucks the movie sucks. On to a one Aaron Eckhart, decent acting. Far better in Thank you for smoking but that's besides the point. I don't have much to say other than he started really strong and finished off pretty weak. After one of the plot twists his acting just gets mediocre.All in all this movie would have been really good, I mean phenomenal if it weren't for all of the hype around it. I saw it in theaters a day or so after opening and enjoyed it.... until about the 4 millionth ""why so serious?"" half an hour after it was over. It was good but it belongs in maybe the low hundreds on the top 250 list not top 10.",0
"A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like ""masterpiece"" and ""crime-epic"". Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I don't blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys' hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious.I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want ""more realism"" as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents' murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isn't a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks don't pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what.I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works.EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros. & the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things.",0
"How could this movie possibly have received so much acclaim? OK, it's competently executed, both in terms of acting and production values - but then with the money spent on it, hopefully that should be taken for granted. And certainly it has some fine actors in it, and they give every impression of fully believing in their work. But what the heck is the point of it supposed to be? I'm sorry, but I just absolutely hated it. It reminds me of a local case in the press here in Toronto a while ago where some 'art student' made a movie of a cat being tortured to death. Since he actually tortured a cat to death to make it, he was charged and prosecuted, and his defence was that it was 'art'. Well... at least all the people tortured and killed in this movie presumably were only faking it and weren't actually hurt. But I still don't think it has any more claim to be worthwhile or to be art. It's obnoxious rubbish... and I strongly suggest that if you haven't seen it and are considering doing so, you think of some better use for your time (which would be pretty much anything not actually harmful to your health or anybody else's).",0
"Too long, too dark, and too serious. The darkness is unavoidable - but exacerbated by the length, and the fact that for a movie about a superhero, it is entirely too serious. No matter how hard we try, the idea of a superhero is still a bit crazy. Imagine Bill Gates or Warren Buffet as superheroes - it's silly. So why does the film take itself so seriously? Also, it seems that the Batman story slips to the side in parts, as though the film is intent on tackling too many issues all at once. This isn't said to be contrary - the movie can be legitimately difficult to watch. It's simply too long for the content. It's not a bad film - but it's not an all-time great either.",0
"This film is basically average.NONE of the performances in this film are anything worth getting over exited about. Heath Ledger's performance was good. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't even great. Just like Ian Curtis his death did him the world of good. I'm not saying he wasn't a capable actor; I'm simply saying he wasn't anything special.Have we reached an age where licking your lips and snuffling is regarded as 'a performance that should earn him every award known to man'?He is only regarded as being so super good because he's dead - simple as that.Watch Tim Burton's Batman, it's a better film.",0
"I'm probably one of the last people in the world to see this movie, and I'm glad I didn't spend $10+ to see it in the theaters. Technically, the effects are amazing, and Heath Ledger does give a very good performance as The Joker (though crazy people are the easiest characters to portray IMHO). My issues with the film are: Batman resorts to physical torture in several scenes. The Batman I know would scare criminals, mostly through the fear of the mysterious ""bat man"". However, dropping a crime boss off a building to break his ankles is pretty extreme, and even his treatment of The Joker in the interrogation room is over the top.The film has too many plot lines...romance triangle, Two Face, both add extra baggage. The ""Two Face"" story line (coupled with a love triangle) could be a film on its own. And how about the Wayne Enterprises employee who was going to reveal Batman? Plot holes galore....I can suspend my disbelief and let Batman ""fly"", but how can the Joker sneak explosives into hospitals and ferry boats in MASSIVE quantities without anyone noticing? Too long by about 30 minutes. If they had trimmed a few plot lines it might have worked better.So enjoyable to watch, and probably a 7 rather than a 5, but I feel I need to vote down a bit to offset all the crazy 10 ratings.",0
"I can't believe this movie got so high ratings! Have you all lost your minds?! This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, and I'm not talking Batman's kicks being more than match for bullets! This is a comic-based movie, suspension of disbelief is due with regard to things like that or cops cooperating with Batman (cops don't like sharing *any* power, and neither does the govt apparatus, which would rather have Joker murder a hundred of civilians than let one vigilante like Batman go free).Where suspension of disbelief is NOT due are the movie's messages that it dumps in truckloads on viewer's heads! Aw the poor corrupted cop who did this because of her mother's hospital bills! Aw hear ye the socialized medicine is needed! Aw! Aw we do spying on people where necessary but it's still wrong! Aw! Aw we never kill villains, even when they wrong-do us! Aw! Aw the prisoners are at heart good people, we just should re-socialize them more! Aw! The scene that topped all the other in hypocrisy and idiocy was when one of the prisoners has thrown the detonator for the 'civilian' boat through the window. In real life he'd be pushing the button in a second. This is where the movie gets it all wrong. Or perhaps it lies to us but in such way that we should notice? After all, at the end of the movie we are lectured that some things are more important than the truth? Like, having a hero with bad taste in women? Speaking of which, you don't really believe that Brucey and Harvey would swoon all over the mediocre-looking Rachel? In real *real* world the two would rather be jointly gang-banging the Russian ballerina (which was a stunner) than trying to get Rachel's affection, who in turn had a misfortune of a scriptwriter getting her spout the mandatory post-feminist line (oh Bruce don't make me any chance blah blah), but let's put this aside and come back to make-believe real world.Strangely, in this movie the only character with an ounce of sanity was Joker, he just did not let that sanity get in his way. Have you noticed this? He was the only character that the scriptwriters let tell the truth; how things were in his view. Everyone else was a puppet with mind tied up by shallow politically-correct slogans. So even here the movie got it wrong: the Joker *was* sane, just evil.All in all, this was not the epic battle between good and evil, but between dumb and evil. Perhaps that is why this movie was after all so *boring*. The characters are shadows of their former selves from previous Batman movies. This is a version disinfected from everything that has mental life, like in one South Park episode where the directors digitally replaced all the guns with walkie-talkies in their movies. This movie has had that kind of surgery applied to it at the scriptwriting stage. The result is a neutered cat instead of a tiger. Tragedies portrayed in it are fake, we feel that characters portrayed in it do not feel what they exhibit, but exhibit what they feel they *should have been* exhibiting, because they feel watched all the time.One of reasons the movie is not believable is precisely because good guys do not pull the trigger. The good guys are PC pussies with lawsuits worrying them more than bullets. The dumb ideology, and yes, politicized world-view, emerges even in selection of the main hero: a lawyer. Lawyer as a hero? Puhlease. Everyone is a walkie-talkie for some false line, you get the idea. This is a movie staffed with mannequins instead of characters.I had a gnawing suspicion somewhere at the back of the head when I was watching the movie that all of it was result of cold calculation, that it was all just designed to pull emotional strings of naivetés with whatever calls, once to ""never kill a villain"", then to ""tax-funded health-care is Good!"" thing, then whatnot. This movie does not believe in itself. Why should I believe in it then? And don't tell me 'it's just a movie'. Yes, it's just a movie. Just an exceptionally dumb one.",0
"Sorry folks...this one gets the one star. It is a great movie, but the fact that it is number one on IMDb is just an outrage.I think one of the other posters on here said it best: ""Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.""Heath Ledger was the only phenomenal actor.This movie is unoriginal. End of story.",0
"Terrible acting (I burst out laughing a few times at the voice of the actor portraying batman), non existent character development, a plot so thin you can see through it in the first ten seconds of the film, and, on occasion, direction so incompetent as to not warrant comment.It also goes without saying that this is pure, unadulterated, US propaganda, designed to legitimise wrongdoing and evil, of the most laughable kind since Transformers.Really, it's not even the best film I've seen today.Also, don't believe the online hype, most of the people commenting on this page will be paid shills.I have yet to meet anyone IRL who thinks that it is anything like as good as these reviews make out.",0
"Ridiculously overrated, monumentally disappointing.Whoa, IMDb won't let me post this. It's too short, obviously.Well, then let me tell you this - I never cared for the re-franchising of Batman. It's just more of the Hollywood-style money making. And the more money they put into a film and its promotion, the more hype they create. But it sadly isn't just about them wanting us all to go see the movie. No, they get really greedy and after a certain point is reached, they proclaim this same movie is a piece of art.It's that simple. And if you can succeed in believing it is, it makes your life easier and jollier. You go to IMDb.com, you give it a 10, you read some exuberantly positive comments and smile contentedly, you read some unfavourable ones and mutter to yourself that there are always idiots who just don't get it, and you're happy, cause millions of people are desperately trying to prove to each other that they are part of something bigger than life, and are succeeding in that endeavour, and you are one of them.Not me, guys, not me. I like a lot of stupid films, but not this one. It makes me sick, for it reminds me how gullible we all are and just how much we want to dream. But we only want the dreams to come on the big screen - this is one of the many possible ways, kindly provided by our great benefactors, we can spend our ugly dollars on something shiny and new and inspiring, and harmless. And easy to digest.So, be happy, eat your popcorn, feel nice, eat well after the movie, sleep tight, dream beautifully, but don't bother trying to wake up, cause we are all in a really comfortable place and waking up will be very painful. On the other hand, the dream factory could keep you contented by offering you another piece of art for 10$ or thereabouts. Kudos to our benefactors and encore!",0
"I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, it's still good entertainment compared to other 21th centuries block busters that fail in every possible way. But it has NOTHING to do in the Top 250. Sorry IMDb, kids who know nothing about cinema took over your ranking system.The main grudges I'd have about this movie would be:1. It is way too long!!!! It'd been a while since I last experienced the feeling of expecting the credits to begin each time a scene would end. I was like ""OK, then, the end?"" and the movie would keep going into some nuke the fridge like action scene that has nothing to do with the main plot, as if the directors told themselves ""People paying money to go to the theater want to have bang for their bucks so let's give them 56 explosions, 87 wrecked cars and 77 dead guys"" (fictive count, but you get the idea) Toward the end I was completely out of the movie, focusing on not peeing in my pants.2. What's with 2 face !? I didn't know about 2 face making an appearance in this episode. I thought it was all about the Jocker VS The World. Boy I was surprised to see this coming straight out of nowhere right in the middle of the movie. But hey, at that time I thought ""nice way to introduce 2 face, could it be the next batman they make will have him as the main villain?"" So I was kinda expecting a ""The End"" screen when, say, the Jocker sets him free from the hospital so that the movie is still coherent with the others. Like, ""OK this time batman half won, the jocker is introduced as its arch ennemy and there's another freak out there to spice it up, the end, to be continued..."" But the movies keeps going and going and going and going............ ALTHOUGH IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY!! It's as if they packed 2 movies in 1, seriously they should have called it ""Batman Vs The Jocker featuring 1 extra villain""Of course, there's also the ""2 face is dead"" thing when we all know he's coming back a few episodes later. I can't understand why they made it that way. It would have been so much easier to have for example the 2 of them drop into water and only have batman to reach the shore leaving a question mark over 2 face's fate. Completely cliché, sure, but at least they're not killing someone to have him reappear in a sequel (oh hold on, maybe batman and gordon and all the cops can't tell the difference between a corpse and a living fellow?)I could go on forever on all the flaws like:_ cell phone crap (yeaaaah right OK it's batman but still.... and like 1 guy alone could trace millions in real time...)_ stupid prisoner's dilemma in the boats (since when criminals have morals?)_ ""I burn money 'cause I don't care but I rob banks"" stance of the Joker_ the batcave is now located in an almost empty room in the docks_ alfred burns his master's letters (come on, why so serious alfred?)_ batman is strong with men but weak with dogs (where is the batkick at?)_ batman's awful voice (puberty at 35 between Begins and TDK?)_ the joker has no plan but everything goes as planned every time_ the batpunch carpets big fellas but the jocker can handle it no problem_ crime syndicates give away their money to keep to some Chinese guy nobody knows, trusting him to keep it safe (since when criminals trust each other over money concerns?)_ gotham changed a lot between 2 episodes...and on and on ...I repeat this is NOT a bad movie itself, it's just WAY overrated. It's just another action movie that you go see to put your brain on low power mode for a couple of hours.I would have put a 5 or 6 on it but we need to counterbalance the tens that cinema uneducated dumb kids put.",0
"THE DARK KNIGHT is ALL hype and no substance! I've seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful. Basically, it is too long and convoluted as all get out. It felt 4 hours long to me the first time I saw it...no kidding! I guess the confusing part is worse than the long part. If a film flows smoothly for its run, length ought not be an issue, but TDK is utterly messy and confusing for it's running time. So Nolan wants a REALISTIC version of BATMAN? Then explain SOME things to us! The big one is HOW DOES JOKER SET ALL THIS STUFF UP?At least BATMAN BEGINS was grounded in realism, explained motivations, techniques, and plans, and had a aura of realism. After BB was over, I remember thinking I LIKED THIS MOVIE! Although I'm a Burton Batman fan, I admit that Nolan did a very good job with BB; it feasibly defined a realistic Batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value. And the plot made sense! But after TDK was over, my impression was WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? Some points about why TDK is a weak film to me: *Harvey Dent swallows all that gasoline and isn't even sick enough to hurl! He is badly burned, but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the Bejesus out of anyone? NO ONE is shocked by the way he looks! Seriously, Nolan?*Gordon and Batman decide that Dent/TwoFace will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people. EXCEPT for them, Gordon's family, and that bad cop Ramirez! I'm sure they will ALL keep it a secret...Plothole! *Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes not attractive! Katie Holmes from BB wasn't jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but she WAS fairly easy on the eyes! And Holmes worked much better in this role in BB, had a LOT more chemistry with Bale, and had an important function to the story. When Joker says that she (Gyllenhall's Rachel) is a beautiful woman, I was like, NO SHE'S NOT! Gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than Holmes, but Holmes was actually much more right for the role of Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesn't cut it in TDK. *Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman, who just exists in this film, nothing else) has the ability to do ANYTHING technological? This includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in Gotham City simultaneously. Or did Bruce Wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it? Either way...OK. Yeah. Right. Whatever. In BB, the stuff Fox was selling Wayne at least seemed plausible. In TDK, it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble!*Batman and Joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly, chewed up by dogs, fall from multiple story buildings and don't even get hurt. When Batman saved Rachel, they fell from the penthouse of a CHICAGO high-rise for cripe's sake. That must have been 100 stories easy! No bones broken, no trauma, just ho-hum, back to business.*That climactic ferry boat scene is pure de Hollywood manipulation! It is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like TDK is some kind of original, provocative piece. Instead, it comes across as sappy, maudlin, and empty. The ending to that scene is soooooo predictable! *In general, though, TDK is choppily edited, is populated with one-dimensional, lifeless characters, is humorless, convoluted as heck, has dull dialogue, and is VERY cliché. I mean, it's barely even a DECENT movie!Christian Bale was great in BB, but in TDK, Nolan's hack direction and the script really let him down, making him look like a laughingstock as a hero. He was barely even in TDK and when he was in it, you didn't get any feel for the character so well-established in BB. What makes Bruce Wayne/Batman tick? What does he really want? Just based on one dinner where Dent spouts about being a crusader, Wayne thinks that he's THE ONE, the savior of Gotham City? Not very deep character development. In addition to Freeman, you have Michael Caine as Wayne's butler/accomplice Alfred, Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, all giving rather lifeless performances. Ironically, I think Eckhart has the biggest male role in the film, but unfortunately Dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer. Really, Bale shares lead honors with Oldman, Eckhart, and Ledger; actually, Oldman and Eckhart may have bigger roles in this than Bale and Ledger! Who wants a Batman flick where neither Batman (the main hero) nor the Joker (the main villain) have the biggest role? These skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short-sighted character development.Tim Burton's surrealistic, neo-noir, skewed, artsy, comic book BATMAN flicks (BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS) are truly the best Batman movies. We accept at face value those films because Burton's unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie, but also succeeded in a way that Nolan's films just cannot. Batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of Gotham?!. No way, not in superhero world, not acceptable! And I don't care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film think!",0
"I suppose many people might be offended by the simple suggestion that this movie could be anything less than ""the best movie ever"" or perhaps just ""the best movie of 2008"", that it was merely okay, for superhero action drivel.But to me, that's what it was. It's the old good vs evil thing, the good billionaire dons latex suit to fight the evil for no apparent reason other than that he's the good guy, and the bad guy being ridiculously-over-the-top so, with a similarly solid rationale. Then there is the another good guy who has to experience a biographical kink in the form of a girlfriend blown to pieces and some cosmetically challenging facial events, and he becomes the semi-good guy. Lots of explosions, pseudo- technology, vehicles driving above the speed limit, lots of fighting, the end.I never really understood the appeal of the Batman franchise, which turned a unremarkable set of comic books (uh, ""graphic novels"") into an unremarkable series of movies. Yet, many people seem to love it, and consequently another one of those hit the streets, bigger, better, more expensive, and this time with an IMDb rating that even made me curious.To be sure, there are many interesting and impressive aspects of the movie. The director, for one---I very much enjoyed Memento, and give Nolan a lot of credit for it. The cast of The Dark Knight is nothing short of impressive, with certified talent such as Caine, Ledger, Oldman, Bale, and Eckhardt. And, of course, the special effects are great, the fights are well-choreographed and fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent, and so on. It is, no doubt, a technically well-executed action flick, which I suppose is all that it wants to be, and probably all most of the people seeing it in the cinema expect it to be.But it is also other things. Overlong, for instance. The trivial comic-book plot does not sustain 150 minutes of interest, its self-indulgent repetitiveness becoming boring quickly, the little character development happening in cartoonish hit-you-over-the-head-with-hamfisted-symbolism style, the rest being fights, battles, destruction, and some more fights. The range of excellent actors that make up the cast remains woefully underused, although we do get so see some excellent acting, most notably from Ledger and Oldman. Ledger's Joker, in particular, does not require a very broad range, but it's far out in the crazy and psychopathic part of the spectrum, and Ledger manages to turn a fairly ridiculous and cartoonish villain into a three-dimensional and utterly creepy character, which is testimony to his acting ability. By and large, however, one does get the feeling that performance per talent ratio isn't a very good one, and that this crowd could have been put to better use in a more grown-up production with less of a focus on expensive action sequences.Overall, this movie is way over-hyped for what it is, it's not among the top ten movies of all time in my book, but then neither is ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"". It does have its moments, though, but it could easily be cut down to 90 minutes.",0
"I gotta go against the grain here, but after all the hype I've read here I expected no less than cinematic greatness. What I got instead is that I got bored right out the theater. It's the only movie I actually walk out on this year, and I've seen some pretty bad ones.Scenario: linear, predictable, dark long and boring. Main actor(Christian Bale): Give me a break, I've seen trees with more emotional depth.Supporting actors: Yeah, OK, Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was inspired, to say the least. I was impressed, a very difficult character to impersonate and he pulled it off. The rest of the crew was adequate, no more. Special effect: Great, but we're used to seeing great by now, and there's too much of it.Editing: Inconsistent with bad rhythm. Music: Standard Hollywood canned fare.I found the whole indigestible, rooting for the Joker to kill them all about 3/4 of the way in so it would end and I could walk out; ended walking out anyway without even caring how it ends.",0
"A nihilistic style piece, where all the exceptional creative and artistic talents are wasted in enhancing humanities most negative emotions. The movie may be well made, but as a piece of fiction it fails to justify its existence. It identifies and taps humanities' core emotions, but does not understand how they operate, and thus cannot raise their level. Scaring people is easy. But understanding the purpose of fear and how it transforms into courage and clarity is to understand the true nature of heroism and what really inspires humans. This film lacks any understanding of how good people have actually been able to defeat tyranny, by turning the fear around. There is an exceptional opportunity for creating genuine hope from the story's premise, but it is lost, in part because I don't believe the director knows how to find it. Finally, the actor playing The Joker appeared to show at least two of the strongest indicators of a vulnerability to develop mental illness. It may not have been wise to have such an individual play this kind of character. I honestly would not recommend this movie to anyone.",0
"Two viewings. First viewing reaction: ""Possibly the worst film ever made. Brilliant, subtle Joker performance weighed down by an overly pretentious film. Why is Batman even in the film? Confusing chase scenes. Confusing to the point of boredom. Ridiculous James Bond episode in Hong Kong. At what point between the previous Batman film and this one did Gotham city miraculously turn into Chicago? Stupid cell phone ploy. Fell asleep halfway through. Woke up in the middle of a Morgan Freeman plea for individual freedom, or something like that. I'm bored."" Maybe I missed something. Second viewing reaction:""The worst film ever made.

"I'm pretty serious about this one because I love movies. And since this movie is being rated as the best movie of all time, I was expecting something that could measure itself with the great movies of all time. I expected a movie that grips you, crawls under your skin and leaves you breathless. It does none of that. It is pretentious and inconsistent. It pretends to dig deep and dark and explore themes like morality, fate, good versus evil, heart versus mind, madness versus reason, and at the same time it wants to be this big spectacular action movie. But it fails miserably. It's all just a big clumsy pretentious inconsistent mess.Yes, Ledger is good, but for his performance to really contribute to the movie, there should have been context. If the rest just doesn't feel right, it looses its potential. If you throw a diamond on a mountain of poop, it doesn't change much of the way it looks or smells. Love interest Maggie Gyllenhaal (great performance in Stranger than Fiction) produces no chemistry at all, so I wasn't really blown away when she was blown up. Editing feels weird. But most of all it was the inconsistencies that got to me. And then not just the 'practical' ones (like the inconsistent protective quality of the batman suit; or why leave an extremely dangerous criminal unrestrained with a tubby policeman in his cell ('hostage volunteer? you, tubby?'); a schoolbus is used twice to make a grand escape? - do they come with teleporter machines these days?; why would you want to ride your batmobile face down?; Batman lowers his voice to be unrecognizable, but how hard is it to follow a batmobile with a helicopter to its hiding place?), but more importantly it's crucial plot/ morality inconsistencies. Yes, the White Knight went through some traumatic experiences, but to turn to the dark side so wholeheartedly and sadistically? And then to just let the Joker (at least indirectly responsible for his trauma) walk when he only needs to pull the trigger? Oh yeah, forgot, he's Mr. Coin Toss now. But even if he is guided by blind fate now, he still determines himself who he goes after and whether it's OK to threaten to blow out the brains of little kids. And then the Big Bad criminal who throws the detonator out off the window. Ah! The Joke is on you Joker! People are not what you make them out to be. Even the baddest bad ass has a good heart. Never mind that just before when the Joker threatened to blow up a hospital unless an innocent lawyer was killed, there was a crowd with guns ready to shoot the guy within no time. Also, what with the vote on the 'good people boat'? They vote to blow up the 'bad people' (democracy at its finest) but then Nobody has the balls to do it? So they don't blow up the other boat because they think it's unjust, but because they're spineless hypocrites.I applaud movies that try and deal with complex issues like conflicting emotions or morals, but to just make a big soup of it all under the pretense of 'but that's how life works, it's conflicting ideas, feelings and actions' is just a weak excuse for the inability or laziness to produce a good consistent story. Believe me, I detest black and white thinking and applaud the exploration of the Grey area. But that's not what this movie does. Piling a bunch of random inconsistent ideas on top of each other is not equal to exploring the Grey area.The climax is the ending though (it usually is). Our dark knight has to sacrifice himself, has to live like a hunted animal in the shadow, because the People would not be able to cope with the idea of Denth doing bad things, despite his recent traumas. So it's better to LIE to the public, because they are too stupid to make up their own mind and their faith in goodness of man would be lost forever (despite the fact that they just tried to establish with the boat-thing that there's goodness even in big bad criminals). So Batman (whose enemies take advantage of the fact that he doesn't kill) takes the blame for a bunch of random killings that could have been linked to anyone - a Joker perhaps? (even if they wanted to absolve Denth from his crimes -I mean, evidence/motive would have been needed to link it to Batman too?) and goes off running ('run Forrest!') into the night to save us another day. Because you just can't trust people to make up their own mind, it's better to lie to them. It's for their own good. Great morale. Straight from the White House? But ey, why so serious?",0
"So much has been said on the latest instalment of the revitalised Batman franchise, dead stars, posthumous Oscars, arrests at premiers, will it lead to a rise in knife crime? Etc. but the only relevant question is it any good? Well Hamlet this is not so all those five star reviews and people intent on gushing all over it can calm down. Yes its dark, yes Batman is plagued by his demons, yes Heath is great, it's not comparable to Michael Mann's Heat, when all is said and done this is an OK superhero movie but considering it cost $185 million its hard to see where all that money has been spent. From a bank heist beginning that meanders to a pointless appearance of the Scarecrow to Bale flying on to the screen it seems to push all the right buttons and at the point that the Joker does his magic trick you could still be forgiven for thinking this is a five star visual feast. But unfortunately the set up doesn't really lead anywhere, there are no set pieces and at times it is even incoherent in its plot which could be from trying to cram too much information in an already overlong film. The twists, yes there are a few, are boringly obvious and I'm really not sure what happens to Bruce Wayne's voice when he dons the Batsuit but it changes to sound like a sort of vaudevillian heavy breather. That said Heath did make me laugh, he is not the most iconic screen bad guy since Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, but he is good and the supporting cast all put in fine performances. The musical style has been borrowed from a Michael Mann film and the direction is brilliant in parts but as a whole it doesn't seem to gel together. Ironically the Jokers catch phrase is 'why so serious?' And if all involved had maybe listened to him and not be so serious, pretentious even then it may have been a much better film all round. Worth watching but not, as according to the IMDb, the greatest film of all time.",0
"BORING, UNEXCITING, TEDIOUS, OVERLONG and UNINTERESTING..only a few choice words I can think of off hand to describe this total and utter let-down of a film that everyone else seems to be raving about! What a load of absolute rubbish, it was a total waste of time from start to finish.I had originally decided not to see this film having not overly enjoyed Batman Begins but gave in in the end due to all the hype and the fact that it had soared to the No 1 spot in the IMDb database. I was absolutely shocked and amazed by this, how it can go ahead of such BRILLIANT films as SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and STAR WARS i'll never know, not to mention the masterpiece of LORD OF THE RINGS! I see TDK is currently in the No 3 position, all I can say is that I only hope it continues to drop places. To put things in perspective I wish I hadn't of bothered with TDK..within ten minutes I was sitting there in the cinema yawning my head off! For one thing I had difficulty understanding many of the sentences the characters were saying and for another the whole film just didn't hold my attention. I thought Christian Bale was boring and wooden in his role of Batman, with that silly voice when he's in the suit to match. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were fine as always but utterly underused. If their is one shred of goodness in this film through my eyes it would be for Heath Ledger as the Joker. His untimely death shortly after the making of this film did, i'll admit, help spur me on to see TDK and, after all the hype put out for his performance he certainly didn't disappoint. He truly stole every scene he was in and so deserves every credit he gets. He was a great young actor who will be sadly missed.I just can't believe how so many people love this film so much, what is the matter with all of you?!? No disrespect to any other IMDb reader/writer of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion but mine is one star for this film and one star only. TDK was the worst film of the summer for me, Wall-e was better by far! At least that film had bags of imagination, character development and story. This had nothing, even the action sequences were uninteresting and flat. It was so overlong too that, after a while, I was silently shouting at the screen - ""COME ON, GET ON WITH IT"".I will NEVER see another Batman film again in the cinema, I don't care what level the hype meter goes to. I knew this would be crap and it was. By the way, in case your wondering, my one star rating is for Heath Ledger's performance and for it alone.",0
"I mean,this is the best movie ever??the number ''1''??Is it better than ''the godfather'' or ''Braveheart''? I think not. People are talking a lot about Heath Ledger's performance,but in my opinion,Jack Nicholson was a much better joker,because he had a twisted sense of humor and a background that the viewer could relate with,this new joker is just a sick individual with no clear motivation and an absurd point of view. Shall the Academy give an Oscar to Ledger??Who cares???Everybody knows who are going to be the winners months before the ceremony,and i wouldn't be surprised if this stupid action flick won best movie,best director and all the other Oscars... Batman should be made for children to see it,how is that possible??This as an ultra-violent movie with Batman being a torturer in some scenes. Some people give ''the godfather'' 1 star and this bizarre experience 10...what is the world becoming??Does special effects and bizarre characters make a good movie??the best one ever???Only for the small minded... The good old days are over...and with this ''turd'' on the top of the list,IMDb looses all the credibility...if the Corleone's were living in Gotham, this joker wouldn't last a day uhauhauahauuahua....",0
"By far the most overrated hunk of junk i have ever viewed. Who the heck thinks this is a good movie. Its just another in a long line of stupid super hero/comic book movies that have come out to the theater in the past few years. The acting is terrible. From Batman himself who i couldn't understand half the things he was saying. To the very barely average performance of Ledger. They consider his role Oscar material? You've got to be kidding. You want to see a good performance, go rent Monster's Ball. Even the Patriot he was better. The special affects are nothing to go crazy about. Just your typical CGI thats not so spectacular nowadays. And that plot. Like that made allot of sense. But i guess like Adam Sandler movies, people like this garbage. To think this movie is getting higher ratings than the Godfather movies, Shawshank, Pulp Fiction, Schindler list, Star Wars and Casablanca shows you the mentality of todays movie viewer.",0
"I went into this film with a fresh mind, having not heard much about it or any spoilerish stuff. Other than the unfortunate passing away of Heath, everything else was neutral with me.Wow did this movie try too too hard. It was like it was auditioning itself to become part of the rotation on the Bravo or AMC channel. There were just way too many unnecessary story lines involved here, all trying to make things more complex than they really were, all with that constant gloomy depressed feeling too, both staples of ""serious"" films. Don't get me wrong, it started off with a nice bang with the Joker, but soon after that Harvey Dent and his whole campaign issues became involved, then that whole storyline of the guy trying to frame Bruce Wayne came up, and then that whole byline about the commissioner's secret operation, and then the whole kidnapping of the Oriental mobster came up, and then the three-way romance between Bruce, Harvey, and Rachel came up, and so on and so forth. And that's not even including all the other segments involving Joker meeting up all the mobsters and following up on his big plan. You see what I mean, it was just trying to hard in too many areas all at once. Iron Man did it quite nicely by not taking itself too seriously. Yes there were fantastical parts in that film, but it never wavered too long on one issue or tried to have too many issues plague the script all at once. And that brings up another point about the dark knight. Was I only one a little offended at how the script just wanted us to so easily accept the Joker and his small crew doing so much with so little. I mean I just kept thinking that there's too many variables that have to be ignored in order for this to happen, but the movie sure makes it seem like everything should be instantly taken as fact. Problem with all the powerful mob bosses and their hundreds of men? Don't worry, Joker took care of that with his one little meeting with them. - Problem with trying to kill Harvey Dent, who's being escorted by nearly the entire Gotham City Police force? Don't worry, Joker and a few henchmen inside a truck can take care of that, all while somehow managing to block off entire sections of the city streets too. - Problem with trying to get out of jail? Don't worry, Joker already planned on having some guy with a live bomb inside of him, and timed everything to the second. - Problem with trying to get all of Gotham onto two ferry boats charged with explosives? Don't worry, Joker must've figured out some way to block off ALL highways and freeways leading in and out of Gotham, not to mention figuring out a way to stop all of the airlines, trains, and the entire US government and it's military power too. All with a just a few henchmen too.Anyways this movie get a 5/10 from out of me.",0
"Gotham is cleaning its act up, Batman is a successful crime fighting Legend, Jim Gordon is moving up the ranks and Harvey Dent is a tour-de-force for the city as its high flying District Attorney. Nothing can go wrong, can it? Well that it is except for a lunatic criminal called the Joker decides to bring chaos to Gotham, Batman is faced with a criminal who will stop at nothing to make a point and is seemingly always one step ahead of the Dark Knight, will he cross the line and kill to stop the madman and make Gotham safe, and will Bruce Wayne get to hang up his cape and get the happiness he deserves.After Batman Begins the scene was set for a bigger and better film to follow and after hearing all the hype I felt that this film could not fail ...I was very wrong. There are a number of issues that I had with the film that I have yet to hear a good defence for. The great films may not be liked by everyone for bizarre reasons but their criticisms are usually swept aside by the faithful. There are far too many errors in this film for it to pass such tests. I will address them one at a time, as one by one these spoilt the film for me.The first is that the film drags and drags and drags. Around the time of Batman's big decision of who he gets to save seems to be the perfect time to end it, on an Empire style ending, instead it goes on and on and we have about thirty to forty minutes extra to wrap everything up that the film simply doesn't need. End it with suspense, leave me on a high, but if I'm looking at my watch you've failed.Two, the performance of Heath Ledger is not all that. Yes, he is dead and this is sad, but the Joker we get in this film is sadly not the Joker of ""The Killing Joke"" or the Joker of ""The Dark Knight"", sadly it is somewhere in-between and this version is very mish-mashy, added to that the make-up changes from scene to scene when the jokers skin is supposed to be white all the time, also the make-up should make him look like he's smiling, DO YOU GET IT WRITERS, HE IS CALLED THE JOKER. Did he laugh that often in the film, I think not, he hardly smiled at all either, what's that for? For me, the big star turn in the film is by Aaron Eckhart who is magnificent as Harvey Dent and seems to steal every scene that he is in. Eckhart cranks the film up and makes it his own, and this is what increases the rating as it does.The action sequences that are so gripping in the first film are sadly lacking here as the editing to make it a lower rating and get more bums on seats have cut the films strongest feature to shreds.The last thing that really trashes the film for me is the end sequence with the Joker's final trap, as there is little explanation of how he has done this, are we expected to believe that the Joker is magic as that is what it feels like the director is saying. I'm all for big surprises but this was just too unbelievable, and I'm saying that about a film that has a man dressing up as a giant bat! Many of the people I have spoken to claim to love the film yet so few have any defence of the errors I speak of here, many of them Jump in and agree, and sometimes even add to the list, which annoys me for two reasons, because it will mean that more rubbish will get churned out that is supposed to be good and also because people's standards by accepting sub-standard films as good are lowering and we should always, as viewers, expect more, and pace, performance, writing and even make-up should all be first rate when $170 million dollars have been spent. Maybe many people feel that because there is so much hype for a film, and so much critical acclaim that they must be wrong for not liking it, when the truth is that the people who don't like it all that much are the ones who are right and those that just suck up to the critics view are very wrong. Thankfully I have been here before and faced exactly the same backlash 14 years ago for saying I didn't enjoy ""Jurassic Park"" which had similar levels of hype and got similar levels of public favour at the time of release. I find it interesting that it is now so very far down the rankings as, upon release, it was supposed to be the best film ever, according to the critics.No film could get a reaction like this on these boards without some element of over-reaction, and in this case it's to Ledger's death, the best time to judge this film will be in a year's time when the hype has died down, and for those who can admit they made a mistake to rethink their over-hyped ratings. Disappointing.",0
"I think those media representatives from the film company can pat themselves on the back for the job they've done with the Dark Knight. The hype surrounding the film has been fever pitch for several months. The furore on IMDb to get the film to be number 1 is a prime example.This is the second instalment of the latest Batman franchise. The sad death of Heath Ledger has led to a clamour for an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. Whilst it may be the best acting performance of the film I personally think his previous work was much more rounded and deserving of Oscar recognition.The Dark Knight is a classic summer blockbuster ... all action, but not quite enough substance. I personally enjoyed the first instalment more, as this focused rather more on Bruce Wayne. It seems his Batman really needs to go and see the doctor this time because that voice sounds very bad.It would have been a much better film if one of the set pieces was dropped in place of adding some depth to the characters, but I'm sure a lot of the people who loved the film would violently disagree on that point. This is definitely a film for the adrenalin junkies.",0
"Spectacular and entertaining but no more than that. Batman Begins is way better. This movie has nothing to add that movie and/or original story.Be honest! What do you remember about this movie, a week after seeing it? Just the Joker walking out the exploding hospital I guess.Nicely done but not ""Nolan proof"". Please don't make a third one Christopher (you're still one of my favorite directors).Summary: go see it for it's spectacular actions and... that's it. Nothing more! (sorry)This is the required 10th line",0
"When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: ""It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?"". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see.The following comments contain spoilers. Be careful.The script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but? what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since ""Reservoir Dogs""). I've seen the ransom in China by plane (""Spy Games""). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance (""No Country for Old Men""). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in ""Seven"" and in the ""Saw"" saga). I've seen it all: ""The Dark Knight"" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The ""two ships dilemma"" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in ""Thank You for Smoking"". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since ""The Secretary"". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable. In ""The Dark Knight"", Evil is again the absence of values, but it's a minority, not the rule. So, we can fight Evil and defeat it, with or without super-heroes. But all those themes could be and should be explored better. ""The Dark Knight"" explores nothing.",0
"If I could give this movie less than a 1, I would certainly do that. I had read and heard so much about it that I was sure this would be a defining work of numbing minds to make a bad story look good with cheap tricks. I was game and we thought it can't be as bad as the critics said - you know critics. Sure enough... Give me a break with the awful acting (OK excluding Heath..), horrible camera work, poor use of the budget (that has been mentioned over and over again). I've seen better on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It's the Director and the Producer that makes films work - they choose the teams. That's it. If they don't put it together and make it work...it simply won't. So, they didn't - and it doesn't. Worst part is that I know this group can do good work... I just had to take the time to write this review...though I'm sure the film crew and the half crazed fans doesn't appreciate this review - I hope I'm doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well. Good luck. Final Word: The polar opposite of Batman Begin's awesomeness.",0
"I already wrote a review on ""The Dark Knight"", being full of anger and antipathy for that movie. But now I realized, that the best thing to do is: Help others to make a decision whether that praised film will awesomely entertain or simply shock them. I'll forbear from spoilers.""The Dark Knight"" wasn't the movie I expected. I thought it would be like ""Batman begins"" where people had motives for deeds and still surprising moments. Where Batman was a troubled character finding his way back to psychological stability, dealing with obstacles and fighting hard never to corrupt his morals. It wasn't. Considered soberly ""The Dark Knight"" was a complete surprise. It said: ""The journey's not over and it will not end, where you expect it to end."" Moreover, and that's also announced in the movie, the main villain has no motives. He's simply evil, loves to hurt and corrupt people and is, differently to what he proclaims, not a chaotic person, but an organizing and planning genius, almost (or I believe definitely) able to foresee the future.And here's the lack of the film: The Joker is unbeatable. Whatever Batman and the police try, the cannot defeat him. He's like a mythological god of chaos (owed to the writers), corrupting people with (I have to admit) known, but corrupting dilemma situations. And that's quite hard to bear. If you're a sensitive person, you'll sit there and suffer. If you're sensitive and intellectual, you'll simply understand that movie as a nightmare. And you should take that literally, because if you are, it's an unpleasant, annoying or even fierce situation, with ? what you call ? ""logic"" taken away.So if you're wondering whether to watch and you're a person like me, who believes that a movie either has to be realistic or if fiction has to contribute to giving you a good feeling or being a better person or something like that, DO NOT watch that movie. You will go out and have to deal with a serious quarrel about these (I believe fake) ""teachings"" you saw in that movie.For all the others, please take my advice. I have to admit that I am maybe a bit too sweet-tempered or something, but please don't take that movie too serious. In movies (the too positive ones) I often caught myself believing what happened there without reflecting. Please DO NOT do that here. It's a negative movie, destroying the super hero legend, having been established in ""Batman Begins"", surrendering to the believe that anyone can be corrupted and will be corrupted unless they die first.Thanks for reading.",0
"I feel sorry for Heath. He has always been interesting and brings a light to the screen. Like Brandon Lee in The Crow, his horrible legacy is to be remembered as an evil, lisping, greasy villain in this uninteresting, worthless film.What a waste. What a waste of time, What a waste of money, what a waste of talent. Don't waste your time. Remember Heath Ledger for the excellent parts he has played in other films, and don't be taken in by the hype and shameless promotion of this actor's untimely death. The length of the film is obnoxious- the story could have been told in one third of the time. I just kept waiting for it to end.",0
"I'm not sure why people think it's so great.A lot of people talk about this being Heath Ledger's last movie. People... not only was he working on another movie... THAT Movie had decided to use his footage, so when it comes out THAT will be his last movie.Do people think it is ""dark"" because it is mistakenly believed Heath Died because of this movie? (Even though it has already been proved to not be true.)Cause I've seen cartoons that are ""darker"" theme wise. Last night I saw an anime on Scifi that was more twisted than this movie. This movie really wasn't as dark and twisted as they made it out to be... and considering most of the violence is suggested rather than seen, People can't say this is the most violent movie out there.Also, why did the guy who played batman feel he had to talk as if he had Laryngitis or Bronchitis or something? Every time he talked when he was in ""Batman"" costume, people started giggling.Another problem was that it went on FOREVER. It went on and on and on and on. I walked out. I'm not sure how much longer there was to the movie. But once the Joker was caught by Batman, and you thought it was coming to an end... in comes ""two Face"" with Commissioner Gordon's kidnapped family. I had had enough by then.The plus sides: I like Michael Caine. Glad to see him in the movie.I have always had a crush on Gary Oldman The makeup they did on Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) after he became 2-face was brilliant.And I liked what they did with the joker, to a point. But for what it was, Heath did a good job.However, I have to give this movie an over all D.It was too long, Too boring, Too long, Too hyped, and Give Batman a cough drop for pete's sake!!",0
"This film wasn't awful - it was pretty decent. But the rating isn't for the film itself, but as a counter to all those who have over-rated it. Were it not for the exaggerated response to the movie (through people's want to have seen something great, rather than to have actually witnessed it) then a rating of 6 feels right. Film is over-long, doesn't sufficiently build characters to the point where we care what happens to them, relies heavily on shocks, crashes, bangs and gadgets, and is probably best suited to teenage boys who are already Batman fans. Spiderman and Batman (the original) were better movies, and this feels more like James Bond (without the humour) than a standout classic.",0
"This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still can't say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldn't see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super hero's outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldn't even move properly in it,(heck, he couldn't even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????)I'll tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood.Sure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat.Dark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasn't. Disappointment? You betcha'a!Long Live Jack Nicholson.",0
"I know this is pointless since it will be in 3,000 other reviews and no one will ever read it but, whatever. Anyways, on with the review. OK, I'll admit it. When I went and first saw this movie in the theatre, I thought it was amazing. I even did what other people did and started quoting the joker all the time (and good lord did that get burnt out REAL fast.). But then I bought the movie and kind of thought to myself, you know what, I should actually try to analyze this movie as a whole and not just pay attention to one persons performance(aka Heath Ledger.). So I sat down and watched it and I realized. Holy crap this movie is bad, REALLY bad, I did not realize how many plot holes this dang thing had, and the fact that it is in IMDb's top 10 best movies of all time is just insane. Look, I'm sorry Christopher Nolan fans but, I have to give you the gods honest truth. This movie is not top 10 worthy. I think the only reason why this movie has such a high rating is because of obsessive Heath Ledger fans and the Christopher Nolan fans who can't stop sucking on his tit. They think he can do no wrong. Well that's what this movie is, wrong. I mean c'mon, you Christopher Nolan fans are telling me that you can honestly sit there and tell me this movie is better than these (and yes Dark Knight is currently ranked higher than all these movies I listed.): Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Terminator 2, The original Star Wars, American History X, The Lord of the Rings, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, The Matrix, The Silence of the Lambs, Citizen Kane and Full Metal Jacket? No, no, no, no, no, no, absolutely not. I'm sorry mister Nolan but, you're obviously really good at brainwashing your fan base. That's the only explanation I've got is that Christopher has discovered how to hypnotize people and he can do it very well. It's ratings on movies like this that really make me think about how stupid society is nowadays. I'm sorry if I sound a little aggressive in this review but, I honestly feel this movie does not deserve the HUGE spotlight that everyone gave it.",0
"The Batsuit can deflect bullets, but it can't withstand a dog attack? Holy Wardrobe Malfunction! If I were Bruce Wayne, I would have kicked Morgan Freeman's backside back to The Electric Company, and sued the crap out of the firm that made the material that was supposed to protect my richer-than-God self from the likes of Cujo! But then, that would make way too much sense, and ""sense"" is something that the Batman franchise has never been accused of having!Say what you will about Tim Burton's and Joel Schumacher's Batman movies: at least they never pretended to be anything other than silly popcorn flicks. Christopher Nolan, on the other hand, wants to be Ingmar Bergman when he grows up -- which is why he rips off Burton! Don't tell me that ridiculous standoff was a happy accident, Ledger grunting ""Come on, come on, hit me"" _ la Jack? Batman doesn't turn The Joker into roadkill because he has a moral code? Give me a break! And, for a self-proclaimed ""agent of chaos"", every one of The Joker's actions are oddly well-planned and executed. Memo to Nolan: look up ""chaos"" in the dictionary!Which leads me to Ledger. Since when does twitching like a coked-up Mexican jumping bean constitute acting? No disrespect, but let's be real: if he hadn't died, that truly morbid Oscar campaign wouldn't have sprung up, and he wouldn't have been nominated, much less, won. As I could never understand Ledger half the time because none of his directors had the balls to tell him to enunciate like a normal human being, he had to have been dubbed, because I actually understood every word he said!And it's ""close to the vest"", NOT ""close to the chest""! Idiots!",0
"The Dark Knight's extreme popularity must be due to saturation advertising, hype, the popularity of the Batman franchise, and a star-studded cast. Looked at objectively, it fails on a number of levels.SPOILER WARNING: This comment talks extensively about the plot of the movie.A) The script is full of illogical events. 1) Batman jumps out of a window on the 50th floor to rescue Rachel, catches her, and smashes with her onto a car in the street below, and they both walk away unscathed, despite the fact that no parachutes were deployed and no wings broke their fall. 2) The Joker somehow fills large places throughout the city with large oil canisters full of explosives, with no one seeing, including Gotham's largest hospital and two ferry boats, after advertising that these places would be targeted. 3) Midway through the movie, the white knight of justice, District Attorney Harvey Dent, does a 180 degree turn when his girlfriend is killed and becomes a psychotic killer, for no reason whatsoever. 4) Early in the movie, the Joker goes on a rampage and then makes demands and the entire city clamors not for his defeat but for all his demands to be met. 5) Dogs can bite through the bulletproof bat suit. 6) Two Rottweilers can take down and immobilize Batman. 7) The Joker can singlehandedly overpower Batman without any weapons. 8) The police act as buffoons throughout the movie: they put the Joker in a cell with other prisoners; interrogate him without handcuffs; let him out of the interrogation room when he takes the interrogator hostage; and give him a cell phone to use, which he then uses to trigger an explosion in the building that kills everyone but, miraculously, him. 9) The Joker drives alongside a police caravan and systematically picks off one police car after another with a bazooka, and the police continue driving along at the same plodding pace. 10) Batman shoots at the Joker and fights him and flips his 18-wheeler truck, but when he is about to hit the Joker with his motorcycle, he crashes it instead and puts himself at the mercy of the Joker in a fit of GI Joe morality. 11) Morgan Freeman objects to Batman's cell phone mapping technique, saying ""Too much power for one man"", and resigns as his assistant, despite Batman's lifelong pursuit of lawless vigilantism.B) Aesthetically the movie is unimaginative and uninspiring. 1) Batman as a fighter is stiff. His suit is like a slab of sheet metal welded together. His movement is the opposite of the smooth, flowing martial artist one sees in classic samurai or judo movies. Batman arrives without stealth, by smashing through windows into hails of gunfire, and departs in a similarly unstealthy manner. This is the opposite of how a ninja would behave: with intelligence, grace, simplicity, and secrecy. Similarly, the Batmobile smashes through reinforced concrete walls and sits still to absorb a hail of gunfire. The Batman envisioned here -- smashing everything in his path, and indestructible -- is more like the Incredible Hulk than a bat. 2) Set design is drab. The scene in the kitchen, of the conference of mafiosi, is plain, uninspired, and unimaginative. The parking garage scene is aesthetically dull. The bat cave is quite plain -- just a long, empty room with a low, internally lit ceiling, without any gear whatsoever.C) The casting is poor and the acting uninspired and sloppy. 1) Morgan Freeman is a dreadful choice. His acting and presence is like the feel-good music that often accompanies his scenes. Just play the music and skip him. 2) Aaron Eckhart relies too much on his good looks and smile and not enough on acting. He sounds like a motivational speaker -- that is, a liar -- trying to convince, but unconvincing. His body language in the scene on top of the building is very fake: amateur-aggressive. 3) The actor playing Commissioner Gordon is about as good as a director standing in for an actor who couldn't make it to rehearsal. He has no energy or presence on screen. I appreciate understatement in acting, but he seems to be half asleep and mumbles his way through his lines. 4) Maggie Gyllenhaal is unconvincing as the object of desire of both heroes. 5) The black mafia boss is terrible. The other mafia bosses are not much better: overacting without direction or intelligence. 6) The man who turns from a meek bank supervisor to a tough vigilante in the first scene is too self-conscious, and his transition is unbelievable. He is too recognizable as an ""actor"". 7) The acting by extras is very bad and poorly directed. When the Joker says ""half"", the chorus of laughter is like that in a high school musical. The same unanimity of action is found at the press conference. The thugs in the parking garage seem like models, not thugs.D) The editing is too fast; transitions are largely dispensed with altogether. 1) There is no pause before the cut to the trial; dialogue from the two scenes runs together. 2) The scene at the benefit party is unconvincing: Bruce Wayne drops the models immediately, people applaud immediately, it's over. Scenes are too fast and perfunctory.E) In its larger themes, the movie proves to be just as illogical and perplexing as in its minutest details. The end of the movie carries this message: ""Sometimes the truth isn't good enough ... Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded."" This is used to justify the creation of a myth of Harvey Dent as ""Savior Of Gotham"", and to explain the need for making Batman the fall guy for all of Dent's crimes. However, the movie makes no attempt to explain why Dent, the psychopath, should be eulogized and not Batman, the hero. The writer floats a thesis about the human need for myths on a raft of unpersuasive evidence.",0
"The only list this movie should be at the top of is ""Most Overrated"". When I wasn't dozing off, I was hoping a fire alarm would evacuate the theater. I won't jump on the Heath bandwagon because he's six feet under. He was AVERAGE. To quote another review, if Heath gets nominated for an Oscar, I will never watch another Hollywood movie again.Plot holes the size of the grand canyon, overall terrible acting, and about 45 minutes of useless fluff at the end. Had this been the real world, The Joker would have been caught about 15 minutes into the movie and the credits would have rolled. Too bad that didn't happen.I will not be seeing the next Batman in the theater. That I can guarantee.",0
"I have to admit that I am writing this comment, just because of pure amazement. I am baffled, I am sorry. But the reason for the superb ratings, this Batman movie has received, is beyond my imagination.In my opinion it is a good comic movie, not a great one and definitely not a masterpiece.The acting is almost non-existing. That does not mean that the actors are bad. It just means that there was no space for acting.Christian Bale does his best, but his performance as an actor is just a faint shadow of what he can actually perform. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are simply wasted.Heath Ledger is offered more freedom when it comes to acting. He does the Joker in a nice way, crazy at times, funny at times and sometimes he looks like a guy who protests against the WTO. He is good, but does he surpass Jack Nicholson? Definitely not, and the same applies if you compare this batman edition with the first Burton Batman.There are still too many flaws and weak points in the movie. The list would easily crack the word limit.Nonetheless it is still a good, sporadically a very good comic movie. So if you are a die hard-comic fan, then you will probably like it. If you think that comic movies are the masterclass of movie making, then you can call this movie a masterpiece.From my point of view, if anybody asks me which good movie I have seen recently, then I can easily name two or three better films, that I have watched during the last month. And even those are far away from being called great.",0
"Back to the movie, clearly the actors are first rate and the dialog is entertaining. I particularly enjoy the incarnation of The Joker by Heath Ledger, which may bring Heath a posthumous Oscar nod; the writers give him some clever lines... like the ""you complete me"" phrase in the above quote (from Jerry MaGuire). But you know what I'm not buying? I'm not buying that this Batman flick, because of it's dark humor, is better than other comic-book-inspired movies; aside from the rare Joker line, nothing in this movie is humorous, dark or otherwise. In fact it's uncommonly depressing. I suppose Knight is similar to the later Spider Man films, in which we're to solemnly consider the deep emotional conflicts presented to a post-pubescent boy who has been given superhuman powers.My friends, these are movies (and movie advocates) that take themselves way too seriously. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008",0
"I never write reviews for movies, good or bad, but seeing this movie in the top 250 list makes me mad. Its just a movie for teenagers who don't question why things happen when they just don't make sense.I went to see this movie with great expectations because my brother told me it was great. But after the first five minutes I knew what kind of movie I as was about to ""suffer"".One cliché after the other with no characters development, nothing ""Gothic"" anywhere, and nothing ""dark"" or mysterious about this ""talking batman"" either. Also, I don't see anything great about the joker interpretation. For me Leger was just ""ok"". No need to glorify an actor because of his death. The other actors were just as terrible as the script allowed them to be. I really don't remember one minute of believable conversation between any of the characters.For a movie to be great, it needs, at least, to make sense. Its not that you cannot have explosions or great action. But this film reminds me more of a Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs can be anywhere when he wants to and pull anything out his sleeve.I don't want to mention anything specific to avoid spoilers, but just expect a ton of ""non-sense"" action from a bunch of ""Bugs Bunny"" characters.Its sad how 100,000 people cannot see beyond the special effects and tell themselves, ""that doesn't make sense, he was in that other ten places 5 minutes ago!!!"".",0
"Instead of questioning Capitalism, Communism, Taoism or Existentialism... and challenging the audience... it is about corruption and surrendering to corruption like surrendering to jaded teen boredom. Fueled by the claustrophobic helplessness due to terrorism, and the merciless acceptance of hipster nihilism, TDK is a cold unrealistic mechanical set-up sold over and over again by it's proponents as ""ultra-realistic"". That is the most frightening thing about the obsessive if not immoral blatherings of TDK fans is the Emperor's New Clothes insistence that the film represents ""realism"". From the Joker's precision timing to drive a school bus into a line of school buses, with one space left for him... to Dent's facial damage due to 5 seconds of burning gasoline... the film is rife with movie fakeness sold like Ad (or ADD) pitchmen for ""Nolan's formulaic realism"", which is actually just him stealing from ""The Long Halloween"".A meaningless Rube Goldberg contraption, Nolan takes the audience on an endless set of fake-out twists and turns to deliver very little but loud moments. As calculated and obsessive as The Joker is, and to the degree he plans about 5 separate ""back up plans"" that come to fruition, he enters the level of anal retentive... yet somehow we are to believe he is some ""agent of chaos"". Which, means cool. Chaos = cool, get it? There's nothing cool or chaotic about this drugged out riffing Joker, and as fun as Ledger makes him, he overshadows what should have been the center of the story: Harvey Dent. But it's Batman so, business as usual... problem child villain acts up, makes a mess, BatDad shows up to clean up the mess. Crowd applauds. Unfortunately what the film creates is a subtext of a NeoCon wetdream with ""by any means necessary"" militarism, where the Batman uses unethical means to ""detect"" the Joker, and we are to assume this fall from grace makes him heroic because he is banished and falsely accused (for 1 minute of nagging by the Joker, turning Dent evil for yet another film coincidence) of driving Dent from white to dark knight... so Batman takes the blame and is the dark knight cuz he's just a Christ figure. So our sacrificial Justice League hero is supposed to be a sympathetic figure of crossing moral boundaries to save society... George Bush must have loved this puppy. Not sure half the tween tards watching this caught that bit of hooey, but as much as the poster art evokes Fight Club, this film is about as far from punk anarchy as you can get. Maybe they should all be sent to military school if this is their idea of rebellion.",0
"Finally got to see this - I was disappointed. I haven't been this bored in a movie in quite awhile (not since Titanic at least). Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker was fine, but come on, I hate to say this, but are people saying his performance was a ""tour de force"" because the performance was so outstanding (it wasn't) or because he died prematurely (it was). The movie was dark, plodding, and overly long. There were some tense moments (ie: the ferry boats), and some of the twists and turns were interesting enough, but not enough to sustain this dank, overloaded barge. Time is always the true test of worth, and like Titanic, this movie will not hold up.",0
"Ledger gives a powerful performance as the joker, but the rest of the movie was a bit out of focus. Surprisingly the movie revolves around Harvey Dent. ""The White Knight"" Unfortunately Eckhart was bland as Harvey Dent and his fall to the dark side was almost corny. Shame really as this was Harvey Dent's story rather than Batman's. Speaking of which, I have never seen Christian Bale act this poorly. The man is one of the greatest actors of his generation and now his performance was totally uninspired. The Batman voice is incredibly distracting and as Bruce Wayne he just sleepwalks through his scenes. I also noticed that he wasn't as buff as he was in Begins. In all honesty there wasn't much for him to do here though. The script simply doesn't give Batman much to do, other than fight and beat up people. Bruce Wayne is the billionaire Playboy and that's about it. Freeman and Cain virtually play the same character. They do it well but the cast is too bloated already so they don't get much screen time.Maggie Gyllenhaal was great. She was able to bring warmth to her portrayal of Rachel Dawes. But unfortunately we don't get to see much of her either.The philosophical themes in this movie are barely explored. Every hero turns into a villain? Or some such nonsense. Every firefighter will turn evil unless they die? Very shallow and laughable. Only Jokers nihilistic speeches were convincing. Every good hearted person either dies or gets horribly mutilated. And then turns to evil. Batman beats prisoners and brakes peoples legs. Why so violent? Then you have your boring action sequences, the mandatory car chases and numerous explosions. The Dark Knight is actually an action movie much like Die Hard. Only the nihilistic philosophy sets it apart and gives it a unique flavor. If you are a big action movie fan you'll probably enjoy this movie. The Dark Knight isn't as good as Batman Begins. Batman Begins was a character study. How a traumatized young boy became a hero and how he turned his anger and fear into something positive. Here we see the hero corrupted by Joker. He is violent and angry. No longer a hero. He is willing to lie to the people of Gotham because they couldn't handle the truth. This sends a dubious message.In fact this movie has way more propaganda than your average summer blockbuster. Invading privacy, torturing prisoners and lying to the public.... But It's cool cause it's Batman. Kids wanna be like Batman and therefore Batman is cool even while torturing prisoners. Dark Knight could be viewed as legitimizing Dick Cheney's War on terror. It's pretty disgusting. ""We have to work the Dark side...""- Mr Cheney said after 911. Batman agrees.",0
"I feel like Im in the Twilight Zone. Is this what passes for movies now? Since you are reading comments, stroll by the voter demographics. Highest ratings are in the youngest age group. Thats not to say all young people are voting 10/10, thank goodness. Some are smart enough to have seen older movies and cant believe the INSANE over hype, but too many just weren't around for the good stuff - before overuse of CGI, or back when there was actually a plot, the characters were developed or there were plausible reasons for things. Do people honestly think this is perfect? Will it be remembered as a classic 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now? No. The more I think about it the more irritating it becomes. In the grand scheme of things, who the hell cares what movies it beats out because those classics *did* survive decades upon decades and this is just temporary infatuation. What gets on my nerves is that movies were doing so well for so long. People cared about making quality entertainment... for the most part. Its hard to put my finger on it because I kept dozing off during the movie, but the Dark Knight is really flawed, and to think (that with this undo attention) that this will set the new trend trend for how movies are made is agonizing to anyone that lives for movies. Thanks a lot Nolan. I think now Ill take up drinking as a hobby.",0
"After I was done watching this movie, I was sitting there waiting for it to begin. There was no story. There was nothing for viewers to hope to happen or not to happen. Unbearably trite performances all around. Can Morgan Freeman play anything other than Morgan Freeman? I was waiting for the scene when he tells Batman that he is really God and that Batman has to be God for a day, i.e. Batman Almighty.We're given no reason to care about anything that happens to any of the characters. This was a classic example of weak screen and story writing covered up by special effects, explosions, and other eye candy. The only thing redeeming about it was some decent ambiance and directing, but in that regard, it did not live up to Batman Begins. Nolan is past the point in his career where he has something to prove. The love is gone and it's showing in a big way.The Batmobile was fun to watch, but that hardly makes a movie.Please look past the special effects and give this movie the rating it deserves. Make Nolan and other film-makers do more than throw gobs of money at ILM to make a movie.",0
"My husband and I waited hours to see this movie (my stepson loves all the old Batman series and we do, too!) to finally find a few seats in the third row. What a disappointment! For 45 minutes, we endured bad action scenes with no apparent plot. The Joker's makeup was cool, but we were not impressed with Batman. His voice was like he was speaking from one of those box things for guys with throat cancer. I also wasn't impressed with the technology of the Batman suit. I guess our expectations were just too high. To be fair, we may try renting the movie another time (and sitting through the whole thing!) in the distant future.",0
"I have no clue what everyone else sees in this. I thought it was just another forgettable 2000s action movie with unappealing aesthetics. It's not even the best superhero movie of 2008 (Italian Spiderman beats it hands down). I prefer the 1960s version of Batman. (Update: looks like I already pissed off 5 fanboys. Well, I hope you're all crying in your parent's basement. Camp 1 : realism 0).",0
"This movie was given way too much credit. It was not as good as people said it was. The only good thing about it was Heath Ledger. This was the best performance of his tragically short life. He was amazing as the Joker, and extremely frightening. The rest of the movie was a waste of my time, though. The other actors were sub par, and the story was unoriginal. That really annoyed me because of how people were RAVING about it. This movie is not worth your time, don't listen to the people saying 'Oh, The Dark Knight is great, it's the best movie ever', because that is not true. I actually don't know if I was watching the same movie as those people, as the movie I saw was total garbage, almost but not quite saved by one absolutely stellar performance.",0
"I sat down with this movie after knowing that most people loved and seemed to venerate it. But I have a lot of perspective. I was reading Batman comics back in 1957, and I have seen all of the greatest movies ever made. This just isn't one of them. I did not care about anyone. The action was remorseless and unnecessary, one could even say gratuitous. I even turned it off by the 2-hour mark because it got so maudlin and disjointed. I did read something about people voting this into fifth position of the greatest 250 movies ever made, and clearly this shows the weight of current voters who have little experience with good movies. Why, they should be asked, does Citizen Kane, a 1941 movie always rank as the best movie ever? Because it had story, wonderful acting, human nature, and on and on, all things missing from Dark Knight.Movies today are thrown together with lots of action, preposterous stories, and computer effects. Characters survive falls and bangs that would put anyone, including a linebacker for the NFL, in hospital for a week or more. As with another reviewer, I am now finding it hard to remember to much about this movie, but I can remember every scene in a great movie, like The Maltese Falcon, etc.",0
"Christopher Nolan is a simple, discreet, hard-working man. His work on Memento was made with great talent and The Prestige is a pleasant movie. Unfortunately this is not the case with his batman movies. ""Begins"" has many defects (mainly Katie Holmes) but it is not bad. This is just an average movie with no chance to date in film history. The Dark Knight seems to have been made by a pretentious man (a pretentious crew, at most). The major lacks of the movie is a dense scenario with no rhythm and no emotional implication and a flabby direction. After the two third of the movie, I was actually blunted and the only thing that I wanted to see was ""The End"" on the screen. Because I didn't care of the fate of the batman or the commissioner Gordon or Harvey Dent and because the story slacks from the beginning to the end. I don't think that Nolan was the good choice for such a movie, and excepting the early 90's McTiernan, I can't see what director would now be good enough to make this ambitious movie. Hiring a talented script-writer wouldn't have been bad for the sake of the movie, and a director who knows the making of good action scenes (but not like the bad Michael Bay). Nevertheless, The Dark Knight has some qualities : the actors are good, particularly Heath Ledger, and it's better than nothing.",0
"How many times does a crook have to be caught and released over several boring hours to make a movie feel dynamic? Spoilers - if Joker has so few people in his 'gang' (especially if he goes around killing them on a regular basis), how does he get the large set pieces sorted out exploding buildings and boats etc! Yes it was fantasy that much is clear - but rushing from set piece to set piece drama, tension, explosion is poor production technique. But a 9.1 rating over 270,000 voters - this will be a lone voice probably in the love fest that has occurred around this title. Please no Oscar nominations. Glad I got that off my chest.",0
i have never been so bored the plot was totally predictable and it just never seemed to end it kept going on and on and on. the best bit was when the love of Batman's life died. my husband and i both nearly walked out cos it was so boring. the amount of times that the joker was caught was unprecedented and the heroes just had no brains about them as to what he would do next it took 3 of them to catch him and then he still got away. personally preferred Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the joker and as for batman what is with that fake voice? This is the worst film i have seen in a long time. as for it being a 12a who's idea was that? it should be a 15 so a warning to all parents. anyway don't waste your life wait till it is the DVD clearance shelf at woollies.,0
"I give it one star because of the headache-inducing over-storyboarded and dull midsection. A botched directorial effort by Nolan.1. Mid-point scenes of Harvey Dent character w/ Maggie Gyllenhall, scenes of Commissioner Gordon & cops etc. slowed movie down drudgingly with boring back-story- needed 20 minutes shaved off.2. Batman fight scenes had elbow jabs galore and looked like a blur.3. Choppy story editing in first half of movie swung from action scenes to modern high-rise scenes back and forth like a yo-yo. Felt like I was going up and down an express elevator- gave me a headache.4. Not enough Joker in first half. (see first aspect) 5. Two-face should've lived, but the special FX on him were overkill.6. The mayor, played by a too-young and effeminate looking actor with obvious mascara, looked ridiculous.",0
"Some things I will never understand. Women, why we exist on earth, and the massive praise this film has received since its release in 2008. The Dark Knight is truly overrated. For starters, Bale's Batman voice is laughable and distracting. It's horrendous. The score of this film is so tedious it feels like one giant trailer, it fails to recognize suspense. The film itself is a wannabe gangster film and it's very boring. I will give it to Nolan though, he may very well be a genius. He made a comic book film as close to real life as possible, which I theorize caused so many people to praise the film itself to be genius. It was something very different. But that's not enough to make a movie ""the best movie of all time"", as I've heard it being referred to. I've tried countless times to give this movie a chance. Over and over struggling to find out why it's held so high. I cannot say that I simply dismissed it, I've actually tried. And yes, I'm fully aware of Heath Ledger's performance and that it was a key element of this film's praise and success. And yes Ledger was terrific, that's apparent. His annoying tongue tick aside and tiring faux ""you wanna know how I got these scars"" stories, he became the Joker. But that just wasn't enough for me, the film isn't a masterpiece, not even close. It's almost as bad as your typical action film. You know what, who is anyone kidding, this is a typical action movie with Batman. I don't care about the characters, there's too many distractions. I am still in search for someone who will agree with me, as it seems that everyone holds this film to a high standard.",0
"Yes, the special effects were amazing. In some ways it's the modern day's Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The plot was predictable,boring, and extremely long. I saw it in theatres and had to force myself to stay to the end. Yes, Heath Ledger was good. A playful psycho. But the film itself is something I'd have to be tied down to see again.So much of the accolades this film had seems based on Heath Ledger's death. It would be interesting to know how the reviews would be if not for that tragedy.I suspect the next generation would look back on this film and say ""boring"".",0
"2 and a half hours!!!!! are you kidding? that time is reserved for great movies, not crap like this. oh yeah, movies must have a lot of ""action"", flashing lights and special effects along with gadgets. Of course batman always had the gadgets, but the fight scenes were pathetic, and the special effects made for 14 year old. ""dude did you see that.....! no sense of where batman comes from, and the joker, why not show some of his childhood instead of him just telling it. noisy and juvenile. lousy effects and stunts. 2 and a half hours!!!!! are you kidding? that time is reserved for great movies, not crap like this. oh yeah, movies must have a lot of ""action"", flashing lights and special effects along with gadgets.

"Even for a blockbuster cotton candy movie, this is a piece of crap. Got a script that makes so sense, characters that you don't care about and mindless violence and unbelievable set pieces.How do you know the joker is a guy that just likes to see things burn? why first Alfred tells us that and if you didn't get it the first time, the joker then tells us he just likes to see things burn and sure enough if that was too subtle for you, he then sets things on fire! Then there is the fact that keep on calling him a terrorist when he goes on about how he only care about chaos. First of all a terrorist is a person who acts because they do have a strong belief not because they have no beliefs. Terrorist do the things they do with a goal in mind, they are in fact the total opposite of the Joker character.Then you have a film that's basic message is hey sometimes it's OK to lie and pretend someone is a hero when they aren't. Wow what a wonderful things to support, I'm sure George W. bush loved this film.Then there is the acting. how hard is it to play completely crazy, not that damn hard, just because Health Ledger is dead, doesn't mean his acting is suddenly good. He was not a great actor and he sure isn't in this film.Too long, so boring.",0
"I finally finished watching this movie on DVD, and it was a big disappointment. It was very poorly made and very poorly written. The believability factor is almost zero. If the film was going for fantasy, fine, but it is seeking realism. There are many aspects of the movie which are completely unbelievable. While the Joker can not catch the armoured truck with bazookas and taking down a helicopter, somehow he could catch and tie up two of the main characters. How? We don't know. We weren't shown that. But he did it! In the scene where the helicopter is taken down, the armoured truck turned randomly from the underground passage to a street. So how did the Joker's men know which street to be on? Speaking of his men, where do they come from? Since he proves himself willing to kill and discard his own guys on a whim, why does anyone continue to work for him? What kind of mob boss shows up for the money with almost no guys? But the joker, who burns their money, he has lots of guys. This is the school of film-making where you can just write whatever you want. It's very apparent. That makes for a rather pathetic viewing experience. Near the end where Dent explains his motivation: I could not believe a film of such supposedly high calibre reached like that. It's like a kindergarten melodrama. And notice the two choices, either him or Batman. Why not Mr. X? Or Ms R? Or the Joker? No. No. We're writing this script the way we want to: stupidly.And by the way, you kill the Joker. Dead. Again, we see more and more in the pathetic school of film-making that has become somewhat dominant, the bad guys aren't killed, they just fall off a cliff, or stumble, or something. Why give the audience the satisfaction of watching this piece of crap buy a bullet.",0
"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!!! It has nothing to do with Batman and especially Joker!!!Joker is supposed to be a crazy,obsessed with money and vengeance villain who had an accident with chemicals! Not just an anarchist who doesn't like organizations and money and looks like homeless, with paint all over his face and some scars!Two-Face isn't supposed to die, he is supposed to be playing in another movie.And come on now, more people know who Batman is except Alfred, Batgirl and Robin?I am telling you this is not Batman.",0
"I think its adorable that certain members of an unspecified generation find ""The Dark Knight"" (aka Batman 2) to be a Masterpiece of Contemporary Cinema. Is 'adorable' the right word? Christian Bale reprises his role as the humorless comic-book hero and Heath Ledger joins the cast as the humorless comic-book villain ironically named ""Joker."" Ledger's ""Joker"" is about as much fun as an emergency spleenectomy, which means to say he never laughs, never makes anyone laugh, and never jokes. Are we having fun yet? The film takes place in the same Gotham City from the previous film: flat, bleak, black, dark, foreboding, menacing, pessimistic, intense, sinister, colorless, numb, petrified... is this the fun part? Bale- an otherwise fascinating actor- manages to create a black hole as both Bruce Wayne AND Batman, leaving the audience without any protagonist for whom to cheer. Christopher Nolan's solemn direction is the same as in the first- he's working so hard to convince us that all of this is ABSOLUTELY REAL that there is no chance for any fun. Fun in a superhero movie? I must be out of my mind.What's sad is that poor Heath Ledger took the role of Actual Psychotic so seriously that it contributed to the man's death. No film role is worth your life, and if playing the villain in a comic book movie messes with your mind, you're doing it wrong. No offense to the late actor- whose performance here would have been great in a dramatic or psychological film- but Jack Nicholson nailed The Joker in '89. It was nice of the Academy to give Ledger the posthumous Oscar, but I think we all would have preferred he not die before his time.This is not to say the movie is terrible... it's still an above-average action flick with some nice moments: the sunset prison transfer is beautifully done and the scenes at Wayne's cocktail party border on subversive, but the generally dour approach to the popcorn-flick leaves me depressed, and I can't help returning to the thought that a man gave his life for this...Maybe that's what certain members of an unspecified generation want... maybe the Imagination is so damaged they don't believe a movie character is killed unless an actor really dies. I find the death of creative thought rather frightening, and I keep coming back to an old horror catchphrase: ""It's only a movie, It's only a movie..."" GRADE: C",0
"You have got to be kidding me! My husband and I decided to watch this piece of garbage on New Year's Eve instead of a marathon of The Office. Boy did we make the wrong choice. How do people like this ""film""? What has happened to artistic integrity and plain old good taste. The plot was disjointed, confusing, and ridiculous!! The direction was horrid. Even the actors who many I respect all looked like a bunch of sell outs who were in it for the paycheck. Gary Oldman are you joking? One of the greatest actors - what a horrible role. Could you not keep your English accent out of Gotham when you raised your voice? Don't you learn how to do that in acting 101? The highlight of the movie is when Rachel blows up. Sorry to be morbid but talk about a bore - that Maggie girl should take some lessons from her at least competent brother. Can anyone explain the plot in 1000 words or less? Unbelievably all over the place. Heath Ledger did a good job as the Joker, but please don't tell me this role drove him to emotional torment and insomnia. I have great respect for him as an actor and feel so sad for his death. I just don't understand what was so dark about the dark knight. Batman should definitely hang up his suit.",0
"Too much hype to take this film serious. People were crazy about this film even before it released. Talk of an Oscar for heath ledger before this film hit theaters. Will respect to heaths death but i think his death gave this film a bigger boost and expectation. Once the film came out i didn't find it that much different than any other action film. it was just one explosion after another. The performances were strong by everyone except for maggie gyllenhaal. Though better than katie holms performance doesn't mean it was a good one. There was something that bothered me about Christian bales voice when he was batman. As bruce wayne it was normal but when he was batman it was a complete change to a lower aggressive voice that didn't even sound like bales voice at all. it sounded bad. Then there is heath ledger, it was not a bad performance at all in fact it was rather great at times. He took the joker character to an all time low and gave it a more sadistic gruesome feel but to discredit what Jack Nicholson did for the character 19 years ago is not right. Jack gave heath a blue print on how to play the character and heath took it to another level. I really don't think its Oscar worthy like everyone is preaching for but it is a fine job by ledger. I really don't understand why fans are treating this like the second coming of Christ or something, calling it the best film ever, a masterpiece, the greatest super hero movie ever, it should knock Titanic of the top of the box office cause its a better movie. its all a little premature if you ask me. If degrading other movies or other actors to make this film look good is people best review of the Dark Knight then they are pretty closed minded. The dark Knight is a damn good action film, nothing more nothing less",0
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.This movie made me tired.",0
"I tried to get through this. Really I did. And I could appreciate the effort that went into the performances and the wads of dough that must have been spent on special effects. The atmosphere too is lucidly rendered -- night time in the big city.But my enjoyment was hampered by the fact that I'd outgrown most of this stuff about the time I entered High School, and that was when the comic-book Batman still looked like a human being, not a bemuscled behemoth.The experience, the viewing of this, as much of it as I could stand, was exhausting. You have never seen so many vehicles, large and small, racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal.The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain.It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance. At least in the comic books you had to READ the dialog bubbles. Here, no challenge at all. Just sit back and let the despondency overwhelm you.I know, I know. I missed the point. It's just a fantasy. Right enough, but it's somebody else's fantasy, not mine.",0
"Is most of humanity on serious drugs? This film is a mess. The script rambles, the characters come in and out of the film for no reason, no one does anything that makes any sense. This was written using a Vegetamatic The writing is bad!! This NOT a good film and yet the population heads for that cliff like Lemmings. Have the studios turned our brains to mush? BATMAN BEGINS is GOOD... This is BAD. OK, so Heath Ledger does a good job in the film... that still doesn't make it a good movie. Demand better!! Seriously... Now. Put that potato chip bag down, call the Office of Homeland Security and tell them Jihaadists have taken over Warner Bros. and are pretending to be David Goyer (a great writer most of the time). He must be being held captive by the guy impersonating Paul McCartney. Is putting on a black cape and some cat ears all it takes to amuse the populace... This is down right Orwellian.. God Help us!!",0
"I am sincerely confused by all the hype around this movie. It just didn't seem that great to me. No characters had any personality or motivation whatsoever, except the Joker. There was no plot structure at all... the entire thing was just the Joker threatening to kill people and everybody freaking out, then repeat, then repeat again. No break in the action, no climax. And all this for at least two hours. By the end I was TRYING to fall asleep.Not to mention the really, really stupid plot devices. (If you don't care to hear my rant/list of these, which may include SPOILERS, skip to the next paragraph!) Being able to remotely transform all cellphones into high-resolution sonar devices? This idea is just stupid. Wayne chooses ""taking a boat ride with the entire Russian ballet"" as an alibi? Because somehow he trusts all these near-strangers enough not to blow his cover? That entire plot device was clearly an excuse to fit in at least one scene with scantily-clad women. And the Joker escapes from jail because they didn't bother to put his handcuffs back on after Batman took them off. How lame is that? As soon as he got into jail it was obvious he'd escape, because that's how these stereotypical plots always go, but I at least hoped it would be because of Joker's cleverness rather than because of a completely unrealistic and inexplicable lack of security. He was an infamously dangerous criminal, obviously an entire police station wouldn't be so lax around him. And when he holds his knife to an officer's neck to make demands, another officer about ten feet away is pointing a gun and has a clear shot at his head, and a reason to shoot, but he doesn't. Why not? This movie follows SO many other predictable plot stereotypes. Like the fact that as SOON as Harvey is disfigured, it's completely obvious that he is going to become a villain. Because you can't be disfigured without being evil... Only the handsomest of men are heroes. The most annoying thing is how they didn't even feel the need to explain his lighting-quick transition to being a supervillain with no convincing motivation except for showing his burns, because as soon as you saw that his face was burned you just knew he was evil, end of story. It's just like the way that as soon as you see a child in this movie, you KNOW that group of people won't die, because children never die, of course. The audience might be offended. Also, both protagonists are totally infatuated with some boring girl for no apparent reason, which is a pretty good sign that a movie isn't very thoughtful.Some of the ridiculousness and predictability of the movie's plot could have been forgiven if it wasn't so very tedious. Two hours of the exact same continuous action sequence with no breaks to allow for deeper plot or character development is just too much. Unless you like watching violence for its own sake regardless of plot, and have a really, really long attention span, I can't understand why you like this movie (and you probably do, everyone does, apparently). Not to mention that this long tedious action sequence mostly consists of the exact plot of the first half being reused as the second half (Joker's setup on the boat and the hospital were the same story, it's as if they couldn't decide which one to use and then thought ""hey, let's make this movie REALLY long and just use both of them, one right after the other..."").It did have some redeeming qualities. The joker WAS great, the nihilistic spin on his character was well-done. The beginning was relatively interesting, before they got into the repetitive action sequences. And toward the end they killed someone who I really didn't predict would die. But, I would never, EVER sit through this again.",0
"Those looking for some fun, a bit of entertainment, will be disappointed by The Dark Knight. It's almost as if the director is trying not to make a superhero film at all, its desperate attempts to make everything plausible and gritty ignoring the fact that the two protagonists are actually a mad clown and a man who dresses as a bat...Fair enough if you don't want to make a superhero film, but if you don't want to make said film please don't pick one of the most famous superheroes of all time to drag down into an overlong grim-fest with far too much standing around and discussion of the film's plot.As with the (superior) Batman of Tim Burton, once again the Joker dominates the film. The problem is that Ledger's Joker does not really play any jokes, have any gadgets, or try to make anyone laugh. The Joker should be scary AND funny, and Ledger fails in this regard. Bale's Batman is also portrayed as a thug, beating up an imprisoned Joker and dropping a villain out of a building. Isn't Batman supposed to be the 'World's Greatest Detective'? Isn't he supposed to use his brains and intelligence to outwit the villains, rather than just pounding them to a pulp? Perhaps this is a reflection of tactics deemed acceptable by the War on Terror but it isn't the Batman I admire.Dark Knight's claim to realism is also blown out of the water by the Joker's merry band of mental hospital patients (!) managing to install huge amounts of explosives in hospitals, ferries, offices etc without anyone noticing till the conveniently dramatic crucial moment. Finally, the Batman rescues the Joker from falling to his death, because, after all, Bats is a hero. Sadly this contradicts his actions in Batman Begins where he refuses to save Ducard from certain death on the stricken Gotham monorail.Overall, the film leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. For some viewers, the darker the better, and as a teenager I'm sure I would have loved this film. But if you want dark, watch a horror or a thriller, and leave superheroes alone to be larger than life. I'm not advocating a return to the days of the Joel Schumacher neon-nightmares, but this film should have allowed Batman to have a bit of fun, and be less of a thug.",0
"Sorry but this movie just doesn't do it! For me, the best Batman movie is in fact the first one with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson! But thanks to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, I stayed 'til the end of the movie. The other actors including Bale were very below average. I saw all superheroes movies, but the worst one is this one. At the top of my list is Spider-Man : it just got better and better since the first movie. Batman does not deserve to beat all those records at the box office. What a pity ! Iron Man was good, very good. The Incredible HULK was OK, but I prefer the first HULK (with Bana). I do not know, but for me, to be entertaining a movie needs to have a soul, which is not the case for Tha Dark Knight. Désolé, it's a bad movie. That is all I have to say.",0
"i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10.",0
"C'mon, folks.If Heath Ledger wins an Oscar for his performance, then the Academy has lost all sense of judgment.What film full of that kind of horror gets a PG 13 rating??? I have read most of the comments on this side of the balance and must concur with all that I have read. I just saw the movie ....just to see it for myself. And I wish that I had my money and time back. Too long...too gory...too much of everything negative. Did DC Comics intend for Batman to be portrayed in such a manner??? I think not.I really think something in wrong here in America.....when films like this get 9/10 stars.",0
"Okey I went to the cinema for this movie with the idea it was higher rated then the godfather and pulp fiction... Well i just registered to IMDb to say I was very disappointed about this movie. Just because the flaws in the movie some. Here are some really stupid things in the movie: 1. Batman can bend a gun barrel whit his bare hands. 2. Dogs can chew true batman Armour but bullets can't. 3. The Joker can do everything: 3.1 He drives a school-bus into a bank and drive away without being noticed by anyone. And the bus had no scratch on it. 3.2 He can get into everything even on a parade with 100 of cops and the cops just ignore him there not even thinking about where there college's are. (But cops don't think in this movie they just panic when 1 guy takes a shot at the mayor) 3.3 The hospital that is guarded by lot of cops, Joker just walked in, the explosives are just there and he just walked out and blows the whole place up. He gets on a school bus and vanished into fin air. 3.4 He has tons of explosives on ferries that are heavily overcrowded. 3.5 They lock him up with a personal guard but they also lock him up in a general jail. Did he wanted room-service on his jail or was the personal guard to prevent him from getting bored? (but again cops are stupid in this movie)I had a lot of moment in the movie with:'Just shoot the Joker!!!!!'. Gotham was not Gotham but some city in the USA. Batcave was some to big ugly place under the ground with to many lights. third degree burn wounds just put a blanked on it wait some days and its all good but ugly. And god he was in pain I really noticed that... Balistic testing with some big ass gun why do you need a machine gun to fire 1 shot at a time for testing. This movie is just bad.But there some good things one is the joker was good he missed some good Joker jokes but at least is was evil. And really that the best thing I have to say about the movie. I give it a 1 against all those who gave it a 10... normally I would give it a 6/10",0
"I saw batman begins and liked it although at the beginning i had a negative feeling. For the dark knight i went to the movies with the greatest expectations, after the big commercial that followed heath ledger's death everyone seemed to have liked it.What a disappointment that was. The movie is not bad but the critics make me hate it. Seriously i think that there are some movies ine the top #250 that are overrated but this one takes the cake....From where i have to start? the action scenes are nothing spectacular, even tim burtons movie had better ones... The music doesn't fit at the most of the sequences there's a repetitive tired to death theme that makes in almost every sequence( that's the feeling i had ). Batman's voice is like robocop is talking or something like that it's not even clear what he is saying in some points. I think it would be easier to say what i liked on this movie cause there are not many things i liked....Well heath ledger's acting was good although i think that jack nickolson's acting was more close to what i had in mind of joker character, more sarcastic and funny in a crazy way. Heath made a good bad guy but he is more serious than a joker should be, so why so serious?Avoid this movie there are a lot of better movies out there, it's just a trendy hype that i hope in some years will fade away.",0
"damn i cant believe the reviews for this film. I've only seen this twice and don't plan on seeing it again anytime soon, and this coming from a lifelong batman MOVIE fan (note the emphasis on MOVIE, not COMICS).I've seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels, even the ""campy"" Schumacher ones. but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction. JUST because batman & robin was terrible and silly doesn't make Christopher Nolan's films the comic book equivalent of the ""godfather"" or gone with the frigging wind. if anything, they only show how amazing Tim Burton's 2 original dual pictures are, and how utterly lame the Nolan ones are. not only is ""the dark knight"" worse then batman begins, its downright ridiculous! you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about. its like CSI meets Gotham city. you might as well call this movie GCPD or GCPD Blue, or any of those law and order-type shows that this movie seems to copy from. its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible. they seem to think ""if the story is engaging enough, we don't have to make the movie visually appealing"". thats like saying ""if the story is good enough, we don't have to make batman look awesome in the comics"".lets get this review started shall we? first, the joker. we are all familiar I'm sure with jack Nicholson's classic portrayal from the original film. it was truly amazing, he made the character eerie, funny, and charming all at once. yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously. this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role. but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with Nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters aren't really who they should be. first off, joker doesn't fall in a vat of acid like the original, he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green. i would hate to see his joker in the rain, he would look rather pathetic as a joker. i can guarantee that if Nicholson didn't already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film, fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with. oh, but since Nicholson already played THAT version to perfection, Nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that we've seen time and again. Heath didn't really even play the? Joker, he played ""generic serial killer bad guy #13314"". for those who would defend ledger by saying he was ""really scary and terrifying"", sure ill give them that, but to say he was better than NICHOLSON?!? JACK FREAKING NICHOLSON?!? PLEEEEEEEEEEASE!!! The role was virtually MADE for the man when he was born.? Nicholson captured the true essence of the Joker; a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing, but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs. THESE are traits that define the Joker, not some cliché ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us. and that brings me to another point, whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo-philosophic rambling monologues? boy Nolan LOVES these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time, even in the last film. its laughable at how serious he takes the movie. did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film? Tim Burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality. its somewhere right in the middle. Nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city. it makes him look silly and out of place.I'm not gonna dwell much on bales batman. this guy cant save any movie hes in. people seem to love this guy, or think hes some brilliant actor, but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his ""performance"" in this film. to quote Christopher walken from Batman Returns, ""hes just a poor schmo, who got lucky"". his batman voice is ludicrous. ludicrous! i still don't understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over. every time he talks he makes me laugh. the only decently done things in this film is how Harvey dent is portrayed (pre-twoface) and the pretty nifty bat pod, that has ONE cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile. but again, the action scenes never pick up because of Nolan's hard on for realism, so nothing in the new Batman films ever makes you go ""OOH Awesome"" for too long. this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end. they make it feel like the new Batman's are ""smart"" but honestly, in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out ""deep"" monologues? its so....meh. i'd rather watch jack Nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh. who can forget gems like ""bob, gun"". today you have ""why so serious?"". yeah thats what i want to know, why so serious Nolan?? why cant you make batman fun? nothing against having darkness, Burton's films were dark too but not so much to the point where they weren't fun or exciting. again, disappointed.",0
"This movie was OK, but it wasn't anywhere near as good as people claimed.Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was great, but his dialog, for the most part, was not all that interesting. I was having fun with him at first, especially when he told the story about how he got his scars (the first time anyway) But when he told that story the second time, I was not impressed. Once was more then enough.When it all comes down to it, this movie was simply OK, but because the death of Heath Ledger was such a shocker to the Hollywood community, this film got way more credit than it deserved, and that's all there is too it.",0
"After the excellent Batman Begins, I expected this sequel to be so much better, instead we are left with one big mess of a movie. Don't get me wrong, all the actors do a splendid job with their roles especially Heath Ledger (RIP), however the film itself is just not very entertaining at all. In fact, this is hardly a Batman movie itself, the film focuses more on cops and corruption, which is fine so long as you remember that your supposed to be watching a comic book hero.The problem here is there is too much going on, and with little explanation, the film starts to get very confusing, as you start to wonder who is really the hero and who is the villain. Batman's Gotham City now looks more like New York City, and his Bat cave is absolutely horrendous, not to mention his irritating voice.In its defence, the actors perform well, and some of the special effects are quite good, especially the opening scene where Batman kicks butt, only trouble is, its well too brief. If your going to watch The Dark Knight in terms of action, then you will surely be disappointed as there really isn't much action at all, only about fifteen minutes at the most.If you want a proper comic book superhero movie, I recommend Iron Man (a far more entertaining movie), or even the second Hulk movie with Edward Norton. Its just a shame, that this second Batman movie was not what I expected, and after the brilliant Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is a big disappointment. Take my advice; stick to the excellent Tim Burton classics, they are far more entertaining and faithful to the comics. Or just watch Batman Begins and skip the sequels.",0
"I know there were a lot of hype and excitement about this film, but I think it's the weakest in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects, high drama and a haunting music score, this film is too dark even for Batman. The plot drags, action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weak.As a fan of the comics, I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series. But, it wasn't meant to be.We have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs, but ended up facing a new villain, the Joker. Later on in the story, crime-fighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into Two-Face. While pretty good acting, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic. I didn't care for the make-up and costume as well. Aaron Eckhart's performance of Harvey Dent/Two-Face drove me off the wall - bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as Two-Face. I know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what we've went through with Schumacher's films, but the story is too serious and dark. I would highly recommend ""Batman Begins"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"" over this. While also dark, those two films had much better character development, compelling plots and a better balance of humor.Grade D+",0
"I don't know what film i saw - but i know i wasted 152 mins of my life.There's virtually nothing positive about this film Perhaps it's the over hyped that's ruined an average film.The film obviously suffered from the loss of Heath Ledger - though it's unclear at what point in the filming this happened (if at all). Maybe it's just been terribly scripted and badly edited.There's no suspense - every idea in the film has been seen before. I think the whole cinema sat in disbelief in how bad this film is - at the end there was only relief that it had finished.Caine is superbly cast as Alfred, Bale lacks from a poor script and a empty storyline, which is a shame, because Batman Begins was pretty good filmMaybe this film appeals the American audience - but on the opening night at my local cinema in N London - 99% of people walked out very disappointed",0
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.3/10",0
"Well, it's been a few years, but I might as well warn future moviegoers.This is the movie which so many critics and viewers raved about, yet I couldn't see what for. Let me explain:I'll be brief because I don't want to reveal too much of the plot. The film is basically where the Joker sets out to corrupt the Batman and to prove that 'chaos is order' through death and destruction, and Batman goes to his limits to defeat him. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne goes through an emotional crisis as Rachel Dawes is now dating Harvey Dent, who later is scarred and becomes Two-Face. It sounds good like this, but it's not.The two main leads are terribly irritating and not at all like the comic book and cartoon versions. Instead of a deformed, conniving, sinister clown, the Joker is a painted emo who preaches about chaos while he senselessly murders people to no apparent aim except to cause that Batman turn to the dark side. I'm not sure if his plan was to pretend to be crazy so that he could conquer the crime syndicate, because it never clearly states any actual goal of his. He acted like some generic psycho, not the real Joker, and I could get ten times better on Criminal Minds.Meanwhile, the Batman is constantly whining about how terrible his life is, and pining after Rachel, and several rushed scenes leave it ambiguous as to whether he wants to be Batman or not. It seems to be a poor rehash of Spider-Man 2, which did this story-line much better. The Batman is the one character in the superhero universe who sacrifices personal relationships for justice more than any, so this is an inherent contradiction of his character. The worst part of all this, though, is that he actually believes some of the Joker's moronic pseudo-philosophy, and acts as if he will somehow be exactly like the Joker and go around murdering people needlessly if he kills him. Really, though, Gotham would be better off if the Joker died, yet the Batman saves him even though, in the final fight, killing him is in self-defense. I didn't get any sense of the bitter rivalry between the two.The rest of the movie doesn't fare well, either. Harvey only becomes Two-Face later on in the second half, after the mob deforms him and kills Rachel. The Joker is responsible, of course, yet, he goes after a few corrupt cops and then Gordon's family. They give no back story to him or reason for his actions, and he is killed off accidentally by Batman. Plus, the love triangle angle is never fully developed anyway (although, because I never really liked her, I wasn't sad when Rachel died). Sal Maroni is a minor secondary villain, but gets more involvement than Alfred or Lucius (they're just minor roles here). Gordon is the only consistent and interesting character in the whole movie.The film is too dark (literally, because everything's in shadows), and the actions scenes, while sometimes good, are hard to see, and seems misplaced anyway. He travels to China to capture a mobster who's not really important, and destroys half of Gotham in a pointless chase scene. The Joker magically seems to be able to blow up bridges, a hospital and ferries, and hack into television broadcasting, without notice and with unlimited resources, but his acting makes this all too unbelievable. His idiotic master plan is to rig two ferries with explosives and see who blows who up first, and the Batman defeats him by magnetizing the city's cellphones to track him. And, in the end, the Batman pretends to be responsible for Harvey's crimes after the latter's death so that the Joker's doesn't win the battle for Gotham's soul (although he and Gordon commit corruption, so the Joker does win, anyway). The musical score is fine, but it's the same one from the last film.All in all, it's just boring and dull. All the philosophy was nonsense, and felt forced. They just used the Batman franchise to sell a film which would otherwise be panned by critics (so why it wasn't, I don't know). I don't recommend that you don't watch, but don't be sucked in by all the hype.",0
"Sorry guys, but this doesn't belong in the top 250's by any account. Its fight scenes, car chases, its effects, and its storyline were all mostly average. Momentum wasn't built up over the film at all, and worse, they dragged out scenes longer then they should have.In fact, this movie was in the top 250 list BEFORE it made it to cinema. Why? Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heath's death as a marketing tool, over-hyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it. Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldn't mean it should be voted any differently (would anyone have liked this movie if Batman's costume was swapped). Yes, heath was good because he played something out of his general character, similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind. But...9 and 10's should be reserved for movies which are completely innovative. I felt like I saw this movie 20x already, and nothing kept me hanging on to find out what happened next. People who voted this 10/10 possibly need to experience movies such as the shining, Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, Fight Club or even Wall-E. These are movies which provide the watcher with a different experience then what they are accustomed too, and they are left wondering what will happen next.",0
"1) A general comment...This movie typifies why I would like to see IMDb have a system that deletes user ratings every year for ten years after a movie is released (maybe keep the last years ratings and delete the years before that one's user ratings until ten years is up, if you catch my drift). If ""Twister"" 1996 came out now a days there would be 300k people voting in 3 days and giving it an 8.6 rating (still to high at 6.0, but the movie wasn't very old when IMDb started up).2) Review...I couldn't finish watching ""The Dark Knight"". I tried earlier this year and then again the other night. It was horrible..... Let's start with the actors shall we...Ken dolls trying to act; a ""cough-cough"" not very attractive leading lady; and, of course, the highly overrated, yet not all that terrible, performance from Heath Ledger. Let's face it, anyone who saw ""Batman"" 1989 could see the rip off with Ledger's Joker. Michael Caine as Alfred???? Could you take him seriously as Alfred after seeing him in Austin Powers. The Chinese bad guy was the best actor in the movie...Are you starting to understand how bad this is yet?!I just can't go into how poor the story elements are too much. I'll get a migraine. Example: The prosecutor punches the witness and then takes a gun off someone, pulls it apart and then leaves it in front of the defendant. No, I didn't oversimplify it. I didn't leave something out. It's really that stupid. The rest of the movie (at least as far as I got) is also that bad. I think that's all I need to say. There's just no point in going on. I'll just add the one positive aspect...The effects are top notch. 3) Summary...Money, hype, dead actor hype, special effects, blah blah blah. You know the drill. You only get one pair of eyes, so take care of them. Stay away!!!",0
"How could the critics and the public be so WRONG about a movie? Well, the public is easily influenced, especially if they are teenagers with no broad movie-going experience to allow them to contrast this with other films. But the critics? More and more I get the feeling that the reviews we see are no longer about quality but only about sales. In this world of ""reality"" shows that are anything but - and MTV music videos that are to what film-making is that McDonald's is to cuisine - well, who can blame them if they no longer have any reliable criteria?What is WRONG with this movie? Just about everything... First and foremost, we don't CARE about anyone. Whether they live or die doesn't seem to really matter at all. Did ANYONE get teary-eyed over Maggy Gyllenhaal's death? I certainly didn't. We are not really given any time to FEEL anything. Second: no real suspense about anything. We're not given enough information, there is almost no attempt to build suspense... we just sit there passively watching as events keep happening all around us with NO attention to logic. Just one example: the Riddler is left in a locked room with a policeman. He has bizarrely been left without his handcuffs on... and all of a sudden the two of tehm are outside the jail-cell, and the Riddler has a knife at the man's throat. We don't know where the knife came from, we didn't see him overpower the guard, we don't know how they got out of a locked room. This is LAZY film-making... and it happens over and over again throughout this film. Events happen but there is no logical progression. The action scenes. Terrible. Everything is shot like an MTV video. Close-ups of the action that leave us with very little idea of what is really happening. The car-chase sequences were boring, because we had no real idea of who was where. It was all just a lot of close-up chopped editing. If this is supposed to be thrilling, then I suggest everyone go back and watch the chariot race from Ben Hur. No special effects, no insane wild editing in close-ups that don't allow us to really see what is happening... and yet it is three (four, five?) times more exciting than anything in this film. Bruce Wayne/Batman: stupid voice for batman, is he trying to channel Darth Vador? Wooden acting ... no sense of humour. A bore. The Riddler: better than I expected, but not as brilliant as everyone says. OF COURSE he'll get the Oscar, but mainly because he should have gotten it for Brokeback Mountain, and because he died. Everyone else? Just wasted talent... Such a disappointment, after Batman Begins...",0
"For me, 'Batman Begins' is the ultimate Batman movie and I was very much looking forward to The Dark Knight. I had some reservations about Heath Ledger and thought that the hype about his playing is created only because of his untimely death earlier this year. But I was wrong as he was excellent as the Joker. As a matter of fact, he was so much better than anyone else in this movie that he sort of played the others 'off' the screen. The acting the other big names did in this movie seems very weak if I compare it to Ledger's outstanding work. This is his movie,no doubt about that. My real problem with this movie was that the plot is weak and a lot of things are predictable. While '..Begins' builds up the world of Batman and explains his motivations, clearly shows the links and connections and does all this in a stunningly dark & sinister atmosphere, The Dark Night fails to build on the heritage of Nolan's first Batman movie. Techincally this movie is 10/10 but as long as the story, characters and playing are concerned, it is just lame at several points. Bale's 'Batman voice' is just terrible and ridiculous at the same time. Instead of adding to the 'batmanism' of Bruce Wayne this voice-thing makes him funny, in a very lame way. I was more than annoyed by this while watching the movie. All in all, I so much wanted to love this movie but looks like this won't happen. My mark is 5/10.",0
"Being a Libertarian wherein one debates the proper time and place for Force, dismayed at the level of government interference in people's lives, but also willing to do what is necessary to survive through defensive forms of Force, this movie does provide fodder for thought. Also, as a believer to some degree in the theories of French Absurdism as an avenue to proto-nihilistic philosophies I can perhaps understand that real life does not some up to an easily digestible whole, but a movie that is primarily entertainment should take you to some endpoint intellectually.Does the prior paragraph make much sense? To initiates, it probably does, for people looking for some action and a bag of popcorn maybe not. And that's the problem for TDK for me. It purports to be one thing, executes something much different, and become unsatisfying as either. If I'm in the mood for a shoot'em up popcorn movie, I'd like a little complexity, sure, but I want the good guys to be good guys and bad guys dead. If I'm looking for a treatise on the absurdity of life and also how man wrapped up in fear, real or imagined, will resort to all sorts of Force that is misplaced and misused, I'll watch something else. I can even at least see a movie that leaves you hanging quite a bit as the use of Art to prove a point, not only as the message but the medium as well. But I certainly don't want an examination of existentialism bound up with my popcorn movie. It just ends being a waste of two and half hours.Basically TDK can't be both a pleasant diversion and a deep philosophical movie about the death penalty, righteous Force, blind fear of the masses, thugacracy, and even more. A movie that has fast action fight scenes, with breaking bones and baddies being dumped over railings to some unknown end, a movie that maintains its limited view of action and consequence (like these baddies being taken off to a hospital for care or some such instead of being simply gone) and yet be a piece to evoke philosophical debate. Basically it can't have its cake and eat it too.The movie basically creates a character of pure nihilism in the Joker and then doesn't know what to do with it. What point is trying to be made? It almost seems the creative team didn't know either, or nothing they'd admit to. So I don't mind being philosophically open ended, but such doesn't in any way make for a satisfying action movie. And yet it still pandered to the action movie template far too often to believe that it was a serious philosophical movie.Basically it was a mess that more or less wasted two and a half hours.",0
"This film was too hyped up...by the time it opened here in Hong Kong it had been praised to high heaven, including here on IMDb. (one reviewer said that it was close to being a masterpiece!) Heath Ledger's death played a huge part in that I suppose, and when compared to the dreadful ""Batman"" films of the recent past one might be tempted to be impressed.BUT in my opinion: this work offered an opening scene which really grabbed me only to go slowly downhill. There was lots of mainstream American-style action and some nice performing by Ledger, but I couldn't get over the corny acting of Aaron Eckhart (playing Harvey Dent), and the lame Christian Bale (Batman). I thought that they ruined the film. Dreadful.Maggie Gyllenhaal (playing Rachel Dawes) was so unattractive that it was actually hilarious when she was referred to as being lovely in the film. I really had trouble watching her in this role. Is her face melting or something? Whats with that huge pimple thing? Sorry, but really...she is not a pretty woman. Not even close.I was thrilled to see Cillian Murphy early in the film, only to realize that it was a cameo! Morgan Freeman? Michael Caine? Whats with that? Perhaps I see too many independent films to appreciate this kind of production.It seems as if loads of people are raving about The Dark Knight, and I respect their opinion...but I give it a 5.",0
"I saw The Dark Knight last night. And although the movie itself isn't too bad, its not as good as the batman fanboys would like you to believe. The film has still a lot of flaws and the playtime is just too long. I've seen people walk out 30 minutes before the movie ended just out of pure boredom.If they would have made the film at a faster rate it would have been a lot better.Then there's batman's voice... Its absolutely absurt. Nobody talks like that. Well maybe Ned from Jimbo & Ned (SouthPark). But really it makes the whole movie one big joke.The side-characters get far to little attention, I can't remember any of their names. Only positive thing about this movie is the Joker, who makes an interesting bad-guy.I would have rated this movie a 6, because its not awful. But im going to give it a 1, just because the current rate (9,2) is totally overrated.",0
"Totally weak, are there so many sponges out there that seriously believe this is a good film? Just stop one moment, look at the top 250 best films of all time list and ask yourself honestly is this better than any of these. This wouldn't even come in the top 2500 list. At best an average film, it is better than 1 out of 10, but hopefully sane people can redress the balance between people who might have seen more than 10 movies in their lifetime and those that have not. There are so many flaws in this movie they are innumerable. Batman begins was far superior and definitely Christopher Nolan's worst film to date. Very disappointed.",0
"I was could not wait to see this movie on the opening weekend. The critics and audiences everywhere were giving this movie such high praises. So I rushed to my local theater to catch what could be a known as the greatest superhero movie ever made in history. Two hours and something minutes later after the movie was done I realized the greatest thing ever made in history was the marketing package for The Dark Knight. Boy, did they over-hype this colossal nonsense of a movie.SPOILERS! 1) I don't understand why the martial arts style, Keysi, was used in the film. It just doesn't look cinematically pleasing in any sense. In the documentary for Batman Begins, the choreographers wanted Batman to look like an angry beast that would just run over people with his attacks. They didn't want to make the fighting look like a dance (like traditional Wushu). Great. So then what they decided to do was get a bunch of guys who look like they made a fighting style up. They look like monkeys hammer fisting each other! If you don't believe me check out the documentary: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVWyqBdE5RI). As a result the fighting was clumsy, poorly staged, and filmed. Batman is supposed to be stealthy, nimble, yet powerful. But instead, he moves heavily and lethargically.2) Choppy plot development: Right after Batman dives off the building to save Rachel, what happens to the Joker? We're made to assume he left because Dent was not there. But was that it? Joker crashes a party, finds nothing, and just leaves? It's a movie about The Batman vs. The Joker!!! It's their first interaction with each other _ isn't that suppose to be a grand event??!! Nope, instead Joker drops Rachel, Batman goes to save her, and Joker leaves the party. Its plot points like that that really weakens the movie. Another example is Batman's batpod chase throughout the city. At the very end of the sequence, Batman hurls himself at the Joker and falls off the bike. WTF???? No grand battle between good and evil? No epic moments of struggle between the two forces? Then James Gordon saves The Batman? Then why do we need Batman???? Which brings me to another point? 3) WHY EXPLAIN SO MUCH? I DON'T CARE WHERE BATMAN GOT ALL OF HIS TOYS!!! It's like every scene had to explain why Batman could do what he does. Batman can bend guns cause his gauntlets have steel clamps built in them, Batman has white eyes because it's part of the sonar technology, Batman can now move his head around because the suit is now segmented instead of being once piece, Luscious Fox helps Batman utilized an escape method that was used in the 1960's by the military and so on and so on and so on and so on?.If Batman is suppose to be this mythic creature, then why bother to demystify him at all? From the way they are explaining Batman, it just seems as if ANYBODY can be Batman. All you have to do is get martial arts training and a lot of money and that's it _ NOW YOU ARE THE BATMAN. I can understand the explanations being used in Batman Begins, because it was an origins story, but in the Dark Knight, let's see why he's so good. Why only Bruce Wayne can be The Batman.4) And why all the philosophizing? I can understand the serious themes of the Batman mythos. In the books like ""Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth"", """"The Long Halloween, Brian Azarello's ""Joker"" they take the time to explore the Dark Knight's world and the characters that inhabit them, but without trying to cram pompous banalities into your mind. In between the action scenes were benign philosophical interludes that were pretentious. And Batman talks way too much. Yes, Batman is more than just a muscle bound superhero, but couldn't we see that through his work as a Detective (which is what he is)? And the voice Christian Bale used was horrible to begin with so making him ramble on and on about right and wrong wasn't appealing at all.5) This movie was The Joker movie. It wasn't about the Batman. Nolan said he tried to make it more about the hero. He didn't want to make the ""mistake"" that Burton did with his Batman films where the hero was more of a minor character. Nolan repeated that mistake. Joker was once again the main focus of the movie.6) It was way too long. The movie should've ended after Batman defeated the Joker. Why bring Two Face into the picture at this point (where I was getting ready to leave the theater)? I really wished they saved Two Face for the third movie.So hopefully in the third movie they take a step back and really try to slow it down a bit. I know Nolan was ambitious in his creation of the sequel, but I felt like those ambitions blinded his ability to see the details. Too be honest?I probably should have just rented this instead of paying $15 for the IMAX showing.",0
"When I saw Nolan's ""Batman begins"" I thought it was poorly directed - Not because Nolan is a bad director, but because this style of directing does not fit a comic. You can't take a movie about a guy in a bat suit too seriously and dismiss all comic aspects. Tim Berton knew this, directed accordingly (although this is also his usual style) and the result was a good movie. Nolan ignored this fact. The result was a movie that was not realistic at all, and yet tried to seem serious - an unintentional parody. The ""eastern wisdom and training"" montage clichés didn't help either.With ""The Dark Knight"", Nolan keeps making the same mistake, only this time its much worse. If the film is supposed to be realistic, you can't have so many unrealistic assumptions. One example: How is it the the Joker can get anywhere and do anything he want? He plants powerful radio activated bombs everywhere (it takes a whole company just to design these), He infiltrates the world's most powerful crime organizations etc. He keeps talking about how people start behaving like animals once you start disrupting their ordered world. But a plan of the Joker's magnitude would in real life require a huge, organized and coordinated group. Actually, in order to create ""anarchy"" in real life, you would have to organize and create a new form of order, so the Joker's point is moot.And that is just one of many contradictions I feel this movie has. That's OK for a movie that doesn't seem to take itself too seriously (like Berton's), but not for this one that seemingly aspires to be 'realistic' and to be taken seriously.The reason to give 2 stars instead of one: Superb acting by Heath Ledger.",0
"This comment is labelled as containing spoilers. In fact, it describes no actual events from the film, but it does talk about underlying themes, and it refers to 3 lines of dialogue. Read on if you wish.Batman has a new enemy - the Joker - and a new potential ally, Harvey Dent, the new up-and-coming District Attorney. The film quickly develops into a study of good versus evil.We discover the Joker's motivation for the evil that he does ... he has no apparent ultimate aim, he simply enjoys being evil. The sheer senselessness of his acts makes him unpredictable. As the film unfolds, the forces of good appear powerless; whatever they do, there is a greater evil, a more twisted motivation that they are unintentionally feeding. The film's title is, in fact, a triple pun ... it is metaphorically a ""dark night"" for the city, and much of the significant action takes place in a single night. By the end, we are asked to consider whether good or evil are simply a matter of luck, and whether truth as well as law are an inconvenience to doing good.The film is therefore thoroughly postmodern. It could be described as doing for justice what ""Titanic"" did for love ... showing it to be worthy and desirable, but ultimately unsustainable in the face of evil, corruption, and random blows dealt by Fate. There are some events in which good is seen to triumph, but in hindsight these are plot contrivances ... to do evil would have been so much easier.The film itself is also senseless in some ways. The factors that made the Joker what he is are never laid out. Nor are the (sometimes incredible) feats of anticipation and cooperation, which allow the Joker often to have an extra card up his sleeve, ever explained.There are two subtexts beneath the central theme of overwhelming evil: one is intentional, the other (I think) not. The first one is Batman's credo: ""sometimes, to do good, you have to act outside the law"". The second is based on a line spoken by the Joker: where good and evil clash on equal terms, evil is more powerful, because the good have to follow rules, whereas the evil have no rules.The film is well made: the special effects are very impressive, the acting is generally good, and it's technically very well made. But I found it disturbing and (literally) hopeless.",0
"Simply the worst...I was hoping for some good movie...Hell! I fought it'll be great! My brother saw it first, and said it was good sh it. Than it was my 'turn'. I remember, when I was already going out from cinema, I've wished I could Punch (twice) Nolan in his face. Batman is my fave comic hero...but it's not important right now. What's important is that God Damn Nolan gave us piece of Max Commercial movie for little kids. It's not realistic, as Nolan said it would be. And it's not 'dark' either. I should've known that The Dark Knight will be the same sh it as Bat: Begins...But it doesn't help for my frustration. I wish Burton could make few more Bat Movies...His dark vision of Gotham was incredible. Art Deco with style and fashion of 50s, combine with present time...o.k. with late 80s...And Jack as THE JOKER...I think it was a role of his life...H. Ledger was good, but he didn't beat Jack The King... but he was really good....Shame, that Ledger was the only one who knew what he was doing...And in the end...Joker didn't save the day...and The Dark Guano is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 1 of 10 is more than it deserves. I'm not from The Great US of A...or England. So if my comment seems a little shi tty, give me a brake... Post Scriptum Bale was totally without balls in this movie. I like him but?but I'm telling what I've seen. But what totally destroyed the movie, were giant holes in plot and this incredible stupid device, that converts mobile phone in Allah, God, Buddha, Confucius knows what. PS2 I must tell this?do any of you believes that prisoners on one of those boats loaded with explosives, wouldn't have blown to high sky that other boat? And the same about those good citizens",0
"I must be the odd one out. I saw this movie with my son. Both of us found the movie very bad, bad story line very bad action. Only reasonable acting was Heath Ledger as the Joker.Yes there is action, lots of action. But the action is action for the action, it hard to see a story line.The story is also very over the top. I know it is a kind of SF movie but unlike Starwars the action and gadgets are totally exaggerated.I liked the other Batman movies better.So overall a wast of moneyIt was hard not to fall asleep. .. .. ..",0
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead).",0
"In Christopher Nolan's darker reboot of the Batman franchise, Christian Bale plays the masked hero. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine join the cast as regulars, with guest stars in each installment as villains or temporary females. I watched the previews for these films and never had any desire to watch them. To me, Michael Keaton is Batman, and no remake can ever compare. My brother practically forced me to watch The Dark Knight, after Heath Ledger won his posthumous Oscar, and even though he raved and raved, I remained unimpressed. To me, the Batman films aren't supposed to be that dark and disturbing. Batman originated in a comic book, and should therefore be accessible to children. Nolan's imagination of Gotham City does not keep in view of the original comic or previous adaptations. It has the same feel of the types of films that specialize in serial killers.My brother raved about Christian Bale's American accent. I'd heard him show his talent at accents in other films, so this gravelly-voiced performance didn't terribly impress me. The villains_Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow_were needlessly frightening and relied on gimmicks rather than acting. Heath Ledger's untimely death was extremely tragic, but his performance in this film didn't warrant a nomination, let alone an Oscar win. He had a lot of makeup on, spoke in a different accent, and flicked his tongue in and out so audiences would think he's insane. The tongue flick is as old a trick in the book as it is to chew gum when playing a bimbo.There are extended action sequences that showcase vast special effects, so if you only watch movies based on how impressive the special effects are, you will probably want to rent this one. And, to be honest, younger audiences will probably really enjoy the reboot of the series. They didn't grow up watching it as originally intended, and today's audiences have short attention spans that need to be sensationalized every few minutes. Older folks who liked the Michael Keaton movies should stay far away from these.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary and upsetting images, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",0
"I fail to see how people are actually taking this movie seriously.Batman is meant to be an enjoyable superhero/comic book blockbuster, but that is all. The film makers feeble attempt to make things more 'serious' by throwing in the cringing ferry and solar phone tap scene were embarrassingly unnecessary and came off as patronising to the audience.Furthermore, the use of real NY style sky scrapers for Gotham City (in some far from subtle way of making more 9/11 America comparisons) ruined the distorted and macabre atmosphere of Gotham city that Tim Burton had translated so well onto screen. The fictional comic book edge was further lost by showing us the Joker's violent followers from behind to expose their masks. While all this might have made the movie fresher and more realistic- why keep the entirely unbelievable and cackling Joker character? Instead, Heath Ledger's excellent performance feels out of place with the rest of the movie.And while Heath did play the joker very well, it is not exactly difficult to play a cartoon, fictional and face painted psycho. If you want to see a real Oscar winning performance of a psychopath, watch Monster (2006). If he gets the Oscar sympathy vote for this I would have no more respect for the Academy and it's flawed voting process.",0
"It just got so boring. Lots of silly chases and explosions and people doing dare-devil stunts. Whoop-dee-do! But what about the plot? What about a bit of realism in the way people would react to the stuff shown in this film. And what about trying to stick to the laws of physics when doing these ridiculous stunts.But mostly, I couldn't really care what happened to any of the characters in this film. I couldn't care less if Batman or the Joker got blown up or shot. And it just went on and on and on... Good grief, they could have cut an hour off and it might have been a good film.I kept looking at the time and thinking ""How long to go before I can get out of here?"".I see someone on the message boards has a topic ""I haven't met anyone who hasn't liked this film"". Well, now you have.",0
"Glad to see I'm not the only one who didn't like The Dark Knight. I can step back and objectively say it was a ""good"" movie on some levels, the performances, over-the-top entertainment, etc. But the bottom line is I hated it. Loud, obnoxious, pointless, and soulless. Who are these awful people? Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker, and it was impressive. He's fascinating to watch. But what is the point of his character? At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role, Heath's joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value. I don't get the point. Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining, are we that desperate?I was disappointed in Christian Bale too. He is one of the best actors working today, but this time he was kind of flat. I thought he was better in Batman Begins. This entire movie is just so over-the-top: explosions (wow an explosion, that's new), the cool looking but ridiculous motor-cycle, the millionth chase scene, repulsive characters like Two-Face, and on and on. We've seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers, and this loud, obnoxious trash is the result. We really are getting desperate.I usually agree with IMDb more or less, the ratings are usually reliable. But right now this is #5, come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie? I'm not hating it on purpose because of the hype, I liked Iron Man and that got hyped, I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped. But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash.",0
"I don't understand the big deal over the Dark Knight. Sure its OK and the actors are OK and all but its not GREAT. I believe that the movie wasn't all that great and was way to boring. My opinion is the movie is O.K. The atmosphere was the main theme of the movie, it was meant to shock us, gore us out and make us feel sympathy. It dragged on to long and by the end i was half asleep and was glad it was over. As soon as it started I was excited to be watching and by the end i was waiting for it to finish. Most of the actors irritated me. I laughed when the love interest died. She annoyed me.But the movie wasn't horrible. Im not saying its the worst movie I've ever seen - but its not one of the greatest. It definitely has no right to be up there with the greatest. No moment in this movie made me stop and think - wow this is good. If you like action you may like this movie but if you like non-stop excitement you won't.Sure there will be people out there who think that this movie is a masterpiece and there will be people out there that don't like it like myself. But I don't believe such a movie has the right to be called one of the greatest movies of the year, or of all time.",0
"Overall disappointed probably due to all the over-hype surrounding it. I had heard statements like best 'Superhero movie ever' which is way off the mark, its not even the best this year (See Hellboy 2 much better). I'm probably making it sound bad which it is not, its a good film but I thought 'Batman Begins' was much more original and interesting, this is much more like all the other movies in the genre with nothing particularly unique going on.As to Heath Ledger's performance as 'the Joker' again well over rated, Its certainly a good solid and convincing performance but its not an Oscar winning performance. That said its the highlight of the film and much better than Bale's Batman who sounds like a telephone Pervert.",0
"From the desk of Warner Brothers Marketing department:Please note that the release of the new Batman movie we just completed already has plenty of fanfare behind it. Sadly, one of the actors can no longer partake in the new photo shoots and ads. Our job will be to catapult it above any other movie, and we have a plan for this, but first, let's discuss some things about the movie. I know not all of you have seen the movie in it's completion because, frankly, it's a mess. The editing department couldn't make heads or tails out of half the scenes before we had to involve the director to see what in the world was going on in his mind. So here it is in a nutshell:We all think it turned out to be an good action movie. It's story was fairly well constructed, with more going then just a simple superhero against the bad guy movie. Being better than 'Begins', you didn't have to go through the origins of Bruce Wayne, & instead focus on the meat of the story. And we like Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey. It all sounds great, but that's where the great ends.See, the movie just had to cluster another bad guy, Two-Face, into the movie an hour and 45 into it. It made for a tremendously long movie. In a movie like, say X-men, it's good to be long, since each character can share some interesting interaction for screen time. A movie like Batman should never clock more then 2 hours, yet at 152 minutes, Dark Knight over-stretches it's welcome. Scenes that just went on and on with conversations. Even during the movie, we knew editing could have been better, and some speeches between the characters were either redundant or overdone.The story even dwindles with the Joker, teasing us with past issues that could have been real but perhaps aren't. When Alfred said ""some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."", he described Joker pretty well, and it was one of the best quotes in the movie. But the purpose of a good movie that has good vs. evil is that the bad guy has more depth then the good guy, in some cases, we fall in love with the bad guy and can almost seem to go along with him, if not his actions, then the ends to his means. Or perhaps the fallacies that we see in all of us, as scary as it seems to see that deep into ourselves how the 'evil' in some movies reflect that mean spirit in some of us represented with a social comment, like media or government. You can even compare a movie like V for Vendetta and you can begin to see what we mean.Batman may be the ultimate representation of a good guy with an 'attitude' that goes after criminals that seemingly have no agenda but to be out of their minds. He was grown and started as a creature during the depression, as a shining light against the evil corporations and government. We see it in the comic books. Dark Knight, however, will be a raging success, not because it makes a social commentary or deep character study, but because the general public eats up popular figures with action scenes that doesn't have to make us think, only try to fill in our desires of revenge with interesting technological gadgets.Here are some better movies: Better action: Matrix, Wanted, cheesy 80's sci fi movies, like Terminator Better story lines: Sin City, V for Vendetta, Seven Samurai Better Superheros with Attitudes: Wolverine, Hellboy, Conan, Lobo And of course, Better bad guys: Hannibal Lecter, Darth Vader, Anton Chigurh (from No Country For Old Men), hell we even like Kaiser Soze- Any of the above bad guys can have an entire book based on them. I can write a description of the Joker in one small paragraph.Another problem may be that Warner Brothers has put all their eggs into Batman, Superman notwithstanding. Marvel comics now owns the rights to superheroes on the screen, together with Iron Man, Hulk, & the upcoming Thor and Captain America. They have a vision for the big picture for the future of ""The Avengers"" in 2011 (?) That's a crap-load of heroes but if they play the cards easy, & it shouldn't be too hard, they will have a winning formula for future projects involving even more comic book heroes. But whereas Marvel was busy creating a production company to make business with many of the characters in the Marvel Universe, we.. well..Anyway, what we need you all to do... every single one of you, from the cameramen to the gaffer, is to sign up on places like IMDb and other movie sites, and give Batman a 10. Write up a review that shows none of the above, make sure you plug for emotional effect with the passing of our fine fellow actor, & make it seem like he deserves an Oscar.-WBMDPS: After the write ups and ratings boosts are done, come back to the premiere party next week for biscuits and coke!",0
"I have never watched a Batman film before, in fact I have never watched a super hero film before. I'd picked up that this was the best of them, so when I saw that it is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video I thought I'd have a look. Well I have discovered that super hero films are certainly not for me.As a child I really loved the Batman DC comics and in that animated world for children it works very well. However the realisation of the comic character in a more adult context is just totally silly. That voice he has sounds like Dirty Harry only more so and it is just funny.The Joker seems to be able to construct remarkable situations at a moment's notice. It is not credible. At every turn there seems to be something that has no credibility with the viewer and so you just don't care about what is happening.There is no adventure in this film nor are there any particularly clever twists or turns in the plot, primarily there seem to be some situations that the Joker sets up. Batman's solutions seem to be boring brute force either with fists or technology. In fact I think the DC comic Batman was a cleverer and more interesting guy.It was quite nice seeing Michael Caine but I don't think his, or anyone else's script was very imaginative.Boring and silly throughout.",0
"In my 43 years on this planet, I have never seen a more manic depressive movie than The Dark Knight. This movie alternates between insufferable, back-aching boredom to frenetic, hold-on-to-your-seat action. And most of the action sequences are amazing. It's probably worth the price of admission just to see the action sequences and Ledger's performance.It does not surprise me that this movie had FIVE WRITERS. I knew this half way through the movie before I even looked it up. How did I know this sitting in the movie? Four things will tip you off to multiple writers in a movie. (1) Haphazard, rambling direction. (2) Storyline on top of storyline on top of storyline. (3) The movie ends FIVE TIMES (one for each writer). (4) More than two hour running time (this movie is almost three hours -- remember the mess that was Spiderman 3??).From the very beginning, this movie seems to have no direction whatsoever. You could literally take the script to this movie and divide each scene up on separate sheets of paper, throw them up in the air, gather them up and shoot this movie again and nothing would change. That's how disorganized and haphazard the story proceeds. There are at least five side-stories, all of which are hard to follow and difficult to understand how they fit in to the overall story (blowing up two ferries?).BY FAR the most annoying part of The Dark Knight is Christian Bale's unbelievably over-the-top, angst-ridden portrayal of Batman. As Bruce Wayne, he delivers a great performance. When he straps on the gear, he becomes this growling, hilariously overwrought caricature of the Batman we know and love. He had people in my theater LAUGHING when he talked. It's a ridiculous performance and it's the director's fault.And, who is the annoying basset hound playing Rachel? Horrible actress. Not even remotely hot. I never thought I'd miss Katie Holmes.I'd rather see Iron Man fifty times before seeing this again.But don't let that keep you from seeing the movie. Ledger alone is worth the price of admission.",0
"I loved Batman Begins. It advanced from Burton's shallow fun and brought him reality. Naturally I expected yet more from Goyer and Nolan. Boy was I wrong. This ""movie"" is a nerdy fanboy jerk fest. The hype it has received is so unjustifiable that it can only be the product of Warner marketing and fanboy Internet manipulation; no film can go to #1 on IMDb in 48 HOURS without prior orchestration.While a final reckoning between Batman and Gotham's lowest is inspired the story becomes a mess of plot lunacy. The Joker's great but I was dumbstruck to watch the camera suck off Ledger's performance to wallpaper over plot chasms, generally shallow characters and a complete lack of the Dark Knight himself. Where is Batman in this movie!? He is nothing, a playboy billionaire on a yacht who wrecks Lamborghini's in a vain attempt to prove he's a hero. He didn't prove it to me one shred. Batman Begins reveals Wayne as a tortured soul making the world a better place for the memory of his mother and father. His moral code here was impossible to track. He mocks other vigilantes with high school quips about hockey while they get murdered (along with many) for what they believe. Isn't what they believe what he believes? Claims he mustn't kill (comic lore) as its immoral but happily jams shut a police interrogation door so he can beat six bells out of the Joker. It seemed to me that Gordon and Dent with the placid Ms. Dawes were in the moral front line while Batman lurks in shadows. All Mr. Wayne contributes are ridiculous gizmo's for epileptic action scenes. Batbike's tripping trucks like Skywalker tripping an ATAT, cell phones become security cameras, Gatling guns that rebuild bullets so we can scrutinise fingerprints for no good reason, another bat-suit, Lamborghini's & yacht lounging, need I go on?The worse effect of this is do you even need Batman? Consider a film with Gordon and Dent fighting alone against the Joker's criminal nihilism. They battle and win only for Dent to be consumed by his war against evil. Sounds good? I was watching that fine movie until they wrote Batman into it! And when the Batman spoke at all it was digitised alligator gruff tone that made me laugh. The story ricochets everywhere. Hong Kong, a Gotham come Miami and through multiple plots until you're just enjoying the cinematography during another action yawn. After two hours I could not care who did what or why, least of all Batman. This film resembled an over hyped episode of ""24"", complete with real-time ""waronterror"" inspirations, to such a degree I wondered if Jack Bauer would make a better Batman. At least he would have been at the forefront of events a little more. For a superhero the Dark Knight was an amoral superflop. The culmination of this movie's propensity for absurdity it the arrival of Two Face. His injury from some of the Joker's mountain of bombs is ridiculous. No human being could come close to surviving this let alone check out of a hospital to roam the streets for revenge. But it was done for the comic owner's need to make the silly real for fans and ultimately that's what this film is about.Dark Knight's biggest error is its script editing. It seems most of the writing is done by the Nolan brothers with just minor input from Goyer. Has the studio let the Nolan boys run amuck? Every idea they have come up with (or stole from ""24"") is crammed into this film until it explodes. Some don't rate Goyer but he has more experience writing and may have controlled (a few must be his) the absurd elements and kept pacing sensible. This film is also far detached from Nolan's previous work (Prestige, Momento) and is either a poorly conceived sortie into action adventure on his part or the studio's yanked the rug from under him. It does appear Warner's sponging off Ledger's unfortunate demise with him receiving TRIPLE screen time from Batman. Bale also seems bored when he performs. He has always liked deep complex characters to play so I suspect he was also unimpressed with the script.Batman Begins was outstanding but IMHO The Dark Knight lets its predecessor down in spectacular fashion. I won't say don't see it. Do and make up your own mind. If you are one of the happy, brain washed masses that love The Dark Knight because Warner/DC says you should then enjoy. However, I am not one of them. Sorry Bat fans.",0
"As a fan of Batman, this is undoubtedly the most unpopular opinion of my entire life. But I cannot stand this movie. For me this is the most pretentious and overrated movie in the history of cinema. Heath Ledger's Joker was charismatic, but taking it away ... What do we have? We have a movie that makes Batman a mere supporting character in his own film. A Batman with no balls and no detective soul. Confused, messy, uninspired fights. Boring, lifeless, uninspired scenarios. A Gotham turned into some another generic and commom American city. An overly dramatic, heavy, humorless and violent tone. Batman is usually dark, yes, but one thing is to be dark, another is to want to sound like a play by Shakespeare. TDK takes itself very seriously and this sucks. Oh for God's sake, at the end we are talking just about a guy who dresses in bat and walks around town for fighting crime. It doesn't have to be complicated, it doesn't have to be too complex, it doesn't have to be very philosophical. I just want to look at the movie and think, ""This is a Super-Hero movie!"" Exactly the same feeling that Spiderman 1, 2 and Burton movies always makes me feel every time I watch. The Dark Knight is not a genuine Super-Hero movie. It's simply a police story that happens in a generic city by chance called Gotham where by chance Batman and the Joker are inserted, with Batman being only a supporting character.",0
"After first 30 minutes I was about to get out of the theater but I gave it a chance, I left after 60 minutes.. Great cast, most boring plot, I know that probably it has great CG overload effects at the end and all the good guys win. I don't understand the actual rating for the movie, I expect it to fall drastically in the next few days. I suspect manipulation in here and it is a sad thing to see when the business takes over and the honest rating for the movie does not matter anymore.Great, I want 60 minutes of my life back and the money for my ticket.Don't spend money on that dirt.avrook",0
"I went to see ""Dark Knight"" because of Heath Ledger, only. ""Batman Begins"" SUCKED, Chris Nolan SUCKS. ""Batman Begins"" made no sense at all(For people with brains, that is). (Spoiler) First; Chris Nolan's direction was nauseating, there were too many camera movements during some action scenes, where they could have been better without. Second; Nolan under-used the best villain in the movie(Scarecrow) and mis-casted the other one(Ra's al Ghul-Watanabe should have remained and Liam Neeson should have been out). Third; During Bruce Wayne's training on top of the mountain, he was asked to execute a ""Perp"", he refused, than started a brawl with the clan, burned down the monastery, killed most of the clan, including the ""Perp"" that he refused to kill in the first place, and saved the life of the one person that he should have let die(No common sense at all). (Spoiler) I had hoped that ""Dark Knight"" would be better, with less camera movements(Didn't happen). There were cameras rotating in circles around people just standing still(Very annoying and un-professional, it's bad for people with REM(That's ""Rapid Eye Movements"" and ear infections). Nolan did used his villains well in the ""Dark Knight"". The Non-Traditional Joker was maniacal in a good way, Two-Face was well used, he did a great job, even Rachel Dawes was wonderful. (Spoiler) The bad part about this movie was the Batman himself. If all these people who commented on this movie, actually saw the same movie that I saw, they should also note that Batman did absolutely nothing in this movie, there was nothing ""Dark"" and nothing ""Knight"" about Batman. All he did was abused and brutalized the Joker, inside a police interrogating room, no less(Amazing), when the Joker was already dazed and drained. There was a couple of minutes of fist-fighting with the Joker on top of a balcony, but nothing confrontational, or face Two-Face(Ha-I made a funny).(Spoiler) There was a ridiculous scene, where a couple of citizens dressed as Batman, doing their own vigilante things, using automatic weapons, and costumes that looked like Batman's(How/where did they get those copied costumes?), fighting a hooded Scarecrow, I think(Nolan left us with no details). If it was the real Scarecrow, I'm sure he would have used his ""Fear Agents"".(Spoiler) The writing was bad for Bruce Wayne as well, he had a few tacky lines, that made him look more stupid and repulsive, instead of pretend-clumsiness from Tim Burton's Batman. If you have a brain inside your skull, save your money for the DVD, at least you will get more extras for your money. Ignore those ""Fanatic"" nerds, who believes that ""Dark Knight"" is a great movie. Watch it for Heath Ledger only, on DVD.",0
"All i think i need to say is this was a good film but needs to be out of the top 100 movies of all time.. ITS NOT THAT GOOD!! Its just a Batman film and thats all it will ever be, OK it may be the best batman film made but thats not hard to do was it. People need to really think before they vote and not give it ten out of ten just because the joker is now dead.i would have really given it an 7/10 but gave it a 1/10 because it needs to get out of the top 100.but all in all its worth a look.7/10 VOTE THE FILM NOT THE ACTOR!",0
"I've never seen Batman Begins....but my friends told me I'd get The Dark Knight anyway....they were way wrong. This movie has either no plot at all... or a plot so complex that the average person won't get it at all. What's up with the mob thing, it was never explained it any way shape or form, and the movie was thrown into chaos so quickly that I sat through the whole 2 and a half hours of it trying to figure out what the heck was going on. My friends told me that the first one was so much better, but I don't know if I even want to see it after this pathetic attempt at a movie. If your looking for something to see, skip The Dark Knight...and see Mamma Mia. Now that's a movie everyone would absolutely love.",0
"Good cinematography and special effects makes a perfect movie??? Well, according to most people, I guess so. But for people like me (unfortunately there aren't too many of us individual-minded thinkers left), it takes a good STORY to lure us in. To me, this movie tried noticeably hard to pack everything together and failed... of course unless good cinematography and special effects gives you a hard on. A way-overdone story with an unrealistic genius villain loaded with shattering glass and more shattering glass is what I got out of it. One thing after another made me feel like I was watching ""Batman: The Law & Order Miniseries."" Oh yeah, for one of the best, if not the best movie of all time, this thing didn't leave me in awe for a second or raise the hair on my arm one bit like so many movies with a believable, likable story. Funny to think how well this film would have done if you could take away let's see... the cinematography and special effects.",0
"This is some serious trash overrated junk in name of movies and comic book movies are not cinema this is a proof of it,there are tons of movies out there that deserves to be rated higher than this nonsense,and heath ledger other movies are way better then this this is horrible joker sucked so is batman this was supposed to be a batman movie but became about the bad guy joker he is not even a proper villain just so called tough guy it would take one hitman with sniper rifle to end this fool,batman also is a looser because he not kills bad guys and let innocents die,this is just bad writing as most of comic books are filled with ficitonal junk crap and they tried to makes this realistic and it works for a cash grab but not as a batman movie,,or a movie in general,this is horrible so is the new joker 2019 movie.",0
"For all those who think, that it is The Masterpiece - it's not, not even close, here's why: 1) The only strong role was Joker. Acting of others was above average. But Ledger, in my opinion, deserves a huge credit for making his character so impressive and realistic. 2) Second half of the movie got boring, because of the action scenes that were made only for the sake of action. At some point I started to ask myself a question ""Why"". I didn't find an answer in the movie. 3) Story is quite acceptable, but those that claim Dark Knight to be an art are floating somewhere near the epicenter of Americas self-indulgent ""culture"", where grown people are still more interested in comics than real art.It's a shame to see this movie near the top of IMDb 250. Even though I would like to write 3 or 4 for it, I decided to give those extra minus points in the name of some disoriented cinema spectator, who thought it to be perfect. Just beside Shindler's list and Pulp Fiction? Are you serious?To sum it up - I would advise all those that praise Dark Knight, have a few hours lecture about history of cinema. They might be surprised, what genial directors are capable of. I would suggest starting with Kubric, Tarkovsky, Copolla, Lynch... And after the lecture adjust their evaluation scale accordingly.",0
"The last time I had to ask so many questions during a film was during incomprehensible existential timewaster ""Tron"" (so now you also know roughly how old I am!). Significant exceptions aside, this is the ""Tron"" of the modern-day blockbuster world. I emerged saying ""yeah, well?"".I loved ""Batman Begins""; Christian Bale is my favourite Batman; and with this many great actors, it should have been a steal. Michael Caine in particular brings, with his briefest appearance on screen, a wonderful sense of comfort and pathos. But despite all this _ despite a general tone suitable to a post-traumatic, mid-recession era _ I was left entirely agreeing with a reviewer who described feeling unaccountably ""disconnected"" from the culture that spawned this film. The breathless adulation that some have heaped on the film has astonished me.I love dark things: I love film noir; and films of all sorts whose characters who struggle with their souls' messy urgings. But ""The Dark Knight"" is all dark looks and no urgings. Lots of reviewers have praised the 'dark Gotham' design: huh? It's modern-day New York in low light and with extra night thrown in! How is that brilliant? And the crime wave? You want a truly dark tone, watch ""Serpico"" or ""Blue Collar"". To make a really good action film about corruption, everyone _ literally everyone _ needs to be, or to seem, corrupt. How much more interesting would this film have been if Rachel, Alfred and Lucius Fox were under suspicion, or better still, actually corrupt and working against Batman? Or if Batman were found in his Penthouse by Rachel, curled up naked and whispering mad nothings like a Gotham Howard Hughes? Bale was half asleep, or may as well have been _ what a waste of that intense face, his physicality! Ledger was very, very impressive, and this was his film _ he would eventually have made the lists of the really great actors if he could have kept from doing rubbish films like ""Casanova"". The charismatic Maggie Gyllenhaal is a pleasant change but even she can't perform the magic trick of making a meaningful character from an underwritten part. I've seen the Batman back catalogue, but throughout this I kept asking: ""so?she knows that Bruce is Batman?"" ""?so?she loves him but she's marrying someone else?"" ""?so?.she's known him all his life? Who IS she?"" I had no idea that this was the same girl Batman had brushed with in ""?Begins"", so for me, there was no history, no connection, no tension. Everything got absorbed in the central, overstretched idea of Batman's inner darkness versus the Joker's chaos theory.Like the vision of purgatory that is Batman's temporary lair while Wayne Manor is being rebuilt, mostly I think this film is about nothing more or less than the state of being bored. Batman is bored of his dual lifestyles. The Joker is bored of playing all by himself, the only intelligent psychopath in Gotham. Harvey is bored of winning his not very interesting games of chance. Glass-and-steel Gotham is 1980s dull; crime, which is money, is boring _ so boring that the Joker sets his money on fire. That party Bruce throws for Harvey _ come on! _ the most boring party on earth; Rachel's ""love"" triangle is the most boring love triangle ever. Maybe a different style altogether would have helped bring this spin on the story alive, such as comic animation in tune with the TV series, or hyper-stylised like ""Sin City"", which seems apt.It's absurd to imagine that this film _ mere dark-toned spun sugar confection that it is _ merits a place in any generation's top 100 list. Here's a revolutionary idea: how about NO more Batman, in this guise at least? Leave the superheroics in the capable hands of Iron Man and Hellboy and move on.",0
"This review is influenced by hunger. I didn't make the time to properly eat before watching this film. That meant sitting for 152 minutes feeling hungry. Warning: this review contains food metaphors.A great director is like a great chef. Great chef's understand how to balance a menu and keep your tastebuds dancing through your meal. Great director's understand how to balance a great film, they know how to keep an audience hanging on every scene, line and twist on the screen. The senses work in harmony with anticipation. It's all about knowing what to add in and what to leave out. It's also all about mixing your ingredients, making all the elements work together to create an experience for your customer. A sandwich and a glass of juice can be just as enjoyable as a 7 course tasting menu, a straightforward revenge film can be just as exciting as a blockbuster trilogy. It all comes down to the balance of ingredients and the way they are put together. As with any film or meal I watch or eat I try not to decide before experiencing it. The proof is always in the pudding. First impressions count. The opening scene was promising, this was a neat little appetiser. As bank job scenes go, this was one of the better efforts. My first thought was that to make a villain more dangerous, show them in stark daylight ? not dark shadows. It was a pleasant surprise to see The Joker in bright light. For some reason Batman has to be 'dark' - I appreciate that the original comics were 'dark', but I can't help thinking that a really brave director would play with that. Whenever the Joker was placed in harsh daylight that made him much more haunting than scuttling around in shadows.It was impossible not to watch the film without analysing Ledger's performance in a deeper way. His death was a tragedy and quite obviously added a macabre twist of reality to the film which the studio chose to run with. Some may feel uncomfortable with that, I don't. I'm sure if he were alive Ledger would want it that way and I am also sure he would welcome honest opinions of his performance. There has been talk that he should be nominated for an Oscar, to me rather than respecting him in death it actually belittles him. After the film I asked myself whether his performance merited an Oscar nomination; to me it didn't. It was obviously a great role to play and he played it excellently, but if that proves to be Oscar worthy, then I will find it hard to respect the Oscars as a standard of film excellence. What am I comparing against? Last years screen villain Javier Bardem. He set the bar for deranged psychopath. I asked myself; who would I not want to be in trouble with? Anton Chigurh every time. After Ledger it was a case of 'the rest of the film'. To me it was a let-down. The constant loud music and sound effects drowned out the mumbling of the actors. It was hard to follow what was going on and that may be the reason why I left wondering what the actual story was. There seemed to be too much going on, as if sticking to one clear plot line was a risk. As with the last film Michael Caine stole the best lines, Morgan Freeman also had his moments. Sadly Christian Bale seemed to sleepwalk through the film. I may be the only person in the known universe who thinks he was more wooden than a Welsh dresser. This was a big shame for me as I believe he's got what it takes to be a screen legend. Maybe it was the way he was directed, or the script?There were some clear absurdities running through the film. I can suspend disbelief enough to live with a caped billionaire flying around buildings and I can even let them get away with not putting a bullet into the Joker after about 15 minutes of the film. What I can't get is how Rachel Dawes was supposed to be 'really beautiful'. I'm sure Maggie Gyllenhaal is a lovely lady, but just as I'm not really handsome, she's not really beautiful. This had me confused. On top of all the other confusions that was where I lost the plot.If this film was dinner it would be a huge one course bowl with the tasty appetiser buried at the bottom. There would be nothing but rich fatty meats, chili's and heavy fish and egg sauces piled as high as possible and then covered with more sauces. Some beer would also be hoyed in and maybe some more sauce. There would be no rice, no veg and definitely no Brussels sprouts (not such a bad thing?) It was as though nothing was allowed to breathe, there was just a relentless assault of set pieces and noise all resulting in a tasteless mess. Obviously a dish like that is going to be popular with some, I totally understand that, but I'm looking for something else.With the ingredients available I was disappointed with this film. With a more direct plot and story, breathing space and pacing (was there any?) this could have been so much better. Nolan obviously has talent, but I was left feeling as though he is much smarter than the film he has just released. Was he under pressure to tick studio boxes, has he lost sight of the trees? If he gets another crack at this franchise I hope that he strips away the extraneous mess and delivers a more direct, better balanced Batman which is worthy of a top 3 IMDb ranking.",0
"One has to sit through a lot of idiocy in this sado masochistic wet dream in order to glean some exciting moments as this loud bombastic endless piece of highly polished garbage bashes it's way to a sequel. Given the running time there are plenty of thrills and chills that more or less simply repeat themselves for the last hour by which time it becomes a race between losing interest or your hearing.Gotham City is in danger of being picked clean by the mob. Only crusading DA Harvey Dent and Inspector Gordon stand between them. Enter the Joker, a sadistic yukster who can't get or deliver enough mayhem to all concerned. Even Batman has his hands full with the cruel overly optimistic and principled (it ain't about the money) bad Bozo. Now the stage is set to destruct much of the city, kill and injure much of the populace and give the Joker every opportunity to escape.Batman has always walked a fine line between fantasy and gritty realism (sci fi meets noir) that I felt succeeded when the tone was light. But this follow-up to Batman Begins allows even more darkness to seep in. The caped crusader is even more conflicted this time around since he's still sweet on his ex, now the DA's girlfriend. Then there is the impervious Joker. Still the energizer bunny to punishment he bounces back like a Joe Palooka doll no matter how bad the beating. After all if you kill him, you maim the sequel. The mirthful maniac, so crucial to keeping the train running is simply replaced by another less resilient villain.As Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale displays an ambiguous menace. As Batman he exchanges boiler plate philosophies (sprinkled with Bush administration policy) with cops and crooks sounding as if he has severe emphysema. It's hard to say if it's Heath Ledger or the make-up that makes him so ominous. Certainly the most sadistic Joker to date he lack's Nicholson's breezy take and better cosmetics as well as TV Joker Caesar Romero's boundless comic energy. But even with an Uncle Fester intonation he is a disturbing and convincing example of the fearless nihilist.Director Chris Nolan pours the chaos and carnage on like syrup with sensorial disregard. There's a well edited bank heist at the beginning of the film and Batman gets to tool around Gotham in a really cool motorcycle (Bat cycle?) but the biggest budget on earth (this may well have been) cannot disguise the fact it it is an inferior work to his gripping and imaginative Memento. Like another Indy phenom Steven Soderbergh he has chosen to sell out (Who can blame him, who wouldn't want a piece of the film gross?) to make bloated shiny movies that make a lot of noise and cash. The Hollywood moguls gain is the art house loss with this one time original filmmaker.The evolvement of Batman from the unique comic book crime fighter to the satirically brilliant TV show to the mega monster super film franchise has gone through many transformations to date. From the record breaking box office returns most would agree that it's for the better. Call me sentimental but it will never improve over the comic I would read twice while sitting under the maple tree in my yard and then trade even up with my friends for a Flash or a Green Lantern. Loud as this slick and crass masterpiece of marketing is it will never deliver the bang for the buck that the pages of the comic fed my imagination without all the noise.",0
"Unfortunately, this is a movie that just didn't know where to go most of the time. We have an almost three hour movie that really feels longer and doesn't know where to go and when to stop.First of all, let's talk about Heath Ledger's performance. The hype is absolutely justified. He lights up the screen with his performance and the film is delightful when he is on the screen. Part of the problem is that no other characters are equally as interesting and that includes Christian Bale as Batman. There is not all that much charisma in Christian Bale's characterization as Bruce Wayne and none of the other characters grab the screen the way Heath Ledger does, so the movie doesn't really give Heath Ledger much to play off of most of the time. Eric Roberts, almost unrecognizable probably due to the work that has been done on his face, has some acting moments in a minor role that cause a stir. I always liked him and wish I saw more of him.Meanwhile, the film has so many twists and turns that do nothing more than confuse, I felt more like I was in a maze that I couldn't get out of rather than on a roller coaster ride. Just when I thought there might be a resolution to the film, yet another plot twist, a new discovery would occur. I found myself looking at my watch after about an hour and a half or so, and the movie was only half over! The first part of the film, that is to say, the first hour, was more character setup and that was far more interesting. The first part of the film relied more on dialogue and there was quite a bit of evident wit. But when the plot points started getting laid on thick and heavy, I got restless and continued to get more so. At film's end, I ended up thinking ""So what?"". I was glad to have seen Heath Ledger's performance, but not much more than that. I felt, other than for Ledger, the film wasted my time (and money).",0
"I've tried to watch this twice now and each time I get distracted and put off by the ridiculous voice of batman. Most of the time I can't hear what he is saying. The film is disjointed at the beginning and occasionally the plot is hard to follow. Nothing seemed to flow. I did watch it to the end but I honestly can't tell you what happened. it was a bit forgettable. Heath Ledger as the Joker was brilliant. I can't believe that this is rated as one of the best films of all time. I watched this on DVD and I am glad I did because if I had been at the pictures I would have been even more disappointed. As far as the stunts, big scenes, action and thrills go, this film was excellent. The quality of imagination for some of the action scenes blew me away, but that still didn't distract from his voice. If we had a different voice, (and possibly a different actor) maybe this film would deserve to be up there with the best.",0
One of Nolan's worst films..... Bales voice is hilarious. Ultra cheese-fest it's like a bad network television show lmao.,0
"This is one of the worst movies ever made. If you think that it will be as good a the original I urge you to never watch this. Heaths over the top ridiculous performance as the joker was not Oscar worthy, but they gave it to him because he died and robbed him in Brokeback Mountain. The use of the Harvey character was pathetic and Christian Bale is one of the wost actors to ever play Batman. His Bruce Wayne is the only redeeming quality of the movie, other than Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordan. The whole movie is trying to be more epic than it is and this leads to a terrible storyline and pathetic use of special effects. I would recommend watching the original batman with Michael Keaton any day. Don't waste your time with this crap written by Nolan, he is a hack. Unless you like Batman sounding like he is Satan... don't watch this film",0
"OK, Batman TDK is a good thriller, worthing maybe a 7 out of 10: but is simply not conceivable that it is ranked more than masterpieces like The Godfather and other wonderful pieces of art. Batman TDK is NOT a piece of art: is just entertainment. Good entertainment, even if the movie is a bit long, the plot confused and sometimes non-sense (what about the logic of the ending? Mobile-phone image scanning?),etc. etc. as other reviewers already commented. The Batman character voice is also pathetic with the forced laryngitis-like tone: do you want Batman to talk like a 140 kg wrestling player? Nah... Those things may perhaps have impact on kids but look ridiculous to any other (more mature) audience. Heath Ledger's performance is good, in my opinion the best thing in this movie. I liked his performance when the Joker is coming out from the hospital before the explosion, when he walked in a very strange psychotic-way, dressed like a nurse. Ahaha, I liked his mimic! I put 1/10 on this movie knowing that it deserves probably a 7/10 to reduce this insane over-rating.",0
"Many people think this is one of the best films of the 21st century. I'm here to assure you that it most certainly isn't. Is Heath Ledger excellent in his role as the Joker? He certainly is, but who cares? This film is so muddled in its own self-importance and at the end of the day, the only thing it truly accomplishes is patronizing its audience for two and a half hours. JUSTICE! LAW! ETHICS! BATMAN!!! Yadda-yadda. Translation: bunkum and hoopla. This film would certainly only have the reputation that it does in our current society of grown children who think that superhero comics are on par with classic literature. Enough is enough. This isn't a great film.",0

"So... What I'm getting is there's this Dominatrix running around with a cape, funny ears, and a husky/scary/arousing voice. Who also beats up guys in parking garages, but none of them got aroused, so the story didn't go anywhere. She probably should have whipped them. also there was this rich guy who it showed a lot, but he didn't really have anything to do with the story. It was strange. But on the other hand there is that buxom green haired lady who gets beat by the Dominatrix and then dresses up as a nurse. I'd buy that for a dollar. Anyday. I think the Dominatrix probably should have got slightly naked, she's got some big pecs if you know what I mean and I would have liked to find out if the carpet matched the drapes. Like, That's the stuff I would bump into on the street ""by accident"". That Gordon guy had a moustache that made me wonder... But I digress, there was a lot of teasing, without any climactic moments of trepidating fulfillment, or masochistic zeal. I was appalled, disappointed, and, finally, ashamed. It almost makes you wonder how director Christopher Nolan even thought he was making an erotic film.",0
"Should have been titled The Joker as his character is the only interesting thing in the movie.Hokey fight scenes,Batman talking under his breath in every scene.Plot was typical crap.Joker was good for the most part.The district attorney was a joke,his g/f was sleeping with him and Batman at the same time(this is good ideas to put in our kids minds eh?)This movie got a whole bunch of PR but did not deliver,luckily for the movie creators there are a lot of ignorant people out there willing to pay for this garbage.Christian Bale lowered his integrity as an actor with this one.Ironman and Spiderman 3 are so much better than this its pathetic.If Heath Ledger didn't die during the filming i wonder how many sales it would have made.",0
"Well, maybe not.I won't bore you with any of the plot details, believe me when I say The Dark Knight will do this for you. Tedious, that's one way of describing this film. As well as insipid, dull, uninspiring, boring, and yawn inspiring.I seriously can't believe the ridiculously high scores given here. Did we even see the same movie? I'm starting to think not.The one I saw was achingly long, had A-Team level violence (you know, explosions and a lot of shooting but never any blood), and a hero who disguised himself by adopting a stupid 'I'm disguising my voice so you'll not recognise my lantern jaw' voice. Heath Ledger was okay. As in OK. As in not great. I half suspect that the only reason people are gushing over him is because he's dead.Anyway, this film has a LOT of flaws and certainly isn't anywhere near the masterpiece it is touted as being.I'll give it a 6/10 for some solid cinematography, -1 for being so damn boring and another -1 for failing to live up to any of the hype.",0
"First let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star. My real rating would be a six to an eight (depending on your taste in movies) but I had to compensate.Compensate for what? Well, literary device, I'm glad you asked. Tools?the answer is tools. No, not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver. I'm talking about people, people who are easily swayed by other people's opinions and by mass marketing campaigns. Unfortunately, almost everyone in America (including myself) is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool. Now I realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots. If they have ever given The Dark Knight 10/10 stars or referred to it as ""one of/the greatest movies of all time"" well then Lil Miss Daisy I'm afraid you have a huge tool on your hands. I recommend immediate euthanasia.Why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews, I simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews. It's quite simple really. The media told everyone they should like?so they did. These people then went out and told their friends that they should like it?so they did. And these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like it?so they did. So it went until one day TDK topped the list of IMDb's greatest movies of all time. What it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage. Had the initial media coverage been negative and Heath Ledger (God rest his soul) not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for Hollywood this never would of happened. Basically what I'm saying is someone told you this movie was good, so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws. And while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet I feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess. Too many people told you it was good. You went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws. This movies current average (9/10) is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified. It's an OK movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted.",0
"This is the second worst film I have ever paid to see in a cinema. (The worst was Zoolander) Where to begin? The ersatz brooding music, the inane plot, the ""heavyweight philosophical dilemma"" posed by the two ferries episode, the overacting, the deeply pathetic ending. There was much made in the British press about its violent content, and the (un)suitability of its certificate - after seeing it all I can say is I didn't find the violence objectionable, but emerged thinking that perhaps a new certificate is needed for the irredeemably crap. Avoid!The tragedy of this, and what personally makes me angry, is that directors like Loach and Leigh could probably have made ten films on this budget, even someone more expensive and supremely talented in the fantasy genre like Gilliam or del Torro could have made several. What a waste.",0
"****WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*** This movie is a monumental disappointment. I had seen all five of the previous Batman movies on the big screen, and I watched as they kept getting worse and worse and worse. I hoped that this one would break the trend (and with all the raves surrounding Heath Ledger's ""great"" performance, I really thought it would), but it did not. This movie is so trite and so absurd, and what is most reprehensible is that it suggests that there is no Good vs. Evil anymore?as a matter of fact the movie closes with Batman himself being chased by the Gotham Police(!). And constantly throughout the movie Batman (now suddenly called ""The Batman"") is seen as being the reason behind all the murders, robberies, and destruction the Joker is perpetrating in Gotham City. By the way, Gotham City here does NOT at all look like the Gotham City that we know; it is Chicago pretending to be Gotham City, which is very boring. What happened to the stunning production design that Gotham City is supposed to have?!! As for Heath Ledger, he makes a great impact in one of his first scenes in the movie (when his sudden killing of a gang member serves as the punch line to a joke), but after that scene the Joker's energy totally dwindles away and he becomes another smart-aleck, philosophical killer?and even downright boring. In an attempt to keep things entertaining with the Joker, the movie resorts to dressing him in a nurse's outfit (a cheap laugh). To make a quick comparison, ""The Dark Knight"" is very much like ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (and a million other movies) in that everything is on the verge of complete destruction and chaos at the hands of a villain, and like Die Hard 4 (When are needless sequels going to stop?!!!!) it tries to replicate the feel of 9-11?a real-life tragedy that should not be incorporated into comic-book stories like Batman. Batman himself makes a pathetic showing in this film, as he is much clumsier and more ineffective against the villains than ever before. But then again, why should he even try when everyone is calling him a ""vigilante killer""? When I was eight years old and saw the first Batman movie at the theater in 1989, seeing my favorite comic book character brought to life in such a stunning way was a dream-come-true. Had ""The Dark Knight"" been the movie that was released instead in 1989 (especially seeing Batman getting chased by the cops at the end), I would have been devastated. Now as an adult, I can honestly say I am disappointed.",0
"I went to see this movie with no expectations at all, because I'm not a fan of Batman and big budget Hollywood movies usually disappoint me. Although I think this movie is totally overrated, I liked the Joker character played by Heath Ledger and the story was OK too. The film itself was week in my opinion, it depended too much on the action and it didn't deserve to be titled ""The Dark Knight"" at all. Tim Burton's Batman was much more dark in my opinion and there was more of an artistic element to it while TDK was just an action movie. Despite of all, I completely understand why people like it. This movie has enough action and special effects to entertain most people and a pretty good story for an action movie, but I certainly think that it doesn't deserve to be third in IMDb Top250.",0
"I believe if Heath Ledger had been alive this would have been maybe a 7/10 and his acting was good but not great and anyway he played second fiddle to Christian Bales Batman. To be honest I think and have talked to people who think it fantastic and then some that hadn't heard of Ledger's death and interestingly these people gave him about a 6-7/10 for his portrayal of ""The Joker"" Whilst Ledger is a great actor and will be sorely missed I think that this being his LAST movie and all the emotion has boosted it up.The same thing happened with James Dean with his blockbuster and last movie ""Giant."" Ledger was a creepy joker and did well to play his part but I think the fact that he was dead made people look at him all throughout the movie and not other actors. Good Move RIP Heath Ledger, a sad loss to the industry",0
"THIS MOVIE IS WEAK! Unfortunately, this film fails to deliver the same way Batman Begins did. The characters were mishandled (Nolan should do MORE research) and the acting was unsatisfying. Ledger did great, only he was NOT the Joker. The man hardly giggled. I'm sorry, but if you're going to play someone like the Joker, DO NOT go off on a tangent and try your own thing. In a medium like comic books, they're different from books in terms of we get visuals. We know EXACTLY what the Joker is supposed to be like. Ledger dropped the ball big time and Nolan should have done something about it. CELL PHONE SONAR?????????? That was awful. Two-Face looked good and Eckhart was an awesome choice but he had very little to work with. They should have given his character the attention he deserves, meaning his descent stemmed from his childhood, not his damn relationship with his co-worker. Gordon could have been good but he wasn't. Apparently he had to die to catch the Joker. WHAT? The ruse was mishandled. Let your audience know what's happening. Batpod? Whatever. NO BATCAVE???????????? Michael Caine plays an excellent Alfred only he had nothing to do. Does anyone recall the whole thing from Begins about Why do we fall? Apparently EVERYONE forgot it in this one. Everyone had a moral dilemma in this and that's fine, but WE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE FIRST ONE!!!! This is a damn superhero movie and why do people like superheroes? Because they beat up the bad guys. The fight scenes are poor at best because the camera is too close and YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING. I want to watch Batman kick the hell out of an army of jerks, not have it implied. These scenes were the weakest part of the film. Batman films, whether you agree or not, should have scraps like the ones in City of Violence or the hallway scene in Old Boy. THOSE ARE FIGHT SCENES! Does anyone know the plot of this film? Look, I know the Joker was supposed to be insane and never plan a damn thing BUT THERE WAS NO CLIMAX! Every scheme amounts to nothing and in the end of the film, THERE IS NO MOMENT OF TRIUMPH FOR THE BAT! Especially since they locked him up once and THE JOKER GOT OUT! WHY IN SWEET HELL WOULD THE JOKER BE AFRAID OF INCARCERATION?????? Plus, the scene at the end with the boats was a little too far-fetched (I know that's a risky thing to say since this is a film about a man who dressed in a rubber suit to fight crime). I mean, I just don't see people blowing each other up, especially when the National Guard is involved. WEAK! And back to that cell phone sonar thing: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!!! BATMAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DAMN DETECTIVE!!!! WHY HAVEN'T YOU DEALT WITH THAT???? HE DOESN'T NEED THE DAMN SONAR TO FIND JOKER!!!!!! Ultimately, what kills this movie is the writing. Awful!!! David S. GOYER!!! STOP BUTCHERING SUPERHERO MOVIES!!! FIRST THE DAMN CROW (did you think I'd forget, dumb-ass?) THEN NICK FURY FOR TV WITH HASSELHOFF AND THEN BLADE (Goyer's third Blade, which he directed, SUCKED) AND NOW BATMAN. WHY DO THEY HIRE THIS MAN??????? People, this movie was terrible in terms of WHAT THEY COULD'VE DONE WITH THE MATERIAL!!!! If Nolan decided to do a third, he should FIRE himself because he cannot direct comic movies and TURF GOYER!!!!! There are some fine ideas in this film but they are masked by the garbage. The bank scene is great but the subsequent ones fail to deliver. All in all, I WISH I liked this movie. But if left me suspicious of a third and slightly hoping they'll reboot it again. I thought Bale was a great choice for the mantle but he phoned this performance in. If he doesn't step it up, get someone else or start over. Ugh.",0
"People who know and study FILM will all have the same basic review of this MOVIE. It's overacted (and yes, Heath Ledger is included in that remark) and just an overall horrible script. The whole ""why so serious"" bit was again, overacted, and SO predictable. I wrote better dialogue when I was a toddler. Then comes the completely unfathomable events - Nolan wanted the movie to be realistic but he clearly is a moron for that statement because only pre-teens and people pretending to go along with the hype would believe the whole cell phone bomb inside a guy's stomach. And a gun in court? COME ONE STOP INSULTING ME! The fact that this movie is ANYWHERE in the top 250 proves that people are generally stupid.",0
"I'll keep this short.I rarely go to the theater, but with the hype I had to go see this. Batman and the Joker are invincible characters. You know they won't die. Plot hole: the police have the Joker in an interrogation room, with 30 officers on the other side of a 1-way mirror, and the Joker just killed the Mayor the day before. What do the police do? Any logical person in that situation would kill the Joker. Period. Just shoot him. I nearly walked out of the theater when the Joker escaped (imagine that!) Here's the thing. The Joker isn't a serial villain here. He's a terrorist. He's Osama bin Laden. Normal rules of police interrogation shouldn't apply here. And where's the military? the FBI? This story made no sense to me. Well I tried to keep this short. I want my 2.5 hours of my life back.",0
"This is the 3rd-best film on IMDb?? Just came out of the cinema and couldn't believe my eyes! What a waste of time, money & human creativity... This is so far the worst film I've seen this year & easily the worst film Christopher Nolan has directed. Why do great actors like Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Michael Caine accept such roles ? are they in it just for the money?! That's totally okay, but then they should refrain from jazzing up this piece of crap and just say what it is ? a shallow, pathetic off-the-rack exploitation movie for brain-damaged teens. I had a hard time piecing that pseudo-heroic dialogue together ? at times it seemed to come straight out of fortune cookies; at times I didn't even know what the h**l the people on-screen were talking about... never mind the totally unimaginative camera, storytelling, action scenes... everything! Everything was just... so... SEEN BEFORE.Laughable.Enough said. Voted 1 out of 10 just for the OK & above-average acting of Heath Ledger.",0
"Against all that has been said in praise of this movie I just hated it. Can't we get back to real movies without all the special effects? I walked out before it ended and can't think of anything I really liked. How could anyone suggest Heath Ledger could get an Oscar for his performance with his face covered in make up, he went through the complete movie with one expression.It is a very dark movie in all senses of the word with little humour and a boring and predictable storyline.The same thing has happened to the new Bond movies, ruined by special effects and a desperate desire to look modern, much of the humour has disappeared, Romance is hardly there, not surprising as the females spend much of the time doing Kung Foo or shooting off guns!As for the music well all I can say is that it is tuneless, which should make it to the top of the charts!",0
"I noticed that a film I had not seen was riding high in the IMDb chart and being intrigued I bought my copy of The Dark Knight. I was fairly impressed with the special effects and the acting from the cast was good and it was clear that a certain amount of care, effort and attention had been put into the films production. Ultimately though I felt as if it was a case of a fairly good attempt but no cigar. The film could have been a classic but it simply isn't good enough. Personally I was glad I had watched it but will not be rushing to watch it again and its current position in the IMDb chart is way above where it should be. It is also clear that the film has numerous enthusiastic supporters and having watched the film I can see why. I think there are a lot of people out there who have got carried away with all the hype, marketing and advertising and also I think it may be a case of its cool to say how good it is and agree with the majority. Lets just see in say five years where this film figures in the various charts that are out there. This film is not bad but its not very good either. I am not in the slightest bit bothered about swimming against the tide where this film or any other film is concerned, if its not very good I will say so but what the hey as I have said before opinion is all and I would recommend that anybody watch it at least once.",0
"I guess I missed the warning on the label.""You must be at least this shallow to enjoy the film."" This movie had no depth, although it really, really wants you to think that it does.Michael Caine was very good in this film. So was Morgan Freeman.But everything else was just so hollow. Nothing to draw one into the characters.And then the utter repetitiveness of the whole film. The Joker is a bad guy. The message which was relayed in the opening scene was then repeated again, and again, and again, and...And yet through all of this, they couldn't manage to put forth a story that was interesting. Nothing at all. Just excuses for special effects.Not as bad as Spiderman 3, but a really, really overrated film. Heath Ledger acts crazy throughout the film, but in a very, very two dimensional way.Ironic that a movie featuring a character called the Joker failed to have any laughs in it whatsoever.The first re-invented film was good. Things happened for a reason. Things happened that were surprising. Editing occurred.I would rather watch Adam West's Batman, than this. Those stories eventually got to the point.",0
"Seriously, this movie is long, tedious and predictable, and in all honesty you cant be bothered what happens in the plot because the characters are so two dimensional.in fact, its been a few weeks since I watched this movie and for the life of me i cannot remember what happened in it...That perhaps tell you how good it was?Anyway, god knows what crack these people are smoking who have given it 8/10...IS THIS TEN LINES YET????Pope",0
"OK, while there some new effects for the franchise, this film had its problems. Like Batman Begins, it brings in the guy who wants revenge against the guy that's causing the problems. Enter Heath Ledger. I really do not think that he did a good job. I mean, the first Batman film in 1989 introduced the joker, so why bring him back? Jack Nicholson stole the performance, and Heath ruined it. The problem with the Joker in this film is his looks. Jack's Joker had a smile surgically fixed on his face. Heath's Joker has a smile painted on his face. Pathetic. The original look was better. The jokes and puns are terrible, as are most of the action sequences. Now, seriously, someone bring back Michael Keaton? 2/10 sorry, guys, but this is just my opinion.",0
"This movie is good, but not the best movie ever made. Not even close to being the best movie ever made.Why has IMDb allowed anyone and everyone to vote. This is insane. Prestige by the same director and cast is far far farrrr better.The background score is a killer. Thats what sets the mood of the entire film.The movie should actually be called ""The Dark Clown"", because the Joker is just one of the best characters played on screen, in a long long time. Heath Ledger has the soul of the character in his grasp.As for batman, where is he? I hardly saw him.",0
"Gotham City no longer has an ethereal, poetic glow. In director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to his 2005 blockbuster ""Batman Begins"", Gotham is just another Metropolitan city full of embittered residents squirming under the stronghold of Mafiosos, psychopaths, blackmailers, and terrorists--namely the Joker, who opens the film robbing a bank owned by the Mob with his masked cohorts, whom he has no loyalty to. Heath Ledger won a posthumous Supporting Actor Oscar for his twisted portrayal of the Joker--playing the facially-scarred criminal mastermind as if he just escaped from a lunatic asylum--but it isn't a multi-layered, pleasurable performance. Christian Bale returns as billionaire Bruce Wayne (and his alter-ego, a flesh-and-blood Batman), putting his trust in Gotham's latest hotshot District Attorney who is dating Wayne's childhood sweetheart and going after the Mafia in court, if the Joker doesn't get to them first. Nolan stages one extended, fiery vehicle chase that is absolutely astounding, yet the rest of his film falls a bit short. The performances are variable, the mood is dour and depressing, and the illogical plot tied in endless, headache-inducing knots. Fans of the superhero genre will no doubt revel in the sleek look of the picture, but the script (penned by director Nolan and his brother Jonathan) is a disappointment, not helped by the smash-and-grab editing which cuts off and mixes up sequences before the drama has even played out. ** from ****",0
"In the old days, film-makers told stories. Now they create effects. That tells you pretty much all you need to know about ""The Dark Knight."" If you like car chases with flashy digitization and sonic booms, you'll love ""The Dark Knight."" Otherwise, stay home and read a book.Admittedly ""The Dark Knight"" looks spectacular on an Imax screen, and Heath Ledger has to be a hands down winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. There are also plenty of familiar faces passing through the production -- Michael Caine, once a leading man, doing his by now standard Gielgud imitation as a butler, Morgan Freeman doing his by now standard role as God/CEO/Chief Technology Officer, Maggie Gyllenhall as the prim sexless object of everyone's affections, Christian Bale as the trust fund guy himself, Aaron Eckhart as an untouchable prosecutor. They meander and lurch through a plot so turgid that it isn't even worth diagramming as they face assorted actual and threatened explosions, free falls, assaults with deadly weapons, shattered windows, fires, and the aforementioned vehicle chases. For 152 minutes or so until finally, at long last, the closing credits come up, and everyone can go home.There's no magic, no mystery, no glamor, no insight, no humanity in this movie. It's all ""BANG,"" ""POW,"" ZAP,"" ""CRASH,"" ""BOOM."" And it's all pointless.",0
"It's hard to believe that this film rates in the Top 10 of all IMDb-rated movies. Sure, it deserves more than 5 stars on Heath Ledger's performance alone. But let's face it: This movie doesn't hold a candle to Nolan's first Batman effort.There is very little plot. There is a whole heckuva lot of brooding. There is dark aplenty, but to what purpose? I got so tired of it, I was ready to just have Heath get rid of Batman for once and all.The Nolan/Christian Bale combo is dynamite, but this screenplay and plot is anything but.Still, there is Heath Ledger, and he is really superb. What a loss for us all. And, as always, the movie LOOKS great, filled with the typical Nolan touches. I've recovered and I'm ready for a third Nolan/Bale effort, just with a bit more thought to story and at least some measure of action.",0
"I have to say I'm quite surprised that TDK has such a good rating here on IMDb. This movie is, without a shadow of doubt, the best superhero movie ever (at the moment), I don't think there's much discussion here, but let's face it, the standard superhero movie is a 2/10. I can understand why the masses like this movie so much, batman is a well known superhero, there's action, explosions, the plot is easy to follow, there's a love story, all the clichés. But that's exactly why the movie is just a cool summer movie, and not the best movie ever. The plot is minimalist and usually wanders off in useless sub-plots that bring nothing to the movie. Except from Ledger (that was outstanding), all the actors are mediocre to say the best. The lines they make these actors say are the final nail in the coffin, the dialogs sound fake and sometimes ridiculous, the pseudo philosophy someone tried to put in the movie is just sad to hear. In the end there's nothing I learned from watching this movie, there's nothing new in there. After all it's a decent movie to watch, but you cannot compare it to great classics, whoever thinks this is the best movie ever should really watch more cinema or maybe get a brain.",0
"Batman is a comic strip! The Dark Knight thinks it's Dostoyevsky! Over long, exceedingly tiresome and boring, one note performances, stale CGI stunts with a script that is more pretentious than portentous! Director Chris Nolan gets some marks for subtly taking the rise out of Bush and America, and convincing a very large audience they are watching Fellini, Tarantino, M. Mann and Carol Reed all rolled into one! Yes, folks, if it's dark, it must be a serious film!!!! I loved the holes in the plot(must be deliberate), when The Joker says he is an anarchist, who does not plan, but then produces several stunts that would have required Rand McNally precision and hundreds of accomplices! And please,I know he died under strange circumstances, but Heath Ledger, although not bad,is miles behind Jack Nicholson. As for the rating certificate, the British censor should be thoroughly ashamed of himself, or did he think it was just a Tom and Jerry comic cartoon?",0
"I can't believe what a disappointment this film is. Like everyone else, I too had very high expectations for this movie. I'm far from a movie snob. The only thing I expect from a big summer action flick like this is to be entertained--and I wasn't. I've very much enjoyed Batman Begins--in fact I own the DVD and enjoy re-watching it not infrequently. As I watched the Dark Knight, I felt like I was just waiting for the really good stuff to come that never actually did. The whole thing is full of story lines that go nowhere, unoriginal and uninspired action sequences that never deliver. The Joker is inexplicably indestructible, Batman is practically a bit part and the techno-gizmos are patently absurd. The only reason I'm giving this as high as a 3 is because of Ledger's performance, which was good but far from the pinnacle of acting that you'd expect from the hype. The success and acclaim this incoherent snore-fest has garnered just go to show how effective buzz and hype can be. Bottom line, this is truly a case of the Emporer's New Clothes 2008 edition.",0
"Man, what the f**k was that ! There was a time when you knew how to deliver real thrills, set like swiss f***ing watches. That was 8 or 10 years ago. I'd have followed you anywhere, memorized every bit of your films, man ! Now, you're trapped in the Hollywood prestige. That's a bummer, man! Though, I dig your style, man: the ideas you put in the story, with the help of your bro. The way you shoot. The actors (hail to Heath), the production too. I even like you trying to make this man fighting creeps disguised as a bat as real as possible, even though I don't like that treatment for such a story and I think that a film based upon a comic should feel as a comic. But, fair enough, transposing Batman's mythlogy to today's reality is pretty cool. But, Man, what a waste ! Where's your point ? Where's the point ? Why don't you push your logic to the end of it ? Why so many gaps, holes, ellipses in you're story ? Why so many useless plots ? I mean, I was really keen on seeing a REAL Batman, man, but why do you use real locations like that for instance : everybody who's at least seen Chicago once on a picture should figure that it's not Gotham here, it's Batman in Chicago. Every Londoner should figure that it's not an abandoned warehouse here where Rachel is trapped, but it's Battersea Power Station. Now you could have at least shown a chimney, damn it. And that bit in Hong Kong... lame. Looked like a f***ing Roger Moore's James Bond s**t. And why so paradoxical, incoherent: Batman hanging up the mask and then 5 minutes later he is after the smiling freak again. Did you really think we would eat that kind of script tricks ? Explain that to me, Man ! And I'm afraid, Mister Nolan, that you can't direct action sequences (and can't rip other landmark movies properly either). That score at the beginning, was an insult to such a brilliant movie that is Heat. And this truck flipping over, now, come on, tell me, you had just watch Terminator 3 when it came to your mind, didn't you ? All in all, you f***ed it up, man ! But the Dude abides, he will wait for the next one. Suggest though you do a J before. You know, take it easy, man ! Stop brain wanking a little bit.",0
"What?! Someone did not love this action-packed blockbuster? Blasphemy!I eventually watched the movie everybody is talking about last Friday. I gave a lot of thought whether I should write a review ...Well why not? I have been actively watching movies for over 35 years so I do feel I have an opinion to share.Why should I join the rest of the enthusiastic crowd, waving a red book and hailing director Chris Nolan as a genius?Now, don't get me wrong, I did not hate the movie...OK, let's start on the good bits:* The first 20 minutes were brilliant: the pace, the editing, the music, photography and dialogues...All the ingredients to prepare the audience for a good show.* Bale's portrayal of Batman is exemplary: dark, fast and furious.* Some of the action sequences were excellent including the Batcycle* And....That's it!Sure, Ledger's performance as a Joker was very good, not groundbreaking though. And yes, he certainly brought another dimension to the character. But he did not have the same impact or wicked humour (we are talking about a joker after all) as Nicholson's.For a film of this scale, there were too many 'dead time', i.e. scenes with loads of cheesy dialogues and no action. For a long movie like this one, one needs to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. Take last summer's Transformer, the film was too long for me but still kept a good pace of action sequences.The biggest problem with The Dark Knight was simple: too many characters and story lines. Sometime after the first 20 minutes, Nolan lost it: the movie was no longer about the capped crusader the film was named after but a whole series of people trying to distinguish good vs evil.The 90's Batman movies failed for the very reasons: loss of focus when there were too many characters involved.I reckon the film should have been called 'Harvey's lost it'.Do I regret watching it? No...So this film comes very neutral: some good scenes but not worthy of the praise it has received.For the record, Sam Raimy's first Spider-man remains for me the 'perfect' super-hero movie of recent time: simple, well-structured, with a comic book feel and a nice mix of dialogues and action sequences.",0
"The Dark Knight is the worst sequel since ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"". I am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re-invigorated so wonderfully with Batman Begins. I speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it, ergo people don't like it. I really think this film is the biggest dupe since The Blair Witch Project. I want to make it clear that I love Batman, Bob Kane's Batman, Frank Miller's Batman, Jeph Loeb's Batman and the DC Animated Universe's Batman. Like many, I found the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher films excruciating to watch. Batman Begins came along and Christopher Nolan gave us a Batman we could respect and understand as well as believe. We were then teased with The Joker's calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen history....and we got....a joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist, no batcave, a batsuit that looked like a riot cop, a convoluted Scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime, a Two-Face who's only motive is a dead girlfriend, a Batman we hardly see, and a Gotham City that now looks like Chicago. But the enigma I can't stomach is that the film HAD NO CLIMAX!!! I asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each time...oh it was Batman confronting Dent...no it was the Joker hanging upside down, no it was Rachel Dawes being killed.....NO there was no climax! This film's success lies only in the sad fact that it's main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film. In Nolan's attempt to legitimise the Batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring.",0
"OK--this review will be FULL OF SPOILERS so please read it at your own risk.Batman (Christian Bale) is trying to clean up Gotham City with Police Chief Gordon (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) and crusading D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). However a psychotic madman named the Joker (Heath Ledger) wants to take over Gotham (for no discernible reason) and kill the Batman. His plans get increasingly more diabolical, many people die and Batman starts to wonder if he can stop the Joker...and if he's responsible for him.OK--I realize the Batman movies are supposed to be dark--but THIS dark??? This movie is chock full of violence--people are casually shot to death left and right(but there's no blood so I guess that makes it OK). There are some spectacular stunts here but all the violence and dark tone rob them of any of the wonder they might have had. There's next to no light moments and the movie gets increasingly depressing as it goes on. And the Joker casually hurts or kills people with no warning. There's also a thoroughly despicable scene where a little child is threatened with a gun. This deserved an R--NOT a PG-13.The needlessly convoluted story doesn't help. The movie goes on far too long (lots of people in my theatre were checking the time during the last hour) and gets confusing. Characters appear and disappear with alarming infrequency and one character (the guy who was going to reveal Batman's secret identity) disappears completely with no resolution to his story! The Joker here is rightly played as a psychotic madman but Ledger is NOT good in the role. His speeches sound stilted and he's not really acting at all. His character isn't frightening--just incredibly annoying. I found it hard to believe that all these characters were stupid enough to buy his ""explanations"". Also he plans some explosions and plots that are just impossible--even in a comic book movie.Acting does help. Bale is just excellent--he's not getting enough praise for his acting. He manages to show Batman's anger and pain even in that padded suit and mask! Eckhart is just superb as Harvey Dent--and Two-Face later on. Maggie Gyllenhaal (taking over for Katie Holmes) and Michael Caine (as Alfred) were also good. Surprisingly Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman aren't that good. They seem to be phoning in their performances. Ledger--what can I say? He's WAY over praised. He was OK but all this talk of an Academy Award is just ridiculous! He wasn't that good. His death was tragic and I can't imagine what his family is going through--but a tragic death does not automatically make you a great actor.I basically found this movie too dark, too violent and even dull! Some of the acting and fantastic special effects can only work a little. This gets a 3 from me.",0
"Normally i don't read comments from others before a movie, but now i did, cause i was wondering why this movie got such a high rating. A lot of people say its fantastic and i read some people who really hated it. Im not a Bat Man fan, though i had bat toys as a kid, a long time ago, so i went in pretty open minded.I still don't know why this movie got such a high rating. I fell asleep 2 times during it. OK, I'm a bit tired lately, but a good movie sure keeps me awake.The story is kinda lame. The classical batman story is good versus bad, pretty simple and straightforward, but the writers chose to abandon this theme more or less, stating that 'good' will always turn to 'evil', given enough time. Yea, sounds pretty deep, but isn't. Go read Nietzsche. I found it all pretty predictable and where it wasn't, it was too far fetched to ever be realistic. It leans on the psychology angle to pressure people to chose 'bad' over 'good', kinda like 'Saw' (and others), but not as good as that. Actually that theme gets worn out pretty fast. The pace seems way off, in the beginning i was like ""Huh, whats all happening?"", going way too fast, other passages are too slow (prolly where i fell asleep). The art of telling a story - any story - is to take the listener (or viewer) along for the ride with all possible means. This just doesn't happen. It's not the worst movie ever, but surely not the best either. The acting is pretty OK, Freeman and Caine always deliver. Batman obviously has a cold as soon as he puts his cape on, or watched Darth Vader too often and replicates it as a 10 year old. The Joker is totally not funny and where he should portray the madness, the only thing he knows to show is to stick his tongue out periodically. Didn't find him scary at all, not funny, nor interesting. They nominated the guy for an Oscar ?!?! The only reason i can think of why that is, is cause he's dead? I'm not saying his acting is bad, but it's by far not *that* good. ""You either die a hero, or live to become a villain"", has to be made true by awarding a posthumous Oscar?Effects and stunts are OK, but nothing new or exiting.All in all its doable, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone over ~13. Gave it a 5, cause its not all bad. Maybe i just outgrew Batman.No, we're not destined to do this forever and in fact, before redoing a Batman, you need a really good angle on it. So think twice.",0
"bad parts of this movie:--The action scenes sucked, other than at the beginning. -The action scenes consisted of the joker saying something stupid, batman hitting him, the joker hitting him back and then walking away, and something exploding -In a good movie, the good guy is supposed to be a little weaker than the bad guy and has to overcome it, but batman has radar vision and can fly while the joker has nothing but a knife-This movie was not inspiring. What does it inspire me to do? Pay a British douche a lot of money so I can dress up in robotic bat suits and catch criminals.Speaking of the bat suit: -If part of batman's sacrifice is that the city hates him then WHY DOES HE HAVE A SPECIAL UNIFORM? If you're supposed to be hated by everyone, wear a ski mask and stop advertising yourself. If you are trying to be loved by the people, then you can advertise.-The movie created so many dumb unimportant plot lines and nothing ended up happening. Right after the love triangle, the girl died. That guy said he was gonna reveal batman's identity, but nothing happens.--There was so much that didn't make any sense. -How does one guy in Hong Kong do the accounting for all the criminals in Gotham? -Why is it the biggest problem in the world that 5 people were killed in 5 days? That's better than things are usually in big cities. -Why don't the gangsters the joker is talking to kidnap him? etc.-The joker wasn't creepy. There is nothing creepy about a guy wandering around in face paint and giggling. If he walked in to a bar, cut a guys head off, and then ordered a salad, that would be creepy.-A superhero should be a superhero because he did something cool. Batman is a superhero just because he's rich.good parts: -The credits.",0
"'The Dark Knight's box-office takings were recently overtaken by those of 'Toy Story 3'. Frankly, I'm not at all surprised. The Disney picture blows this away in terms of sheer entertainment. What Christopher Nolan does not seem to have grasped is the utter absurdity of the main character - 'Batman' is a nut who runs round Gotham City in a rubber suit solving crimes. The 1966 series/movie with Adam West and Burt Ward got him about right - it was played entirely for laughs. 'T.D.K.' takes him very seriously indeed - big mistake. Christian Bale is bland as 'Wayne/Batman', and Heath Ledger's 'Joker' cannot hold a bat-candle compared to Cesar Romero's and Jack Nicholson's earlier portrayals ( had Ledger not been foolish enough to die just before the film opened, I doubt whether anyone would have given it the time of day ). 'T.D.K.' also squanders the talents of the lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal ( brilliant in 'Secretary' ). The film as a whole is bleak, ugly and depressing - not my idea of a fun movie at all. I think I'll stick with the excellent Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher quartet of the '80's/90's. No more 'edgy' Batman pictures, okay?",0
"I went to see this godawful turkey because the reviews were good and I thought maybe there was something there worth seeing, but, alas, my instincts were correct: it was made to be delivered to the Faithful, who prefer their characters flattened out and wrapped in plastic against a blue screen, delivering the usual predictable, crappy comic-book dialogue. There goes another five or six hours I'll never get back. One of the worst aspects of this movie experience was the ever-present, omnipresent, ubiquitous, portentous, ominous and and and redundant symphonic music! Every single second of screen time is infused with impending dread....! Christian Bale stares longingly into Maggie Gyllenhall's eyes; tremulous, haunting minor chords. Christian Bale glances away at the darkened spires of Gotham; slow crescendo on B flat. Etcetera. I guess this film was just marketed too effectively; I was convinced, and went. The first Batman film starred Michael Keaton as Wayne, which was an inspired casting choice, much like casting Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man: it would be impossible, I think, for either Downey or Keaton to yield up a flat performance. In this case, though, Christian Bale's performance (primarily grim determination) has been flattened out to match the furniture, leaving only Heath Ledger and, of course, Michael Caine, still standing as convincing characters.Is that enough to make the film worth watching? It's up to you, but (A) I knew it was the last I would see of Ledger, and(B) the script for Michael Caine just isn't THAT good. On balance, I can't recommend it.",0

"OK look...this movie doesn't deserve one star. But it definitely doesn't deserve 10 (or even 9 or 8). The only reason I gave this a one star is to even out for all the lemmings that gave it 10. In my humble opinion this movie could fall in the 7-8 range and I would tend to say, ""OK that sounds about right."" At what point is this movie the masterpiece that deserves 10 stars? What makes this movie so innovative and groundbreaking that someone could give it a perfect score? Just because someone leaves a theater saying, ""Wow, that movie kicked ass!"" it doesn't mean that it is in the same category with movies like ""The Godfather"", ""Star Wars"", ""Casablanca"" and other movies that rewrite the beliefs of what great movies are.I wouldn't even say that ""The Dark Knight"" is the best movie in the Batman franchise, much less one of the greatest movies of all time. It's not even the best Batman with the same characters. Go back and watch ""Batman"" with Michael Keaton and Jack Nickelson and tell me with a straight face that ""The Dark Knight"" is better film and I will be content to know that the world is doomed.Having said all this, ""The Dark Knight"" was watchable and I did enjoy Heath Ledger's (RIP) role as the Joker. It is a shame Christian Bale's poor Batman character had to spoil it.",0
"a big Joke !First of all, can someone explain me why the camera is spinning like this all the time ? There is no reason to do that. Rollercoasters are fun but it never last 2 h 30. Christian Bale is not that good in this movie, and each times he uses his ""batman's voice"", it's impossible to take seriously. But why so serious ? Well...a little wouldn't hurt...and it'll never be as funny as the 1966 batman's version. The scarecrow part is not useful, so why bringing him back ? The part with the cell phone's sonar is lame, so lame you could cry... The end makes no point at all, and Bruce Wayne's sacrifice is just pointless. Well, maybe a tiny bit better than ""batman begins"", and the music is sometimes not annoying, these are the only good points. Ledger's interpretation is OK, but not well served by the rest, and the character of Twoface is too ""cartoonesque"". The balance is then pretty bad.I don't think there is any possibility in the near future to propose something comparable with ""Batman's return"", please stop trying !",0
"OK, I know I am not that well versed on all the action comics from which these movies are made, but this Batman was one of the worst films I have ever seen that is based on an action figure.True, the acting from some of the main characters was very good,the Joker by Heath Ledger and Batman by Christine Bale,(although his Batman voice gave me the creeps) but,having seen the movie four hours ago all I now remember is Car Chases, Explosions, A hospital Being Blown Up,(the noise was so LOUD I had to hold my ears)and such intolerable camera work that I became totally dizzy and had to look away. It took me a long time to know who was who..maybe I am slow to understand, but the plot was so incomprehensible to me jumping from scene to scene that I kept looking at my watch.Where was the real fun that I remember? Even that old Batman Series on TV in the 80's was so entertaining.. Robin,the Penguin,Catwoman..and the plot was so SIMPLE..no Digital enhancements...just good scary fun for the kids!! Remember the on-screen ""BAM""..""ZOOM""..""KERPLUNK""..etc?? It was FUN..FUN!!for adults as well as kids. How could kids feel comfortable watching this..a gun held to the head of a little boy!..so much darkness..and things Blown Away!! How this could be rated #1 in theaters is all about HYPE..the death,sadly of Heath Ledger, who I thought was an unforgettable Joker but a little scary for kids! I kept asking my son ""Who are the good guys and who are the bad ones?"" It really left me empty! The script was boring..the dialogue empty and the acting predictable. I loved ""The Fantastic Four"",""Spiderman"",and ""The X-Men."" They had clever scripts and good character development. In ""The Dark Knight"" ..there was none of this!Please..to parents out there, don't WASTE your money and don't SCARE your kids...this movie is boring, loud, and an utter disappointment..I do not care how much Money it has made so far!! Wait for it on DVD or do yourself a favour and PASS on this mixed up melange of drivel!!!",0
"Let me start off by saying that I hated this film. However, I'm giving it a fair rating anyway. As an avid comic-book fan, I've had the pleasure of seeing almost all of the comic book adaptations that have seen the light of the day (so far). And almost all of the films have been at least a worthwhile trip. Ironically, the highest rated comic book adaptation of all time, the film I'm reviewing right now, is pretty damn far down on that list. Everything that Burton did right in ""Batman"", Nolan did wrong in ""TDK"". TDK takes itself way too serious. I think Nolan missed the point of ""comic""-book. Comic, as in, amusement and entertainment. TDK is neither. It tries so hard to be a smart crime film, but to me it's just a bloody mess. The hero-villain confrontations simply falls flat, like a gum that lost it's flavor.Then there was the action sequences, which was entertaining enough to watch. But you know there's something wrong with the movie when you're only enthralled by the action sequences. The car chase sequence felt totally out of place, reminded me more of a trailer for a Fast and the Furious reboot. Then there was the cell phone gag, which felt totally out of place as well. ""Gotham City"" in TDK did nothing to me. There was nothing Gothic about it. Just an ordinary Hollywood city. Burton's portrayal of Gotham City in ""Batman"" was simply priceless. The atmosphere was just so good, the cinematography and editing were spot on. His Gothic approach to this kind of material is probably the best ever, the only film coming close is Sin City. Burton did it all on a $48 million budget. Nolan had a $185 million budget and he failed to accomplish this task. Sadly, he didn't learn anything from his mistakes in Batman Begins, but I guess that didn't stop people from funding him.Early Batman films were so fun to watch, and the actors that portrayed the villains, such as Jim Carrey, Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones, had such a great time, and it showed. Let's discuss the actor portraying the Joker who people praised to the skies: Heath Ledger. I completely fail to see how his performance could have been better than Nicholson, let alone equally good. Some say they were in the same league. Some say that the late Ledger was better by far. But good 'ol Nicholson will always be the true Joker to me. His portrayal of the Joker is probably one of the most accurately portrayed comic-book villains translated to the big screen, ever (some plot lines regarding the Joker was changed but Burton kept the character pure and original). Every single movement he made reflected something of his character. Heath Ledger's Joker was just a mad dog, as stated so many times during the film. Nothing more. His motives are unknown. In the original film, we are fully aware of the Joker's motives, and through flashbacks, we learn how he became such a gruesome monster. He's so fun to watch, not to mention that he actually laughs. Heath Ledger never even smirks (wait, a Joker that doesn't even laugh?) He doesn't pull any rabbits out of his hat like Nicholson. He just blows things up. He's just a sadistic nihilist and not a complex, unpredictable villain formerly known as Jack Napier. I hated how Nolan changed this character completely, if it was at least half as accurate as the original Joker, it might had been more interesting.Two-Face was an OK villain, but suffers from the same faults that the Joker had: he doesn't have any real motives! At least Tommy Lee Jones was fun to watch. We're never let into his head; at one point he is the good guy, and at the next he's the new villain. Why? The relationship between Rachel and Two-Face was laughable, the fact that he wanted to die for her was ridiculous. The fact that he wanted to blame everyone for Rachel's death, and use ""chance"" as an excuse for killing people was laughable. I wanted to know what happened in between. The characters in this film are simply not developed enough, which makes them boring and uninteresting. This problem wouldn't be as big if the movie didn't solely rely on (failed) tension and atmosphere. Without adding a pinch of entertainment, which is what a true comic book adaptation should include, the movie falls flat. And it doesn't have to be ha-ha entertainment, Sin City had both atmosphere and action, and succeeded at both; The Dark Knight had failed atmosphere and little action. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman all provide great screen presence, as always. And then there's Christian Bale, an otherwise excellent actor, who lost a lot of credibility to me after taking on the role of ""Batman"". What an awful choice. What a cringe-worthy performance. Keaton is without a doubt, the best Batman so far, while the rest are circus clowns compared to him.As a final conclusion, I cannot recommend this film. Lacking elements that a real comic book adaptation should have, such as visual effects and accurately portrayed villains that are actually interesting to watch, the only redeeming values are some of the actors who did an OK job, and a few of the action scenes, notably the sequence at the beginning. Christopher Nolan is a great director, who still manages to show his skills in this film, but sadly, the benefits are for naught. The film succeeds a few times at creating, stylish, tension scenes, but those few tense scenes are far from enough from what this film could have (and should) have been. ""The Dark Knight"" was a huge disappointment to me, and should have been a huge improvement upon Batman Begins. I'm glad I didn't see this film with high expectations.Moose finds this film worthy of a 7.",0
"When a write this, this farce of a movie is ranked 10 in the top 250. Has anyone who rates this movie so highly actually seen it? The timing in almost every action is so unbelievable wrong. Anything happening a split second earlier or later would not have lead to the outcome portrait in the movie. I love comics and the don't have to be logical. But if you a make an illogical movie please make is obvious that you are making a farce. There is no logic in a house that just has been raided by the thugs to be proclaimed as ""the safest place in Gotham"". just a few scenes later. Don't make everything as realistic as possible, make a comic-movie. The badman-series where lovely to watch because they understood this to be true. OK, the acting is not to bad but almost all the action is horrible predictable.",0
"A few arguments to show how mediocre this movie really is: two ships, having the choice of killing each other, or being killed. If every ship will be blown up at midnight anyway, what kind of choice is that? It is certain death, so pushing the button seems the only choice you have. The only way to survive is to push. It is no real dilemma. The weakest Batman in history. Being saved several times by humble earthlings. Carrying a suit that is not up for dog bites but yes for bullets? Further: the least interesting. Where is the psychology?Morgan Freeman's character: the whole city is burning, hospitals are exploding, people on ferries about to kill each other, and he's making a point of privacy? How can a joker have no sense of humor? Scary at times, he is as flat as a penny. A bit of humor, the dark one that is, would have made him really dangerous. Now he is but a nut. The whole point of a joker is that he is bad as hell, but charming too. He makes you fall in love with evil. Ledger did excellent with how little he was given.Harvey Dent: turns into a revengeful monster in seconds? Psychologically so empty: first all he wants is good, then all he wants is revenge. 'They took her away from me'. Such a stereotype.Chris Nolan seems to be: humorless, wanting to distract the viewer from a hollow story by means of flashes and effects.",0
"You'll like this movie... if you're between 8 and 15 year old. In USA the age bracket can probably be extended to 18. I need to post minimum 10 lines of text here to be accepted as a review, but I'm not sure I have that many words about it. It had the same puerile plot as all super hero movies with an attempt of Shakespearean twist. The hero going to the deep voice when behind the mask (so people won't recognize him?! how about the crocked teeth?) wanted to be theatrical but to me it seemed ridiculous.I think the effort to make it a somewhat sophisticated cartoon produced a move too dark for kids yet too childish for grownups... but of course I am wrong based on the number of votes here that put it on the top 10 all time :)",0
"When this film came out, I initially expected it to be just as good as its predecessor, or better. I found Batman Begins to be a very enjoyable movie, with likable characters, terrible adversities, and a fittingly dark atmosphere.After seeing The Dark Knight, I don't see how it can compare.The main problem for me is that this film turned out to be another mushy, woe-is-me pseudo-epic in which the hero does little more than gripe about his problems. Granted, every hero can and should face problems of all sorts, as that is what a story is all about. But all Bruce Wayne does in this film is monologue about how his alter ego has become a new villain (which I never understood) and how he is considering hanging up the cape. So much whining and so little crime-fighting makes Batman look weak.Heath Ledger did a fine job portraying a crazed psycho-killer, but I have to ask the question why he bothered to play such a deranged character at all. I saw the Joker as a villain with a sense of humor, who did terrible things to the citizens of Gotham while throwing off rather lame one-liners and laughing crazily. Ledger's Joker has no sense of humor as far as I could tell, and there is not a single one-liner (lame or otherwise) to be heard. The only time Joker ever laughs is when he is about to cut into another victim or when the Batman is kicking him around the interrogation room: one of the few scenes in the film where the Batman really does anything.Heath Ledger's Joker is also all-powerful. He engineers enormous schemes, almost all of which involve rampant use of explosives, and pulls every one of them off without the slightest snag. He's always at least ten steps ahead of his enemies throughout the movie. The police mindlessly fall into every trap he sets for them almost as though he could see into the future and therefore act accordingly. The Joker is never really stopped, either: in the end, the writers really leave his character hanging... literally.In between Batman's depressing homilies and Joker's demonic mischief, the rest of the film's uncomfortable length is packed full of purposeless explosions, graphic deaths and a cool but needless car chase, all of which do nothing to further the almost nonexistent plot. And to top it all off, in the end Batman flees from the police into the shadows in one of the most confusing endings I've ever seen. The film plays out like a nightmare, not only because it is filmed in such a manner, but because it leaves the viewer with the depressing message that, at least in Gotham City, evil always triumphs over good.In summary, it is a nightmarish and overly long film that could have been a lot better. Great special effects, no plot.3/10",0
"To be honest this movie has the same plot-line played over and over again until its done till death, i liked the first new batman film more, although many people liked the pace, i thought it was actually very slow. Heath Ledger plays the Joker OK, but nothing special although the joker clips were a lot more interesting than the batman parts. I think this would have been a great movie if they had shortened it and stopped overusing that climatic building sound over and over again. I feel that the next batman movie will not be so great, and why is everyone making movies about superheros's ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------",0
"At most this movie is only popular for 2 reasons: its Batman, and Heath Ledger died after the making of this film which in turn made it a pity movie much like 'Queen of the Damned' did for Aliyah. At first I believe this movie was taking a very exciting and enriching role in the modern and 'realistic' feel most of the new super hero movies are trying to do. But somehow, they tried too hard.We all know that Heath Ledger died. He died of an overdose at a famous twins' place. Does that mean I have to like a bad movie just because he plays the joker? He really did do a great job but the script it self and the drawn out plot just kills the move. I honestly thought it ended 3-4 times around the hour and a half marker. Too much for one movie makes it a bad movie. Try making 2-face the next villain in the NEXT movie.Most say this was the best movie ever. If it was so great then tell me why without saying anything about Heath Ledger and his great performance that everyone already knows. Without mentioning that this is indeed a Batman movie remake made to look real and modern. Nothing about the length or the script or even how it drags on and on? Good movie. Only if you watch the first hour and half.",0
"I have to say the hype about this movie was much bigger than it should have been. I found it quite confusing that the story was quite hard to follow and the cutting was not good at all in my opinion.Christian Bale didn't deliver again, for me he doesn't seem like a good actor at all, you can actually see that he's just trying to act in most of his scenes, nothing original there, he's just saying the lines he has to say. Almost no emotions at all. And it was quite funny how drastically his voice changed when dressed as Batman, it was ridiculous.The only thing (the only person) who saved this movie in my opinion was Heath Ledger, his performance was quite good, he was intense, you really felt entertained when he stepped on the scene. Watching him play as the Joker was the only good part of this movie in my opinion. he actually sort of waked me up when he appeared, those where the only parts of the movie when everybody was strictly paying attention to what was happening.And I don't really know why didn't they stick with Katie Holmes as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal to me wasn't pretty at all, and she's not as good as Katie anyway... That was so disappointing for me.To sum up things, there were couple of good scenes in the movie, but it was too long. And if you feel like the movie is too long, that means the viewer loses interest in the story while watching, well that's what happened to most of the viewers in the cinema as far as I saw it. The flow of the movie was also not really good, it was hard to stay focused what was exactly happening in some scenes and why was it happening that way.Even Batman Begins was better than this movie...",0
"I really can't understand why people are gushing about this. The movie was overcomplicated, overly-long and, frankly, quite boring.The set-pieces were a mixed bag, i'll admit, ranging from the ludicrous Hong Kong escape (where the plane managed to out-fox the entire Hong Kong airforce) to be glorious (the truck trip). However, I had serious issue with the fight sequences. Almost every combat sequence (Batman Vs The Bad Guys) was overly-jumpy, with hardly any clear view of what was going on.The Scarecrow appearance was a bad joke. Two minutes of screen time and no follow-on? I was fully expecting him to turn up later. This was a criminal waste of an opportunity as The Scarecrow really has the ability to throw an extra level of chaos into a situation.Two-Face 'turned' in the last 15 minutes, when I was already glancing at the cinema ceiling wondering when it was going to end. However, I will say that this character (Harvey Dent) was the most interesting of the entire movie. Without doubt.The Joker was not the central character to the movie, as you would believe based on the hype. That honor, IMO, went to Harvey Dent. However, The Joker was played in a suitably crazy, off-the-wall, manner.Batmans throaty voice was verging on the ridiculous, especially in overly-long scenes of dialoge, as they were towards the end. In Batman Begins his voice was relatively controlled but raised and deepened when he got angry (and amplified with The Scarecrow). In this, it was a constant, irritating growl/scratchy throat noise, even when he was speaking to Rachel, who knew his real identity! How on earth they didn't catch this in pre-screenings and complain, I don't know.The plot just seemed to go around and around and around, with no discernible start, middle and end and a palpable lack of believability. How did The Joker manage to infiltrate a troop of Police without anyone noticing the massive scars on his face? How come the blades on Batmans arm-guards stuck an inch into the wood, at the start of the movie, but seemed to glance off The Jokers face at the end (leaving no scars)? How come a simple bike crash left Batman knocked clean out yet in every other scene where he takes a hammering, he's fine and can pick himself up? For a movie that claims to bring the franchise back down to earth it certainly managed to bypass many problems for the sake of the plot.The editing was also poor, with completely unconnected scenes cutting into each other in a rather obvious, jarring, manner. I noticed this within the first 10 minutes.Ultimately, I think the crux of the problem was that where Batman Begins was a focused, tight, plot consisting of a relatively small, core, set of characters, this tried to expand in all areas but didn't retain the same level of pace which left it trying to cover many more angles without the same level of detail. Any film that has me concentrating more on how my backside is aching or what the cinema ceiling looks like, proves only that its not been able to deliver enough to keep my attention focused. Where movies like Ironman and The Incredible Hulk did just that, this didn't come close.",0
"After re-watching Batman Begins only recently, I was very excited about seeing The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, the sequel was nowhere near as good as the last film. Cillian Murphy, who was excellent as the Scarecrow in the first movie appeared on screen for about two minutes and was then written off - which begs the question ""why include him in the sequel in the first place?!"". Pretty much the same goes for Two-Face. There was a lot of potential for developing this character and it all started off quite well but once he actually turned into Two-Face, he got the chance to be the baddie for about 10 minutes before getting killed off. Heath Ledger was okay as the Joker, even though I personally thought he over-acted the role at times. Admittedly, there were some good action sequences and special effects but on the whole the story lacked consistency and did not really seem to go anywhere. A good example for this is the bit in Hong Kong which seems to have been put in to give Lucius Fox a bit more screen time. In my opinion there was too much focus on cramming in as many characters as possible rather than on developing a convincing storyline.",0
"TDK is a long and tedious with themes common in superhero action movies. Some examples: 1. The hero who's not sure he wants to be one: Same as Spiderman 2, Superman 2, X-men, and even the previous Batman 2 movie.2. The hero who must chose between the woman he loves and his duty to be a hero: again, the Superman movies, Spiderman movies, etc, etc.3. The theme where the characters have to make a choice between two unappealing options: Every SAW movie.4. And of course, the hero as martyr. ""Why is he running Daddy, he didn't do anything wrong?"" ""He has to son. He's the hero we need but not the hero we want."" Oh for the love of....blah blah blah. This was the entire theme of Spiderman 2.Waste of time and over rated. Come on folks. Let's demand a little more originality in our movies!",0
"Let me first say that I myself am surprised for only giving it 4 stars. When I first saw this film, and first reviewed it I had given it 10 shiny stars...However upon my second viewing of it, something turned me completely off to it.Now, in all honesty this movie for me could be looked upon like a very expensive sushi dinner: Everything is beautiful: All the players involved were amazing. The scenery was incredible, the dialogue (with the minor exception of Christian Bales' 9000 cigarette a day Batman voice) we not over the top in any way. The story line was well thought out, and well played.I mean from that standpoint you really can't say anything bad.It had substance, and wasn't just all fluff. It really was a 10 star film! So why do I only give it 4 stars? Well, like any high class restaurant, appearance and presentation, and quality of the food is simply the the beginning. And this film had it all, really it did.However, it lacked one thing for me, and that is...Taste...It simply left a bad flavor in my mouth and it took me the better part of a day to figure out why.With a film that is so incredible on every level, it did exactly what so many films before it has done, and failed miserably at every single time.Trying to fit in too much.The ""more bang for your buck"" mentality.I was simply enjoying Heath Ledgers performance, and honestly did not seem him on the screen anywhere. He was Joker all the way. Sinister, psychotic, mad. Simply amazing.But where it killed it for me was with Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Yes he acted it well, yes the makeup artists were phenomenal. I mean everything about him was good.Except that all of his character should have been saved for Batman 3! Partway through the movie, it almost seemed that The Dark Knight could have ended, and another film began.It wasn't one particular point per say, but more of an overlapping of ideas. Here we are following the Joker, and then the Joker's story starts to overlap with Harvey Dents story.Like Venom in Spider-Man 3, Harvey Dent while integral to the story became an after thought.A very strong after thought mind you, but an after thought none the less.They could have done so much more with his character and the end result of The Dark Knight could have very easily been incorporated more into a third film.But instead they chose to cram as much as they could into one film, and there you have it.Had I done it, I would have had the transformation of Dent as the cliffhanger to the Dark Knight, and made an entirely different story line based more on Dent/Two-Face in a 3rd film.It is this reason that the film left a bad taste in my mouth.Petty? Over reacting? Nit Picking? Maybe so, maybe not. However, as most avid film viewers know it usually only takes one thing to screw up a great film, and for me, this was it.",0
This movie was so lame. I can't believe how many people think it's a great movie.,0
"Sorry, But this movie was trash! Had a few good moments, but that's about it! A waste of over two hours of my life I won't get back.Time to put Batman to rest!Heath was a good actor, But sorry. His performance is NOT worth a Oscar NOD.Let Heath RIP!!There are far better movies and actors out there that deserve the Oscar NOD.I am just glad I rented the movie and did not waste time and money paying to see it in a theater.I was never so happy to see the credits roll up before!",0
"I gave this movie a 1 to balance the media hype and sheep that placed this movie so high on IMDb ratings.The movie was absurd and far too long. Given the ratings I was really expecting something special. Its a shame this has been voted a 9 above some of the more deserving movies...A few scenes really killed it for me. The bike with balloon tires that rides up an bounces of walls was madness. The blue eyes that could see the cell phone signals... ouch! The car that jumped between the missile! Nice, but NO! And that painful voice. Did I mention it was far too long?I hope more people vote and leave this movie with the 5.0 that it really deserves.Filter by geography might help to keep it real.",0
"Don't worry-- this review doesn't contain any plot spoilers. You can't spoil a movie that doesn't have a plot.As I was walking out of the theater I asked another man who had just seen this movie, ""What did you think?"" He said, ""I liked it."" ""Why?"" I asked.""There were really good performances in it,"" he said. ""And the special effects were great."" This made me feel a whole lot better. The moral perversity of this blockbuster movie which had sold out all shows at the theater I saw it at, which is breaking box-office records, and which was applauded by the audience at the end, apparently went over the head of the audience. I realized nobody actually expects good storytelling or anything approaching moral rectitude from a movie anymore. Moviegoers are happy if the movie has high production values.Look, this movie lives up to its hype. Heath Ledger's final performance is brilliant. The movie is a spectacle from beginning to end. Things blow up and cars fly through the air. Lots of people are killed in creative ways.I started yawning about halfway through its 152 minutes.It's not that there isn't good versus evil in this movie. There are scenes that any member of the clergy could use to illustrate a Sunday sermon.The problem with this movie is that there is one and only one character who has a clear and consistent moral vision, who is heroically dedicated to his chosen mission, who is strong and resourceful throughout, who is always one step ahead of his opposition.Where's the problem, you ask? The problem is that this character isn't Batman, who is about as morally tortured as Hamlet. The problem is that the only character with any moral certainty in this Batman movie is the Joker.True, the Joker's mission is the generation of chaos and random destruction. He tests the moral fiber of the heroes and by the end of the movie has compromised all of them.I commented to a friend while walking out of the theater, ""I hate this movie for making me feel as if I'm living in Germany in the 1920's."" He answered me ""That's why I love it. It's a documentary. You are.""",0
"Just like the joker, I am also a little curious about the primitive nature of human beings in our society. Not that I'm immune myself, but it always amazes me to see the exponential effect of hype... to watch humans horde into a frenzy of blissful ignorance.Let me make myself clear. Heath Ledger's performance alone is worth the ticket price to see this movie. He is stunning and he destroys JAck Nicholson's performance... and I say this knowing that I had previously thought, no one can do joker as good as Jack Nicholson.But Joker is only a third of this movie, and a shame in hindsight.The rest of this film is a just mish mash of tension, pace, plot and action.1. Christopher Nolan struggles with action scenes. They are confusing, chaotic, and illogical which culminates into an underwhelming visceral and cerebral experience. Somewhat boring.2. Batman is a lifeless and dull character. In 'batman begins' this was OK because he was mostly swinging from the corner of the screen, like a predator, but given a more open role, Batman in a cape was distracting. His metamorphosis as batman was absorbing to experience in the first film, but the conflicts he faces in this sequel pale in comparison. Batman is too sensitive and too poetic in his choice of resolutions. Ready to reveal his identity too quickly and ready to become a dark knight based on the pompous premise... Dent must remain the white light.3. Two face is an oddball. An oddball of creation, of reaction and of evolution. His arch is a forced effort by Nolan. It doesn't make sense for him to kill Gordon's family. Dent himself commented that he knew his job was dangerous. He knew that there were bad people after him. Why the sudden transformation when this happened? The transformation of Two face was based on the premise of his philosophical awakening.. That to believe in chance... is to believe in chaos... but i cant believe this would cause such an explosive change in him... willing to kill a child. It doesn't make sense. Two face as caricature was not near as engaging or entertaining.4. The pacing of this film is poor. There are moments where it is too fast, and moments where the film is too slow. Effectively, I think the movie should have ended sooner. It dragged out, and I was mostly non-responsive to the conclusion of two face.5. Ultimately for a movie to be amazing one must come out of a cinema and be amazed. I didn't like the movie in its entirety. And I truly believe that had Heath Ledger not been involved in Dark Knight, the general consensus would have been a lot different, and the flaws a lot more glaringly obvious. This was a 2.5 hour movie in which everything but Joker was underwhelming.It was a good movie, but given the hype, its now everyone's favorite film of all time... as the IMDb ratings might soon suggest.",0
"I'm sorry but I don't get it. Why is everybody so crazy about this movie? Is it because of the effects? We have seen better, even in old movies. This one didn't impress me. Is it because of the story? We have seen better! The story and the characters in this movie seem to be taken from an old-days Disney fable. OK.. Is it because the actor who plays the Joker died in real life after finishing it? If that's the reason, why is that exciting? And anyway, then it has nothing to do with cinema itself! I admire the performance of the two main male actors: both Bale and Ledger play very well indeed, as usual. But unfortunately their job can't compensate for the flat performances of their colleagues, specially that of Maggie Gyllenhaal, nor for the many deficiencies of the script. The result is an unbalanced movie: the interactions between the characters is awkward, they move around in a world that doesn't seem to fit them. A bit predictable, a bit overloaded. For a movie to be a classic, it has to give you something, it has to make you grow and it has to grow in you. This movie is definitely not in this category.",0
"Tedious and boring.
To begin with, I will say: comics about Betman - those commercial attempts that come out every week - I do not like. But arbitrary variations on the subject, for example, ""Arkham: a serious place on a serious land,"" and no less paranoid ""The Return of the Dark Knight"", which was drawn by someone, and Frank Miller, and even more ""Killing Joke"" for the authorship of the incomparable Alan Moore - I can reread time after time. Especially ""Arkham"" and ""Murder joke"", and the latter can be called ""typical Moore"": he is very fond of his thoughts. Very smart and worthwhile thoughts.But the mainstream regressors never had such thoughts on the screen. Thousands of disastrous adaptations of books, stories and even poems are statistics, and there's nothing to be done. Do it ""as it should"" - they blame them for their clumsiness, their artificiality. Do it ""as you want"" - you will surely roar in the company of directors who have gone too far with pathos.And if this philosophical pathos looked simply awesome on the pages of comics painted by masters with an excellent syllable, then the same pathos on the screen, created with the help of special effects and ""original angles"" turned into cheap hypocrisy. To the director, it does not matter.Now it's fashionable to love Joker Ledger. But why? It's not the Joker. Not the CLOWN. Just a terrorist. A joker is a symbol of insanity, and pushes the masses into madness. The Joker must have a blood-stained, frozen smile. He must have a frightening, monstrously whitened skin. In the end, he does not have dirty green patches, but short, bright green hair that gives him a cartoonish look. A joker is not a person, it is a phenomenon, a symbol, and it can not be changed - its entire meaning evaporates.And then Ledger, with his desire to convey his vision, went too far. Played a bit strange - in some places it seems to be remembered at the last moment.Bale I like only in ""Equilibre"", because there are no emotions on the plot. Bruce Wayne from him nikakuschy.Meggie Dzhellenhal - a vivid example of an ugly and inconspicuous actress. Why is she in the movie? What role does it play? Did she understand this?Kane and Freeman are the bridgeodontists. They look organic everywhere. In this film they simply are - more and not necessary.Aaron Eckhart before the excellent Harvey, canon. After the zombie from the old horror, and not only make-up, but also a game",0
"This is currently the third best film of all time (according to IMDb ratings). No way, no way.The film was OK, Heath Ledger was good, but overall the film was way too long and rather over-plotted - just like Spiderman 3. Compared to Batman Begins the film felt like a safe attempt at a follow-up. Lots of big explosions, not much plot and hey a new look Rachel. To all the people that have rated this film as 7 or above, how often did you look at your watch, I know I did after 2hrs 30! Large and flabby, sorry.So go and see it, but it's no masterpiece - last point - why was Christian Bale's voice 3 octaves lower whilst wearing the Batman suit?",0
"I shall probably get blown out of the water for this, but I hated the film. I absolutely loved Batman Begins, and thought it was the best of all the Batman films. But not this one.Maybe it didn't help that our local cinema had the volume up very high, so the action scenes and gunfire became irritating; however, the whole thing grated on me. I really can't understand how it got a 12 rating, as the violence, while often implied rather than actually shown was far too much for a 12 yr old. At least a 15 rating was called for in my view.I agree with with one of the other reviewers that there was no plot other than the constant battle between the Joker and Batman. Granted, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was superb, and by far the best part of the film. He made a truly scary psycho! But that couldn't make up for the rest of the film.Maybe I need to watch it again on DVD (at a reasonable volume) but I was very disappointed as I had been looking forward to seeing it.So there it is. I'm obviously out of step with most of the viewing public!",0
"I watched it yesterday. I came here to read user comments and I was :O, No 3 movie of all times?If it wasn't 3 hours LONG I would go and re-watch it just to see what did I miss that most of you loved so much. I honestly fail to see what all this hype-hysteria is about..First of all I think the film is way too long than it should be and got to be repetitive after one point. I mean how many times you need to see Joker doing the same things to understand that he is a very intelligent maniac/schizo/sociopath/whatever and can trick and manipulate everyone? Yes we got it, Joker is a schizophrenic genius or whatever, like Ledger's irritating acting wasn't enough. Oh yes, there are many horribly given Oscars out there you will soon can add one more for Heath for probably the worst performance of his career. If that wonderful and extremely talented actor was still alive he wouldn't even get an nomination. Except if you think that talking like crazy and overusing your tongue tick to show you are unstable is a first class acting. I thought Jack Nickolson typecasts but his Joker was a masterpiece comparing to Ledger's. Its really unfortunate that for this caricature acting he will be remembered and honored.The only performance worth of mentioning was Gary Oldman's. As for the rest of the movie, directing was first class, art direction not bad, cinematography was OK, the music was good, the script was.....What was the script about again? OK its a comic so that could justify the numerous plot holes (I can't even imagine how Joker with the help of mentally ill people can trap a whole city like this, not to mention the ridiculous two-face unreal makeup to name a few..). What else the script was about? That you can only beat chaotic terrorists by bending human rights (the mobiles sonar system) but its OK if you only do it once? hmmm dangerous! That good in people always beats evil? yeah! that! it 's like ethics for dummies...but maybe this is what young people need now-days, basic ethics and values teached by a rather boring Hollywood Movie. Which now makes me understand why it is rated so high.. doh.. hmmm dangerous.. learning values from Hollywood...",0
"This ain't no masterpiece.. I mean the film is not bad, but it's far overrated.. And i believe it's not worth your time either.Special effects are great, certainly a lot of money is waisted on them. The plot is boring.. I mean I liked ""Batman and Robin"" more than ""Dark knight"".All those high rates for this film are spoiling reputation of IMDb.That is my opinion, no insult. If you have time to waist, and you are that guy who must watch everything from the film industry, this is the right film for you. And if you don't.. than it ain't worth watching, honestly.********************************************** this comment will help anyone, honestly ;) Nikola",0
"A film that can only be viewed in the Cinema. The overbearing score and use of Imax are testament to this. Also, this film would have been a 15, but Nolan wanted to break the box office records, so he toned down the violence and some of the realism so that little 12 year olds could be brainwashed into thinking this is a masterpiece. I have lost all respect for Mr Nolan at this point: This film is way too in love with itself, and for a film that tries oh so hard to be uber-realistic, it fails at many different points in the movie. Nolan was too ambitious in making a complex blockbuster, it's caught between two different worlds and remains confused about whether it is a serious gritty crime thriller, or a superhero movie, and fails on both levels. Batman Begins did the realism much better, with a better script and far better action sequences. This film suffers from poor editing, poor pacing, needless scenes, glaring plot holes, far too many improbables, and relies on the viewer suspending their disbelief for so long that the viewer will be unable to believe anything outside of Chris Nolan's Heat-inspired universe of Batman. Heath is good though, I'll give it that. But to call this one of the greatest films ever is an utter insult to every truly great director that has made far more and far better films than Christopher Nolan. A poor film that doesn't hold up on repeated viewings. I'm ashamed to admit that I preordered this ""film"" on DVD :(",0
"The excellent score, big money actors, impressive computer generated graphics and the death of Heath Ledger have obviously landed this film into a spot where, frankly in today's trendy, hype-loving, Hollywood-idealizing society, it squarely belongs. The fact that this film is number FIVE on the IMDb top 250...now that says a lot about who uses this website nowadays.Christian Bale's performance is unmemorable. His 'Batman' voice is over-produced and doubled-up to sound more superhero-ish. Maggie Gyllenhal is hardly acceptable as the film's 'belle' whom Aaron Eckhart and Mr. Bale both adore and long for. She isn't that great. (sorry Maggie!!!) Michael Caine seems bored with the whole project. The best actors are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman who don't need a big budget mess like ""The Dark Knight"" to validate them as actors. Michael Keaton made a better Batman than Christian Bale. And now, I, The Lone Biker of the Apocalypse will spill the beans and skate on a sacrilegious razor blade: Jack Nicholson made a better Joker than Heath Ledger.By about an hour and a half in, I was looking at the clock, wondering when it would end. There are more twists and turns than a full season of ""General Hospital,"" so many it hurts your neck to watch it. It comes across as being a jumbled mess in the end. Harvey Dent's fall from grace is so predictable you'd have to be a middle school student not to see it coming. And why the hell did they keep referring to Batman as 'The Batman?' That was just annoying.After all, I guess it was middle schoolers who have been on here giving this movie TEN stars. To say it was bad would be silly, but let me be frank: I am taking away 4 points just because I'm irritated at how overrated this movie is! To all you guys who told me 'you have to see this in the theater, it's the greatest movie ever made!' be thankful I was too busy last summer because I'd be coming after you for my ten bucks.3 out of 10, kids.",0
"This movie is NOT for kids. Don't even think about taking your 10 year old to see it. Batman is a cartoon, but this movie is anything but funny. It is intensely dark, and scenes of violence occur from start to finish. More than that, main characters are twisted, in the serial killer sense. The hero characters are also driven by dark motives. This movie is likely to be a source of bad dreams for children. My wife and I stayed to the end, but we left feeling depressed by the whole experience. We enjoyed the last movie, Batman Begins, but we will be much more reticent to see any more in this series. If you must see it, don't take the kids. Seriously, I think the MPAA should have given this movie an R rating.",0
"Heath Ledger and the FX for the first hour were the only redeeming things about this movie.Ledger certainly deserves an Oscar for this film, not because he's dead but because he was amazing as the Joker. His performance as the essence of deranged evil, he was astounding, this despite the fact that the writer had him pontificating on the nature of man and chaos theory. It was the physical performance that was extraordinary. The scene of the Joker prancing around in the nurse's uniform was surreal and hysterical at the same time (but maybe that's part of surrealism.Once the movie reached a point where it seemed to be repeating special effects just to do so, it lost me. It was WAY too long, repetitive & pseudo-intellectual.",0
"Are U all kidding me? Should this be considered to be one of the top 100 movies of all times? Personally I regret seeing this crap in the theater. It would have been more suitable as a decent ""sunday-hangover-movie"".I must however confess that Heath Ledger is stunning in his interpretation of ""The Joker"", probably one of the best movie-screen villains so far, but then he is the only good thing in this movie.Let me break it down for y'all:The fights sucks big time: I've seen better fight scenes on baywatch (when Mitch Buchannon takes up shootfighting). They are to short, to ""blurred"" and there are only like five of 'em in the entire 2.5 hour long movie.The acting is mediocre: Apart from Ledger the entire cast is totally underachieving. Christian Bale just reminds me of Keanu Reeves (2 facial expressions throughout the entire movie) and the great Michael Cain is in my opinion starting to get tiresome to watch as the kind, tired and concerned butler.As far as the storyline goes it might as well have been created out of a predefined Hollywood mold (which it is for sure). The dark troubled antihero who is starting to doubt his purpose, the love triangle that ""shakes the foundation"" of our heroes believes (Spiderman anybody?) and the creation and renewal of new gear and gadgets to satisfy all the ""techno/scifi-freaks"" out there. So gdm simple and uncreative its truly laughable but then what can one expect from a simple superhero movie?The only reason this movie gets a 5 out of 10 from me is its potential as a enjoyable ""hangovermovie"" the good cinematography and Ledgers performance.Ps. Would be fun to count the number of times ""terrorist"" or ""terrorism"" is mentioned in the movie? Or perhaps the number of times Ledger emphasizes how much ""havoc you can create with just a couple of barrels of gas and some dynamite"". Feels a lot like propaganda in my book.",0
"Im giving this movie a number one not so much thats it awful but that its completely over rated. You people on here need to get a grip with reality. It makes me sick to see how out of hand everyone here has become with the death of Heath Ledger. I come across many ""fans"" of Heath Ledger who tell me how great he is this movie and how he was so talented and how they were huge fans. Oddly not anyone can tell me that they have seen Candy or much less even heard of it. Candy is I feel Heath Ledgers best role. So for all you ""fans"" of Heath Ledger I recommend you take a look see at that one. Look The Dark Knight is a good movie but better than the Godfather it will never be no matter how many 10's you give this movie.",0
"This is a boring film with shallow acting (except those of Ledger and perhaps Caine)and poor story-telling. Throughout the viewing, I wasn't even moved for one moment by those ""crisis"" created by the Joker and faced by the citizens of Gotham city. The supposedly emotional reactions (which led to the subsequent hostilities and killings) of Havey Dent over the death of Rachel is so unconvincing and superficial that I felt sorry for Eckhart for having to so act as required by the script.I was fooled by IMDb's Top 250 list (currently ranking 8 out of 250 and scoring 9 out of 10 !!). I realize now what the list stand for. Frankly, if the list is not a result of a brilliant commercial engineering, I am quite embarrassed by the view of my fellow users at IMDb.",0
"Unlike their first entry in their Batman series, the Nolan brothers juxtapose their comic book characters against a well-lit Chicago urban backdrop_they seem out of place in the real world and would have been much more at home in a make-believe noirish setting.The opening scene urges us not to take any of the antagonists seriously. As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double-crossing one another, shooting one another in the back. Only Health Ledger's Joker is left standing, collecting all the proceeds from the robbery. From the outset, the Joker faces no obstacles and appears almost omnipotent.The next thirty minutes consists of a series of very slow-moving expository scenes. There's a clash between mobsters and a few Batman wannabes show up (The leader of the wannabes is later captured by the Joker and in a repugnant scene is tortured in a video clip shown on the evening news). Cut to Bruce Wayne's 'Bat Cave' which looks more like a concrete bunker fitted with large high definition computer screens (so much for the neat old Bat Cave!). Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's affable butler has little to do except impart pithy advice to his boss. Then there's the relationship between DA Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel, who Bruce has an interest in (the love triangle never seems to develop). After Dent invokes RICO laws, the mobsters agree to allow one of their own, Lau, a Chinese Mafia accountant from Hong Kong to hold all their cash outside the US where the DA can't get his hands on it. Wayne then makes his way to Hong Kong where Batman manages to break into Lau's impenetrable skyscraper, kidnap him and return him to the DA where he's placed under arrest. Of course, this sideshow has nothing to do with the main plot which involves the Joker approaching the mobsters and agreeing to take half their cash in exchange for killing Batman. After the bosses refuse to go along with the Joker's proposal, one of the bosses, Gambol, puts a bounty on the Joker's head. The Joker then gains easy entry into Gambol's lair in a body bag, only to jump out and then kill the hapless criminal by slashing his throat with a knife (the point is made that the Joker is a sadist and the Nolans appear to congratulate themselves by emphasizing that fact over and over again without regard for good taste or an economical narrative).The rest of the film's extremely convoluted plot mainly concerns the Joker's efforts to eliminate his nemesis, The Dark Knight. The Joker declares if Batman doesn't reveal his identity, people will die each day until he decides to act. When the Police Commissioner and Judge presiding over the mob trials are assassinated, the public blames Batman. DA Dent concocts a plan to draw the Joker out by claiming that he's The Dark Knight. As Dent is transported in an armored car, the Joker attacks but is captured by Batman aided by Lt. Gordon who is soon promoted to police commissioner as a result of his heroic efforts in capturing the Joker.We never see how it happens but Dent and Rachel disappear and soon turn up as hostages at a warehouse. Batman gets a little rough with the Joker in jail and it's revealed that some corrupt police officials (they seem to be all over the place) were the one's who kidnapped the DA and his girlfriend. It turns out that one of the Joker's associates who he was imprisoned with has a cell phone implanted in his chest (don't know why he wasn't put through a metal detector) and when the phone rings, there's a huge explosion and the Joker and Lau both escape. Batman is able to save the DA but is unable to rescue Rachel. Despite surviving an explosion Dent's face is maimed and now he becomes the second villain of the movie, 'Two Face"".The unlikeable Joker proves even less charming when he declares he has no interest in money and torches Lau who is tied up in a warehouse on top of a giant pile of cash. Then in the most ludicrous part of the movie, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge on all the corrupt people responsible for Rachel's death. How the good guy DA could morph into a sinister criminal so easily just proves how silly the whole story is (instead of honoring his girlfriend's memory, he too conveniently becomes a bad guy!).The finale features a bunch of convicts and upstanding citizens held hostage on two separate ferry boats. The boats are rigged with explosives (how did they get on the boats undetected?). Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act.Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book.Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitum_that criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another.",0
"Months after seeing this film, all I can remember about it was Heath Ledger as the Joker.Everything else melts away: I can't remember anything about growly Batman or lame Two Face. I remember that there were way too many characters played by elderly veteran actors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal looks like someone's elbow.And it felt like the film was ending so many times, only to launch into a whole new chapter. I know this is how comic books are written but the sprawling structure doesn't work as well in a film. The storyline was messy.Only one star: the Joker.",0
"I'm sorry but did I miss something? When did the rest of the world lose their brains? How did this film come to be the all-time number one? Has someone gone back in a time machine and deleted every film ever made before? I don't think I have felt so let down and annoyed by movie hype.Dark Knight is a complete mess and the director, editor, soundtrack composer and fight choreographer should be tied together and dangled from the nearest skyscraper until they repent. What a hideous assault on the senses. And, as a 12A, it's also got the most inappropriate rating.I went to see a 9pm screening of the film alongside a bunch of beer-bellied, thirty-something dads who are clinging to their youth by wearing crop trousers, bright-white trainers and fat laces. These guys laughed at the lame jokes and grunted in appreciation of the confusingly, overextended fight and car chase scenes, and then they came home, logged on to IMDb and gave the film ""a 10, dude, cos like it rocks, this is like the best film EVER in the world, the universe, infinity"". Meanwhile their offspring - ranging from tiny babies in carry-cots to pre-teens - bawled their hearts out in the seats next to them because they were completely overwhelmed and should have been at home in bed.The cybermen scared the hell out of me until I was 10 - so how does a child (regardless of whether they're accompanied by an adult) deal with this level of violence and noise? How is Sweeney Todd an 18 when this film is just a 12A? The former was gory but camp and theatrical. Dark Knight is just plain nasty - there's very little wit and no light and shade. My two out of 10 score is simply to thank Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman for turning up.To all the people that gave this film a 10, I say go & put your kids to bed, settle down in your sofa and watch the Shawshank Redemption, X-Men, Alien and Aliens, Heat, David Lean's Great Expectations etc, etc and then recast your vote.",0
"After watching all three movies I must come to the conclusion that this is the weakest part of the three and that my initial thoughts of this movie were right this movie tries too hard!My first problem the main villain(who has more to do with The Crow than The Joker)besides a gag or two isn't funny(for all the over the top and campy acting of Nicholson his performance is much more true to the character and maybe even more menacing than Ledgers interpretation)and though it's a solid performance by Ledger(it's one of the good points in this movie)it isn't that impressive.The city has nothing to do with Gotham City whereas in part one you got the distinctive feel of a Gothic City in the second and third movie they seem to forget why Gotham City is called that way(it's more Techno-punk or Tech-noir than Gothic IMO) It takes itself way too serious and here lies the problem if you want us to take it seriously than there has to be something as logical plots and story-line.And you have to give us more than one dimensional characters if you want us to give a damn about them(and it's not that the talent is not there with a cast like this,but it's rarely used( example Gyllenhaal)IMHO Watchmen does a far better job and maybe because it has that seriousness in it's source-material whereas Batman has not(not in it's original form that is)which explains idiotic clues,like the scene with investigation of the bullet(It's The Joker NOT The Riddler),and inconsistencies in the characters e.g. The jokers says that he's like a mad dog chasing cars and acts psychotic while everything he does is very carefully planned far in advance that you have be rocket-scientist to plan like he does(if The Joker stands for chaos then it takes an awful lot meticulous planning and order to create chaos).And the transition from Harvey Dent into Two-face is plain silly. The score; somebody put Zimmer in a straight-jacket please has that man ever heard of the expression ""less is more"" important parts of the movie are totally spoiled by the far to present score.And then the giving of musical c(l)ues when something is going to happen,as if we are idiots(when you hear the beehive-like sound)becomes quite annoying.Maybe Two-face is actually the right comparison for this movie it's neither fish nor flesh it wants to be a great action-adventure comic - based movie on one side and a serious study into justice,power,chaos, terror and control on the other and that gives the whole movie a an artificial feel and it becomes frustrating when scenes for the sake of making a point interrupt the flow of the movie.all in all it tries to be two things at once and fails at both.2/10",0
"Quite possibly the most over hyped and overrated pile of junk in my lifetime.Batman Begins was a fine movie and apart from the frankly terrible scarecrow, was an enjoyable watch.The Dark Knight was hailed as as masterpiece, I disagree. Heath Ledger was not a Joker. If it had been a villain called something else i would not have had a problem but this is so far away from the source material that it makes no sense for them to even refer to him as the joker. Jack Nicholson was better in every way. Two face was good but hardly used at all. On top of all of that the whole idea of making a film about a comic book 'realistic' is pointless, the whole idea of batman is unrealistic, just the way it should be.To all those people who say 'this film is darker which makes it better' you are all forgetting what happens, the joker actually dies in the 1989 film, no one dies in this.If you are a fan of classic batman, DO NOT watch this film, stick with the vastly superior Tim Burton film!",0
"I rented this movie to see Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance. I endured about an hour of this dreck, and, finding nothing compelling in Ledger's work (or anyone else's), turned it off before my mind turned to jelly. Admittedly, the film is well-produced, if somewhat dark and foreboding. I would have continued watching if the film was less stilted, and took itself a bit less seriously, campy and ridiculous as the material intrinsically is. But it does not go for laughs, and therefore becomes laughable.I found Christian Bale annoying, as usual, and was surprised at just how annoying Maggie Gyllenhaal (with whom I was not familiar) came across. One word kept pummeling my consciousness as I watched: STUPID! But I guess these kinds of flicks thrive on stupid. So, despite the big budget, big names, expensive CGI, positive reviews, and all-around high production values, there is still no remedy for stupid.Miss it and save your brain cells.",0
"I really don't know what went wrong with this movie. This is the worse Batman movie ever. The only good performance was Aaron Eckhart's. Now for my warning of what to expect if you want to see this movie.Christian Bale was simply terrible. His Bruce Wayne portrayal was similar to Adam West's. His Batman portrayal on the other hand sounded like he had lung cancer mixed with a rip off of Kevin Conroy's portrayal. He was good in Reign of Fire, but he was terrible in this. They should have gotten Kevin Conroy to do a live portrayal.Now for Heath Ledger as the joker. Yes, I know he is dead. Boo hoo, give it a break, he was like Cesar Romero on steroids. He also seemed like a Mark Hamill rip off. His performance was terrible. You never wanted to laugh with him, you didn't feel anything for him. Now I seriously hope that someone else can redeem this role in the live action portrayals.Now for the supporting cast. Michael Caine, I preferred him in A Muppets Christmas Carol. He just seemed to bland as Alfred in this, to much like Alan Napeir and Efrem Zimbalist Junior. Personally I think they should have gotten David McCallum to do this role. Gary Oldman, he was good in other movies, specifically Bram Stoker's Dracula. But in this once again, he seemed like a modern version Neil Hamilton's portrayal mixed with Bob Hastings portrayal. Nolan should have hired Jim Meskimen for this role. I already said that Aaron Echart as Two Face was the thing that almost saved this, so I won't repeat myself.Now for Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachael Dawes. Now I must say that she is better than Katie Holmes, so she too almost saves this movie. Morgan Freeman was unfortunately not good in this, I don't know why they couldn't have gotten Kevin Michael Richardson to do this role in live action. Eric Roberts was fantastic as Sal Maroni. He is one of the few to have given a good performance in this. Colin Mcfarlane was also one of the good actors in this.The action scenes were just going overboard. No more is needed as an explanation.The story, it was bland, boring, and colourless. I can't believe I payed good money to see something like this.Well now you know why not to see this.",0
"As much as Adam West and Burt Ward took the Caped Crusader to the goofy extreme of his incarnations' scale, this movie took him to the opposite, un-Batman-like, dark extreme of it. You leave the movie with a very bad feeling, that's all. If I wanted to see what the movie shows, I wouldn't have looked for a Bat-movie. It's just one very sad movie.Impressions aside, here is a more objective analysis: 1. Why can't screen writers just change the plot when an actress doesn't feel like reliving her role? If Katie Holmes didn't want a rerun, why just not leave her character out of the movie? Using another actress to replace her is just a very bad idea! It doesn't work. It didn't work.2. One more comic hero movie where a recurrent villain in the comics dies at his very first appearance in the movie. Hello Harvey! Adieu, Harvey! It looks like those guys can't resist the temptation of repeating that bad formula, as well as the equally bad formula of putting at least to recurring villains together in the same movie...3. Just one more Joker-movie...4. Bat-fighting: Batman Begins hit the spot in terms of choreography, fighting style and speed, but failed in what came to camera angle: you just couldn't see anything, so close the camera was and so fast was the action. Dark Knight tried to correct those flaws, but in turn the fight speed and fluidity was totally lost. It looked as if Christian Bale didn't rehearse as much as he should.5. The old problem with the cowl... Batman gained a new, flexible cowl, thus somehow solving the ""stiff neck"" issue that plagued the character since his first appearance in the movies. However, in doing so, Batman lost its famous football linebacker neck. I'll give you a hint for the next movies that will resolve this dilemma once and for all; something you've never heard before: C.G.",0
"I hate this movie. But I can deal with bad films making a lot of money and even getting praised by professional critics.What I can't deal with is the fact that it's being touted as the best picture of the decade, and drawing comparisons with Godfather 1&2, and Good,bad & ugly. That's unacceptable.The script was a mish mash of some pretty good ideas. But the writers lacked creativity to expand on it. To do justice to all the substories/supposed psychological struggles/phony moral dilemmas, it needed a runtime of 1 hour more. Yet it had many sequences which were cut short abruptly and needed further explanation.Acting was nice overall. Bale without ever evoking memories of Micheal Corleone (as some guys led you to believe) got the done as best he could from the weak script. I haven't seen much of Eckhart but he was impressive as both Dent/Two Face. Heath Ledger stole the show as Joker, but didn't turn in the best performance of the year. His umtimely death robbed Downey Jr. of the best chance he's had to get an Oscar. I would've liked to see more of Morgan Freeman who's screen time was depressingly short.Direction, Editing and Cinematography were the traits which let it down the most. Nolan's style is suitable to thrillers like Memento and The Prestige, but not for a film which says ""I want to be an epic"" right from the start. Thanks to some poor editing, some very important scenes get confusing. It's hard to make out what's happening in the scenes set at night(and there's a lot of them).An ending which had Godfather written all over it was brought out of thin air just to make us feel the film is indeed very dark and epic. It almost felt like cheating.Overall, its an over-hyped and disappointing film, which can't even compare with spiderman films, let alone the all time greats.",0
"Like most people, I am familiar with Batman. I read Frank Miller's gritty Dark Knight Returns comic in the 1980s, but also watched with glee the comic spoof of the 1960s TV series. I enjoyed the Tim Burton Gothic fairytale, and even the rather dour Batman Begins. But a few minutes into this movie, I thought to myself ""What is this? It isn't Batman!"" This was like a grumpy James Bond. And that feeling lingered throughout the film. This is just my opinion - but I didn't see Batman anywhere here. From Christian Bale's gargling caped spy to the Heath Ledger's raspy bank robber with make-up, I found myself longing for an actual Batman story. Batman would NOT do the things the does in this film - he does not let his lady love die to protect the career of an attorney. If the filmmakers wanted to see how to solve this problem, they should have watched Spider-Man. Yes, his motivations are complex, but in this film he positively revels in doing the wrong thing. He is a soulless instrument of the law - not a vigilante - not even someone interested in justice. And I for one am sick of people talking to him, turning away, then looking back to see he has disappeared! If he was that fast how come he couldn't dispose of both bombs at once?Many people have ruminated on the deep philosophical questions asked by this movie. Yet they don't make sense. The film is turgid, doesn't make it's points clearly, and contradicts itself. The message at one point is that people can make the right decisions. Yet Batman himself makes the wrong decision - as shown by what happens to Harvey Dent. And the final scene seems to contradict this point - people get the hero they need, not that they deserve. It seems the writers were going for as many profoundly deep points they could make, without bothering to string them together into a coherent drama. This is one of the few movies (and certainly the only superhero movie) that I ever felt like walking out of - especially during the Harvey Dent subplot that feels like an extra 30 minutes tacked on to the story for no good reason - and haven't we even seen this before in Batman Forever?In short, this over-hyped, bloated movie didn't - for me at least - live up to its expectations. It wasn't Batman, and I'm not sure I know what it is.",0
"Watching this Movie you get to see Batman and Two Face and The Joker. All good things, if you are into Batman. But to me it does'nt feel like a Batman Movie. They tried to make it so realistic and stuff. But thanks to it's realism some scenes are just way over the top. It looks like a Halloween version of the Godfather. Man in silly costumes fighting and trying to be bad-ass. Hilarious! Batman is a superhero! There is no need to make an realistic Movie about an Superhero! I like all the supernatural elements of the Comics and in this Movie they took them all away. Take Bales costume away and wipe Heath Ledger's Make-Up away and you have a somewhat boring Gangster-Movie. Leave the costumes and the Make-Up and you have a very boring Batman Movie. Please let Tim Burton do another Batman!",0
"I originally didn't intend to see this movie but invited out by a person I couldn't ignore I went along to see if this movie was hype driven and it appears to be almost completely the case. I am not going to waste anyone's time by commenting upon direction, actors qualities and the art deco ambiance and other such pretentious twaddle because stories are just that and this one was a largely thought free action movie on a par with snakes on a plane (which I respect for being exactly what it intends). Based on the American wrestling formula, where the ultimate victor starts off by winning then takes a pounding only to come back and win the day, it holds roughly to that formula. Still this is to be expected as it is from a comic book and so was aimed at the 10-14 age range (motorcycles with rocket launchers kinda crap - need I say more). If your of an analytical mind then don't waste your time, if your 10-14 or of that mental age then go for your life you'll love it.",0
"It seems that hype really does work for the masses. They easily succumb to what larger, more powerful entities want them to like. It's shocking and scary, really. This movie, in my opinion, and it is mine and I do not care what anyone has to say, is a perfect example.I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't bad but it definitely was not great. I liked the pace of the movie and some of the acting is OK. I did not like the joker character, though. The joker was quite boring and not flamboyant enough. The dude that played the joker did an OK job but the writing for it really fell below the waterline and I felt that the script was boring and uninspired. This was more of an eye candy movie.Christian as Batman still bums me out. He is simply not a good choice for Batman nor is he a good choice for Bruce Wayne. It just does not feel correct.Unfortunately for this movie, my favorite scene(s) involved that beautiful Murcielago with the painted six piston calipers. That was the most beautiful thing in this movie. It broke my heart to see it smashed. I couldn't help but feel that this movie minus the costumes could have been named Die Hard 5. It had that same momentum and feel.It was still a good movie. It was just not a GREAT movie.",0
"This movie is overlong by at least a half hour. I am so tired of films that have about six or seven endings. It's become a bit of a cliché. Just when you thought it was safe to get up from your seat and start filing out of the theater, another epilogue begins and you're forced to sit through at least another ten minutes of ridiculous, overblown, pretentious blather that's been well-covered in the previous four or five epilogues. Some writer/directors just don't know when to say when, and that's usually a sign that they don't have confidence in their material, nor their approach to it. This movie is a prime example of that kind of narrative drawback. But that's just the beginning of my complaints about ""The Dark Knight."" Loud, obnoxious, puerile, without one whit of wit, this movie also represents the extreme destructiveness of a relentless hype machine that's intent on whittling down our collective sense and sensibilities. The acting, which ranges from wooden to hyperbolic, seems as if it's being carried out by inter-planetary aliens who have no idea what it's like to be human. The script sounds as if it was written by someone who barely made it out of bone-head, freshman composition. I've never heard or seen so many clichés strung together in a misguided attempt at profundity and universality. As each new, cliché-ridden set piece followed another, I began to feel beaten down, as if my defenses against such obvious manipulation were being fed upon by my own desire to enjoy what everyone else seemed to be accepting so readily. Fortunately, my will to survive such cultural mediocrity is strong, and I was able to withstand this latest onslaught with my dignity intact.Please understand, I enjoyed ""Batman Begins,"" a story that was told in a simple, straightforward manner, with some minor attempts at profundity that were in line with the childish, comic book subject matter. To try and make something so ""de profundis"" about a superhero running around in a bat costume chasing down some uber-villain in grease paint and fright wig, is truly akin to putting lipstick on a pig. After it's done, you can't help but wonder: ""are they really expecting people to take this crapola so seriously?"" I'd rather see Adam West and Cesar Romero go at it, then have to sit through this load of pretentious, horse manure. At least I was able to get a laugh out of the original TV series, which was undeniably a camp classic in its original incarnation.",0
"Granted, I'm not a huge ""splosion"" fan, but walking out of the theater after just seeing this film, I am appalled. I feel like a Roman who has just witnessed a tiger maul a man. Why wasn't this rated R? Why do we as a society think movies like this are amazing, let alone acceptable? I am an English teacher; the symbolism and social commentary were not lost on me, but at what point are dramatically violent scenes in a movie ultimately contributing to more violence in our communities? What price do we pay as a society to entertain our growing need to witness this level of destruction . . . using school buses to rob banks and murder? Blowing up hospitals? Pointing guns to children's heads? This has gone past harmless entertainment, particularly when it's witnessed by younger children (there were a number of 6-9 year-old boys in my showing that ended at midnight). Needless to say, I will not be seeing a third installment of the franchise, and will be encouraging people (at least the last five on the planet who haven't seen it) to avoid this film.",0
"i really don't know what is on in this version of batman which made the record for all time box office, it was the worst. The Batman voice is very gay trying hard to be male. In every superhero movies, leading lady always be on perfect look, but not on Dark Knight. There is only one truth, it was totally dark.The story was adapted from Spider man 3.Lack of batman gadgets.Cast was boring. I can't see any good looking cast.On every fight scenes, Batman really obvious that it was handled by a real martial art expert and not the actor itself.",0
"I am not a comic book reading loser or a fanatic of the Batman films. However, I did think Batman Begins was somewhat entertaining, so stupidly I believed that since this film had made so much money in so few days, there had to be something to it. Well, there wasn't.This is a boring, slow, cheaply made movie. The entire budget seems to have gone into making the Batmobile/motorcycle, some explosions, and not much else. The city of Gotham is clearly Chicago. There wasn't even an attempt to make it look any different! One can actually see the word ""Chicago"" on one of the buildings during a scene. As for the acting, Batman's costume looked cool and no acting was really required by him. The Joker character was o.k., but his voice was really gay. And what's with the guy with the eye liner? I think he was supposed to be the mayor. Was he gay, too? He should have gotten together with the Joker.The worst of the group was the ugly woman who played Rachel (the slut that led Batman on while dating that irritating Harvey Dent.) She was so hideous I had a hard time looking at the screen. Seriously. Is there a shortage of actresses in Hollywood? What fool cast this creature? This ""movie"" is about three hours long. It seemed like ten. And for most of the time, NOTHING HAPPENS! People were suckered into this crap by the hype and the marketing. One could sense the disappointment in the crowd when it was over. I've never seen so many looking at their cell phones during a movie. People paid to be entertained and got a long, slow, stupid, boring, mean spirited, disgusting, ass-numbing piece of crap.The Dark Night SUCKS.",0
"This movie has toppled all the records and currently ranked number 1 on IMDb rankings. This really makes me doubt about how IMDb ranking works and are we the people so gullible to the advertisement campaigns that we have rated this film this high.... I must say this that the film as such is not bad. It is the best film so far this year. However it does not qualify to even come near to other masterpieces. If it is not for Heath Ledger's excellent performance, I would have rated this film even lower. To tell the truth I liked the prequel of this film better. The film is lengthy and melodramatic. e.g. the scene where inmates and civilians want to decide if they want to blow off other ship. Message was good but the way it was delivered is little bit childish. Also, transformation of Harvey Dent seems sudden and illogical. Nolan should have developed this character better. If Harvey does what he does after the death of his beloved, he should be avenging Joker. The most important part where joker convinces him to be an anarchist just like him is written poorly. All in all, it is a good movie (excuse me but far from masterpiece).",0
"This is by far the most overrated film ever , and this is supposed to be even number 1 on the IMDb 250 best films ever ? Better than Star Wars , American Gangster , Starship Troopers , Indiana series , Aliens to name but few ? On the basis of well-paid film promoters and their 'opinions '? Unbelieavable! What is good in Batman : it is , rightly centered on the character of Joker , and the performance of Mr Ledger is , rightly, great ,as he is portrayed as the sadistic scum , who likes to destroy , maim , generally blow up everything , not for some ideology , or , even worse , money, but for the fun of it ( He even says : I like simple things , like a stick of dynamite ), and other performances are also acceptable , but when the idea of a character Two face enters the spiel , the fun abruptly ends and falls into the philosophical abyss, consequently extending this film to the unbearable 2 h 30 minutes, ending with the , mind this , Batman as a main villain ?! Has Mr Nolan become a great fan of a modern philosophers like Zizek from Slovenia , where the most illogical and inconsequential is the norm ? Fie to this ! And visually , besides a minor 3 minutes of car chases with the Batmobile , there is virtually an empty space !Bring back Jack and T. Burton !And the famous bat dance with the Prince's tune !",0
"This movie was trying to be many things at once. Between the cheesy Gordon's lines and a gangster movie wannabe, they really lost a lot of the essence they build in the first movie. First of all, Batman is supposed to be a superhero. In my opinion they should have focused in getting a mix of Spiderman (which made superheroes movies popular again) with the kind of Asian mystery and wise character they created in the first movie. Now you just see a guy that can do no wrong, where you are supposed to be awed by his sacrifices. See the problem is that if you want to create a believable gangster movie, ""good"" guys have legitimate reasons to kill ""bad"" guys sometimes and they pretty much have to unless they are a priest or something. Remember The Departed? That's what you have to focus on if you want good drama. They could complement that with what the new Hulk movie (the one with Edward Norton) achieved, and then we could have a fantastic movies with one of the greatest comic characters of all time.As far as the acting goes, I don't see what all the fuzz is all about with the Joker. Watch No country for Old Men and tell me who you are really scared of afterwards. And no makeup required on top of that.",0
"Bleh. I thought 'Batman Begins' was all right. Not particularly good, but a nice way to waste a few hours. This one just outright sucks. After being hyped to death (pun not intended) between everything such as Heath Ledger's death and whatnot, I begrudgingly went to see this film. What a mess.Heath Ledger was a good actor. He did good with what he had. Unfortunately, he didn't have much here. The Joker looks absolutely horrible. The premise of creating a ""realistic"" superhero flick is outright idiotic. Superheroes were never made to be realistic. They were created for young comic book readers to escape the hardships of the real world and delve into a world of fantasy and mystique. Removing that fantasy and mystique turns it into a soap opera with masks. Basically, all we've got here are politically-fueled undertones. Yadda, yadda, yadda, Joker is represented as the terrorist threat to America, throw in some scenes of the destruction looking like 9/11 and have Batman confiscate the security of the people like President Bush and his Patriot Act. How juvenile and disgusting.So, if you life watching Heath Ledger look like a hobo wearing clown make-up, seeing Christian Bale talk like he's faking a cold, hearing Gary Oldman scream with a British accent as an American lieutenant/commissioner, and seeing Aaron Eckhart with a half-CGI head then this is the film for you! Unfortunately, millions have already flocked to it and claimed it is the greatest piece of celluloid to be projected on a screen since the concept of the movie. Shame on them.Also, Heath Ledger for a posthumous Academy Award for playing the Joker? Give me a break. You'd have better luck of Disaster Movie winning best comedy.",0
"I have read so good comments for this movie so far... and I have to say I'm surprised. When I went to the cinema I was hoping for a great action movie, as the first part seemed to me, but I have to say I found the movie very boring and was wishing for it to finish long before the end. The acting was quite poor for me and the characters' reactions and wishes didn't make much sense to me.Moreover, the action scenes where very confusing and messy and didn't flow with the plot, they where just forced in for the sake of some action. So many things didn't need (or so the director thought) further explanation/justification and broke the logic/reality/former plot with no sense.All in all, for me a disappointing movie from every point of view.",0
"I believe in democracy. Sometimes, I get scared of it. For so many people believing this is the best movie ever, I can only fear something must be wrong.This is just another ultra violent mix of action movies, with all the typical ingredients. You can even watch the hero save his love using his wings! Love triangles, car persecutions, explosions everywhere, and... not to lose its target audience, youth... not a drop of blood can be seen around. Hypocrital enough.So much lack of originality makes the movie so boring that many parents will take a chance on the intermission (maybe the best movie feature) to flee away from the theater. I confess I did.If this is the way things will look in the future for IMDb ratings, pested with promo infected young males looking for the next level in shootings and video game movies, the ratings system will render useless.",0
"This film should almost be titled ""Two-Face"", because it tries to be two different movies, and fails at both; one that presents itself as grim, depressing and adult, the other one aimed at 14 year-olds. The result felt like watching ""Portrait of a Serial Killer"" aimed at kids. Watching this big, expensive, super-hyped movie was a strangely joyless, almost depressing experience. At the end, I was as worn out as if I had watched a documentary on spousal abuse, complete with raw footage of victims being beaten while we helplessly watch.The mob bosses are presented as idiots who can't stop one guy, and the cops, who start off being competent, become more and more incompetent throughout the movie until they start to resemble the cops from the Adam West Show.Moments of silliness do not transition well with scenes of police officers being brutally murdered by shotguns at point blank range. If you want audiences to enjoy the movie on a comicbook level, then don't show graphic scenes of people being murdered, threatened with mutilation and being pushed to their death. It's these two things together that make for an unpleasant viewing experience.The moralizing is extremely fatuous: ""you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". Really? So Superman, Spiderman, et. al are due for villain status pretty soon. Firefighers and police officers if they live long enough will become criminals. Pronouncements like this in the movie sound slick, but don't hold up on examination. ""But it's only a comicbook movie"". That's the film's trouble. It tries to have its cake and eat it too.The three lead characters, Bruce Wayne, the Joker, and Harvey Dent are presented as the only competent people in the movie. Even Gordon is seen as ineffectually leading the incompetent police. Batman is the only character in the movie able to throw a punch to stop an armed gang, even in scenes of rooms crowded with men.Forcing the audience to watch long, protracted moments of the Joker holding a knife to a helpless victim's face as he threatens to mutilate her, shot in loving 360 degree panoramic closeup, is like being forced to watch a snuff film shot by Martin Scorsese. Worse, it forces the audience to participate in the victimization. The makers of the film call this being ""grown-up"". Since when is showing graphic sadism being ""grown-up""? They want it to be a ""grown-up comicbook"". Fine; then don't show the rest of the characters as being incompetent cartoon buffoons, and assume your audience is stupid; this constant shifting is playing fair with the audience.The Joker seemingly has an army of hundreds of highly organized commandos, but all of the unbelievable pyrotechnics are orchestrated by one person and a handful of schizophrenic patients. Even comicbooks have some kind of credible storyline and idea of what's physically possible, and this completely ignores them to the point of disregarding the audience's intelligence (and patience.) Finally, Heath Ledger's performance. Heath Ledger tries very hard in this role, and you can't blame him for lack of effort. He plays a twitchy, sadistic psychopath in clown makeup. But is it the Joker? Well, that depends on your view of the Joker. If your view is a twitchy, sadistic psychopath, then he has succeeded in presenting it. If it's someone who is fun to watch,with a deranged sense of humor that makes you laugh in spite of yourself, then it isn't. The Joker as presented here is as joyless as a serial killer who only feels when he tortures someone, and as irritating as a Bugs Bunny character that is drawn as one step of the good guys, defying physics and logic, so he can continually dangle victims out of windows and force the victims into making sadistic choices. Finally, this is the filmmakers' view of what this comicbook is. It isn't necessarily ours. To add to the irritation, there are long, long interludes where the Joker gives his personal commentary on life's meaninglessness, as he threatens and tortures his victims. These commentaries are presented as ""deep"" and ""heavy"", when they are in fact as meaningless, and without relevancy; comicbooks succeed better than this.Finally, we reach the end, which provides an irritation and insult to the audience all on its own: the movie actually makes the statement that the public can't handle the truth, that unless it is covered up, all the criminals will be freed and society as we know it will fall apart. Therefore, in order to continue and have hope, the public must continued to be deceived, and Batman must be martyred and chased by the hounds for the crimes he did not commit. Uh, what? Nice statement there: Bush's administration is correct after all (in fact, all institutions are correct), and we, the ignorant masses, can't handle the truth about one person, without losing all hope and reason. The idea that hundreds of criminals will be freed, and that crime will win, just because one district attorney became criminal, is ridiculous. The end actually sets Batman up to be a martyred Christ figure at the end. I found myself laughing at the end, much to the annoyance of my friend, at this ""poignant"" moment. This film took itself much too seriously, and its audience not seriously enough.At the end, the score is: Batman competent, everyone else helpless and stupid. That's the message of this film. I came to see a movie about a comicbook character, and instead was inflicted with a pompous, psychobabble morality play instead. It was not fun. And after all, isn't that what a comicbook should be?",0
"If Heath Ledger deserved an Oscar for this then why didn't Mickey Rourke win one for Sin City? simple answer is Sin city is a film based on a comic book, whereas The Dark knight is some kind of post 9/11 view of the world in which terrorist's like Osama o'Ledgers character go around blowing up buildings and sending the police and the worlds media videos or viral's or what ever the hell those crappy scenes are supposed to represent in order to instill fear and panic nice one Nolan for ruining a comic book fantasy by trying to be Stanley Kubrick or whoever the hell you were trying to be with this movie, and I am getting fed up with people saying this is how Batman should be represented just read the comic books, where's robin how the hell are they going to write the penguin or cat woman into the story it was okay with the joker because they just stole the look of James o'bars the crow and attached it to a caricature of certain terrorist's that in the last 10 years have caused death and destruction and let a film go out to the worlds media every now and then just like the joker in this film to let everyone know there still around, I can't even describe how pretentious this piece of c**p is it was okay with batman begins but with this it seems as if Nolans made a serious political statement while using the guise of a comic book that was written in the 1930's. Personally I think the first Batman film despite it's many flaws is still the only true representation of batman from Gotham city to the noir aspects and even the characters, Heath Ledgers joker is in no way comparable to the joker character Bob Kane created, and the way he played the joker was just irritating I just wanted to punch him out I found him not in the least bit scary or intimidating he just needed a good punch to the throat, if you want to check out some good performances of lunatics check out Dennis Hopper in Blue velvet Rutger Hauer in the hitcher or Gary Oldman in Leon who also happens to be the only good thing about this film, Christian bale is just c**p as Bruce Wayne and batman like he was the last time and like he is in every other movie he has made with the exception of American psycho in which he played a t**t basically just had to turn up to set and be himself. But just like the godfather this is just going to be another over hyped piece of garbage that people rave on about for the next thousand years or until some other film maker makes another batman film where he is this time played by a woman in space on a space station fighting Genghis khan because this is how far these movies are moving away from the source material this very film is based on. The film is disgusting to look at as well, at least Burton and Schumachers Gotham city's looked original (and yes I know he put the statue of liberty into batman forever but this film is just garbage) and not just like new york. They might as well as called this film heat as well seeing as it has so many shots of tall buildings in fact I might just go watch heat as it is a better made film without a pretentious plot and decent actors with a good script with well thought out direction and alarmingly a faster pace then this turgid piece of excrement, if you want my advice watch batman 1 then heat and then turn on the news after that and you will pretty much get the gist of the dark knight but in a more enjoyable way and won't have to sit through this demoralising piece of rubbish. If you happen to be below the age of thirteen or just a geek who can't get a girlfriend or boyfriend then you will probably think this film rules personally i think it is c**p",0
"I was expecting much more from this film with a IMDb-rating of 9.1 (silly me) and I was disappointed. It left me untouched and uninspired 99 % of the time. I found the dialogues and the script most of the time boring. There is a psychopathic hyper- criminal with mass destruction capabilities (BTW, he would have to hire a whole army of commandos just to place and wire all that TNT, gasoline barrels etc without anyone notice!) and the police and the Batman are trying to arrest him or save his victims, while we, the viewers, are watching their efforts for 2 and a half hours! Now, what is the point? To have fun? Sorry, it wasn't much fun. Some SFX was good and that's all. Some other wasn't convincing at all! There wasn't anything special to remember about this film. Nothing special in script, in acting, in action, in SFX and most of all, nothing inspiring and diachronic. We should demand more quality from the movies, not just explosions and killings with impossible enemies. The money we spend and especially the time we spend to watch it, should worth it! We should exit the theaters with a feeling that we have gained something special, not the opposite!EDIT: On a second thought, 3 stars (which I gave it initially) might give the wrong impression, so there you are: 1 star for your lousy film! Try harder next time!",0
"The Dark Knight..Ledger and Chicago 10, Plot and Dialogue 4 The Dark Knight is the latest saga in the Chris Nolan/Christian Bale dynasty of Batman films. We return back to gotham city where the mob has taken ahold of the money in gotham city, but only operates during the day due to their fear of the Batman (Christian Bale). Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger) a card carrying pscho-killer who teams up with and is ready to lead the mafia back from the dead by wreaking havoc on the city and luring in the Batman in for the kill (or so we think). Meanwhile an election is on for the new D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) who is dating Bruce Waynes ex-girlfriend Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Wayne meanwhile follows Maggie around trying to up-stage Dent and Maggie with his affiliations with ritzy fundraisers, 3 girlfriends on his arm and at one point taking the Russian Ballet yachting just to cancel a performance that Dent and Maggie would be attending. All of this while a beautifully shot city of Chicago provides the backdrop for Gotham City. What proceeds from here are a number of twists and turns in the plot between the aforementioned characters as their ambitions are revealed on the screen. Bale plays Wayne cocky and overly arrogant. He plays Batman with a voice that is overly gruff, distracting and almost comical. Gyllenhaal is fine as Maggie, but under developed and lacks range which is more because of the character, rather than Gyllenhaal herself. Eckart plays Dent pretty straight but like many of the characters in this film underdeveloped (aside from one). This is the joker's ace. Ledger's character is the only character that is fully developed with a proper through line. His needs and wants are well defined without having to spoon feed the audience. Ledger communicates this brilliantly without taking it over the top. Spoiler Alert Overall likability and believability is the big problem here. Not a problem if this is Schumacher's Batman, but it ain't. This is Nolan's Batman in a more realistic setting. The characters are deep enough but the the twists in the plots come before they are around long enough for the audience to identify or care about them. Even Batman has to restate what he wanted Harvey Dent to be to gotham city about 3 or 4 times, just to remind the audience. This leads to another major problem with the film, Maggie's death and the transition from Harvey Dent to 2-Face. Not convincing enough of a transition. I doubt that the Joker, who killed Maggle could and would convince Dent to get revenge and start killing people all in one scene. It is a very week plot point and unconvincing. Also, what is up with the 2-Face make-up. it strikingly resembled the skeleton of the T-1000 from Terminator. For a Batman film that wants to be realistic...sorry...totally unrealistic! The infections in the exposed bones would not hold up. Also, he flips the coin too many times which prolongs the action in a non-suspenseful way.Other points include cheesy reaction dialogue from random cast member and a tye in-to national security that tries a little too hard to make a point. All is not lost on this adventure. The actions scenes are good, Batman/Joker chemistry is very good. This is a grossly overrated film that takes one step back from it's predecessor. The question remains, is Ledger's performance good enough to garner an Oscar nomination: yes. Should The Dark Knight garner an Oscar nomination, uh...no. Some critics have related this film to Heat and The Departed. Not even close.",0
"Firstly, I wish to say that I think ""The Dark Knight"" is a very good movie. As an average Batman fan, I think that this version of the Batman chronicles balances artful pathos with run-of-the-mill mainstream icons and themes.Secondly, my goal is to make a brief point that this film has no place in the top 10 movies of all time.Thirdly and lastly, in order to make my point, I would like you to review the top 10 list below.1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994) 455,891 2. 9.1 The Godfather (1972)372,101 3. 9.0 The Godfather: Part II (1974) 218,313 4. 8.9 Il buono,il brutto, il cattivo. (1966) 137,484 5. 8.9 Pulp Fiction (1994)372,926 6. 8.8 Schindler's List (1993) 247,064 7. 8.8 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) 190,056 8. 8.8 12 Angry Men (1957) 100,190 9. 8.8 The Dark Knight (2008) 403,372 10. 8.8 Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)Now, ask yourself the question does ""The Dark Knight"" belong in this list? I do not think it does. My opinion: I do not think that the ""The Dark Knight"" meets the basic criteria of Character Development and story/plot/dialog quality. It is a 2 dimensional action film that wants to nick the surface of character development but fails to meet the challenge.",0
"I'll have to admit, I was not keen on seeing this movie, just because I didn't really enjoy Batman Begins, but I had some hope this movie would be an improvement. And it was... slightly.I did like Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker, besides having no back story or anything like that. Does it deserve an Oscar nod? Not really. I think that's mainly out of the fact that he bit the big one earlier this year. That and he was supposedly going insane while(or because) he was taking on the role, so I guess the acting wasn't much of stretch, then, was it? I have to admit, the direction wasn't very original or spectacular. But besides that, the movie was chalked full of big BANG BOOM action scenes. The scenes that dealt with dialogue seemed to be trying to make up for the lack of action with cheap humor that wasn't all that funny.Rachael Dawes, the most pointless character in the new series... What can I say about her? Other than no one really seemed to care about her or her death. The only reason I feel like she returned for this film was to give Harvey Dent a reason to go nuts and start whacking people.Which brings me to Two-Face... Was it necessary to shove that villain into the last part of the movie like a bad subplot? I think it would've been more appropriate for him to have his own sequel, but I guess the writers really didn't think he deserved that.I also feel like everything in the movie was so forced together. I mean, 3 villains in one movie and none of them hardly interact. I mean, you got Scarecrow briefly cameo-ing his way into the first little bit of the movie. I don't mean to compare the movie to Burton's works because that's biased(and screw you, because I am) but Batman Returns had all 3 of it's bad guys smoothly fit together in the film... was it really that hard? The last thing I really did not like in the movie was Christian Bale's ""I-Must-Sound- Like-I'm-an-80-year-old -woman-who-has-cancer- and-still-smokes-after-60- something-years"" voice.Other than those things, the movie was okay. Does it deserve a 9.7? To be above the likes of Pulp Fiction, Alien, Aliens, Psycho, Grindhouse, etc? Not really. I think the movie has lost itself in the hype and most of the people who gave it a 10 did so because they didn't understand half the movie, but thought it looked cool. I think the movie would sit nice with a 6 or 7.something rating, but that's my opinion.Anyway, I will be not be seeing any more films in this version of the series, so you won't hear from me about it again.",0
I've never been into Superheroes or comics but since this movie got praised to the heavens I watched it. And it blew. The story is simply the joker trying to spread chaos over Gotham City (obviously Chicago) because he is mad (there is also the Mafia and stuff but I found myself not caring at all in a matter of minutes so i will leave it out of this review). Batman tries to stop him being supported by Harvey Dent and Comissioner Gordon (in the beginning Lieutenant Gordon). I will now list the pros and cons: Pro: - Batman looks cool in his costume - The Gotham City Impositors are in the movie - The Joker is well actedCons: - Batmans annoying voice Illogical things like the scene with the two ferries and the bomb. One side would surely have blown up the other because they didn't know if Batman could save them. Or the scene were Joker falls from a building and Batman saves him. Why? He could have just walked away instead of saving this mentally insane guy who just tried to spread chaos all over the city. - The Police in this movie. They are just stupid and incapable of doing their job right. They had several chances to shoot the Joker. For example the oh so beloved chase scene where the joker fires rockets at them. He is in plain view about 10 meters away and the S.W.A.T. guys don't even consider opening the door and shooting him. Or the scene where the old Comissioner is killed. If someone is a possible target for an assassination the police should check every corner of all his casual whereabouts Dent is convinced to be evil and mad in a matter of seconds Batman gets not enough screen time. They could have just named it Joker and Harvey Dent and some others but barely Batman: the Movie - The moral at the end is just naive. Everybody would choose to blow up someone else in order to survive. It isn't ethical at all to choose that you rather like to be blown up it's just pathetic. Because if both sides choose to not blow the other side up they both die. - The characters are bland and barely likable. Batman gets to little screen time to build up a real personality. The Joker is just the Joker but in this film without any real goal but to destroy anything. And the others are just bland.As you can clearly see I personally don't like this movie and I think it totally not deserves to be Nr.7 in the list of the greatest movies of all time.,0
"I watched the movie twice to see if my first reaction to the film is correct. The second watch confirmed it! It was awful. Christian Bale performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman was so cardboard. I'm a big Batman fan and what Christian Bale did to the character was a crime. The voice of Batman was just the beginning of the end for me. Here we are, we have the one of the worlds most greatest Detective and he couldn't figure out anything the Joker's hair brain schemes. Everyone died around this man. He saved no one! At least Michael Keaton's Batman gave Joker a run for his money(Joker:He stole my balloons!). But in this film, he made Batman completely incompetent.This movie should have been called the Joker's revenge, Because it was all about Heath Ledger in this movie. Heath Ledger did a great job. But it seems Christopher Nolan was so into his performance, he forgot about the rest of the cast.Fight scenes were laughable! anyone really in a suit like that and decided to fight crime would get they ass handed to them. Take notes from Blade!!!!!! Speaking of annoying casting, Maggie Gyllenhal was the most painful to watch. Her voice just pierced my soul like a piece of hot coal. Her trying to be sexy! LOL LOL LOL LOL! sorry i'm back! The Movie dragged! especially the last hour and a half of the film. Don't want to spoil anything, but the boat scene was drastically drawn & boring! The best part of the film was when it ended. I have no desire to see this film again.The bad part about this is I found others who felt the same way but so afraid to speak against this film like its the Holy Grail! Give me a break! So many better Superhero films. Spiderman 1 & 2, Blade 1 & 2 Xmen 2 Ironman Punisher Warzone & Incredible Hulk! was more true to the characters.",0
"Great all these idiots out there with their positive reviews are encouraging studios to make more super hero films. This film didn't even make sense. How did the joker mastermind so many 911 type explosive terrorist incidents? Boiled down, this is just another brain dead action flick. If you like stunts, hostage scenes and actors who take themselves a bit too seriously (not a poke at Ledger, just everyone else) then by all means see this film. I mean if there are heaps of ten year olds who thought this film was good and you do too, well, do you think there's something wrong with you?Well buddy if you do really like this film there is something wrong with you. Ultra secret cave-dwelling caped crusaders don't exist OK. You need to move on. Swallow your pride and move on.",0
"Okay. Heath Ledger was worth it. He has created a classic screen villain with his Joker and he deserved his (posthumous) Oscar. The rest of it? Whaaaa... Batman seems to be another classic film franchise that now takes itself seriously. James Bond has become a serious guy and the movies no longer are fun. Same here. Remember both the old Batman TV series and the early movies with their WHAM POW graphics and their delightfully camp dialogue? (Holy hockey pucks, Batman....) (Come to think of it, where was Robin in this Batman outing? Probably auditioning for Hamlet.) Chicago just doesn't make it as Gotham City which used to have such a dark, surrealistic quality. And I had trouble sorting out the good guys and the bad guys. There are no white hats and black hats here. They're all varying shades of grey. Even Batman is a bad guy. Or is he? The effects are good but no better than what the computer now has made routine. Really. They have to do better than blowing up everything in sight and rolling police cars like yo-yo's. Been there, done that! I won a voucher for a free movie in a scratch and win promotion. It was due to expire yesterday so I thought I'd pick up a movie I wanted to see. I had read all the rave reviews about this one and about its various awards. Even the IMDb rating is a rare 9. Gotta be a great evening. Uh uh. At least it didn't cost me anything other than a couple of confused hours.",0
"I didn't enjoy the whole movie and the parts I did enjoy still didn't make up for this letdown. Plot: Nothing new. Seen it all before. Bruce Wayne fights the bad guys in Gotham City while disguised as the batman. Boring. Of course the police chief, the mayor, the district attorney and some rich guys are all there as usual doing the same old thing - politic'n. Boring. The fight scenes: unrealistic. Bruce's punches are too slow for a fist fight let alone that the bad guys had guns and in real life would have easily shot Bruce many times. If they thought bringing in fine actors such as Michael Caine (Alfred) and Morgan Freeman (Lucias Fox, the ""gadget specialist"") would help, it didn't. They could have cast anyone as those characters and it wouldn't have mattered overall. Parts I enjoyed: Heath Ledger as the Joker was a whole other story in itself. Mr. Ledger owned that performance and to me stole the show. All of the scenes were filmed with amazing quality and skill. To bad the storyline was boring.",0
"Overall, this Batman was merely an average movie. It was a mix of greatness and disappointment.What pulled it up was individual performances; particularly by Ledger. But also Oldman, Caine and Gyllenhaal were good.What pulled it down was the non-focused plot and the poorly executed transfigured character of Eckhart.Plot first: The Dark Knight is only a half-baked story about Batman. In fact, it's more about the Joker, the DA and the cop with Batman playing second violin. I could not identify or feel Batman's purpose in the Knight. It's like all the air went out of him since Batman Begins, which I think is a much better movie than Knight.Also Bale was not as good as he was in Batman Begins. Reason being that his the story surrounding his character was not well thought through. It's almost like they tried to stitch in his Batman character after they wrote the main story about the psycho Joker's mission to ""get the Batman"" and to turn good people into bad people.Well, the plot to ""get the Batman"" is simply to make Batman feel so guilty about all the carnage in Gotham that he decides to step down. ABC terrorism tactics. How novel. Please folks. They could have done so much better with the story line.The second mission, to turn good people into bad people, I mean, OK but why is the Joker doing this? There's a disconnect here. The story is not built up. There's no context. Only little is told about the Joker's apparently traumatic past.Now Eckhart: Eckhart's transition from DA to vigilante was so not convincing. I never felt a real love connection between him and Gyllenhaal. There was no spark between the two on screen. They were like oil and water and the storyline never supported Eckhart's apparently insanely deep love for Gyllenhaal. Secondly, Eckhart simply sucked at playing a mean psycho character. He's too cute and lovable for such a role.The flipping of the coin thingy was downright lame. Particularly when one compares to the identical ""method"" of deciding another persons fate as masterfully executed by Bardem in No Country For Old Men.The makeup of the burnt side of Eckhart's face was also poorly done; like it was done in 1980.I also could not identify with Batman's mission in this movie. I had no trouble in Batman Begins, which in my opinion is much better than the Dark Knight.In summary, the Knight lacks story line and context. Ledger is great, but halfway through the movie his character grows old. The movie relies too much on the Joker to carry the story line. The main plots to ""get the Batman"" and turn people bad are both lame and lack story build up to be convincing.",0
"Just came back from seeing this movie. For an action flick it's OK I suppose. Good acting, great special effects. Story is... well as one would expect from a Batman movie. Okayish with a fair amount of cheesiness and very shallow at times.There's nothing really in the story which makes you strain the thing between your ears. Just sit back and be ""wowed"" by all the bright and wonderful special effects and horrible villains.That's all fine by me and pretty much what I would expect from a Batman movie. What I honestly don't understand how this movie made it to #3 in the IMDb. Seems very out of place. In my mind, it shouldn't even make the top 100.",0
"I'm all for action, I like action movies, I really do. Honest. Big explosions, car chases, fist fights, spectacular stunts, all good.But this is just taking the p**s! This is 10 minutes of plot stretched to 2 hours 32 minutes!! 2 HOURS 32 MINUTES!! One seemingly endless action sequence followed by another with a plot which could easily (and has been) be fitted in a comic book. I found I was looking at my watch more than the screen, and thats not good.And as for Heath Ledger's performance, is it pork? Is it bacon? No, its just plain old HAM! Sorry he is dead and all but really, please, any talk of an Oscar is just silly.",0
"I love Batman. In fact I loved Batman begins as much as I did the 1989 Micheal Keaton one. But This one I believe has sold out. It was obvious they're trying to tap into the 'saw' audience by making the joker some kind of ultra realistic disgusting serial killer. Nicholson's performance was so superior it's not even funny. The heath ledger joker had no class whatsoever and was a completely unbelievable bullshit philosopher through out. WHy did he have a knife? Where was the long-ass gun joker's always supposed to have? Very 'saw'-like ""games"" that he played on the masses were a disappointment. The problem is also that the movie tries desperately to tie in ultra-gritty realism and philosophical justifications. It's a comic book for god's sake. Don;t try so hard to make it realistic. It was created with a lot of skill but just took the wrong turn from what I was hoping for. All the situations where just contrived reincarnations of other scenes we've seen in other recent blockbusters. The hostage scenes: 16 blocks-inside man-other stupid cop movies. THe played out ""you have to chose the girl or some other chump"" just like in the spider man movie!Bat man begins was steady and a very creative new take on the comic. They should of focused the originality instead of making an overly-dramatic pile of feces.And two-face? one of my favorite villains. Seemed like they just pulled that one out of their ass and made him into a totally unpredictable dick that got added on towards the end of the movie and then killed off without ever doing anything remotely cool.the cell phone sonar thing was inane.so much potential, wasted",0
"***This comment DEFINITELY contains spoilers. :-)***Okay, let's get the good stuff out of the way, because it won't take long. The acting is good, and the movie is probably worth seeing just for the Heath Ledger role. Most of the rest of the cast does a fine job as well, with the exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal who was pretty flat and lifeless.And the rest of the movie...bad. I'll try to stick with the high...er, lowlights.Action: the chase scenes and most of the action scenes in general were chaotic to the point that you couldn't really follow them. ""Somebody shot something at someone, but someone else maybe interfered somehow so the outcome is unclear and can prolong the scene but we're not sure how or why. But stuff blew up, so it must be cool!"" The biggest issue is plausibility: apparently the Joker (who doesn't make a single joke, BTW) can roll 1000's of 55 gallon drums of gunpowder and/or gasoline all of the city, including the police station and hospitals without anyone noticing.Per Rachael Dawes, ""The safest place is Bruce Wayne's penthouse."" Apparently, she has short term memory issues, because the Joker and crew just waltzed in there the day before. That's right, he can walk thru any security perimeter without the slightest issue. We are not given any reason why this is so or justification for it, he simply appears whenever and wherever the script calls for him no matter how ridiculous. Oh, did I mention he's invulnerable? That's right, he can blow stuff up so that everyone around him is dead or unconscious but there's not a scratch on him.Also, every boat captain carrying a prison population would take a popular vote with the convicts as to what to do with a detonator, right? This is just scratching the surface of issues with this movie, but hopefully it gets the point across. There are lots of other timing/continuity flaws, character inconsistencies, etc. to keep you entertained as well.It is generally against my policy to skew my vote to try and push a rating, but this movie doesn't belong in the top 100, let alone number one all time. I give it about 5/10.",0
"Shooting, killing, shooting more killing some effect by batman doing his stuff. the Characters in the movie does not grow like at batman begin which was awesome, every thing looks the same boring junk movie, no surprises I really don't understand how this movie got this high review score. Nothing exceptional, nothing interesting nothing funny, nothing spacial, just a really boring movie. HAfte 1.5 hours we decided to leave the theater, which actually happened to me only once before. This movie sucks big time. Do not waste your money and your time. If you are a movie maker and you don't have new ideas for sequels please do not waste money, and our time on stupid movies.I rarely go out of movies in the middle, this really really don't happen to me - and I did saw all the fantasy/ Batman,Spiderman, Action Heroes movies ...",0
"A long time ago there was this movie, The Cook, The Thief, The Wife and Her Lover by Peter Greenaway which made itself a painfully obvious 'arty' movie i.e. you'd be a pariah to 'not get it' and worse, not like it.The Dark Knight suffers the same malady. Bloated with self-important preachings of 'we get the superhero we need', 'you either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain' and 'unstoppable force meets immovable object' yadayada. It dares anyone to NOT like it. NOT be kind to Heath Ledger in his final role.Oh please. Gimme the layers of Batman Returns any day. It was dark, deep and even had its tongue firmly in the cheek...Batman: 'What do you want? Penguin: Ahh, the direct approach from a man who hides behind a mask' Dark Knight is big with loud bangs and at best ONE character we can root for.Christian Bale, a good Batman, barely engages in the two and half hours.Gyllenhaal is wasted. As is Freeman.Eckhart's slide...too quick and convenient.And Ledger...like I said, how can anyone DARE say a dead man did a bad job? The only person who does his role great justice is Oldman. He is the only person you look forward to seeing on the screen. The rest...well...I'm sure the comic book fans will prop up Dark Knight's ratings but I'm hoping true blue movie buffs can set the record straight.",0
"Overrated as heck, boring, Heath ledger is ok at best",0
"Wow. Can't believe how high the rating is for this film on IMDb. Did we all see the SAME film?? Wow.Okay, just got back from seeing this, and I gotta say, I was very, very disappointed. Overall, the movie had its moments, but maaaan oh maaaan, was this movie WAY TOO LONG. And unnecessarily so. So far, Christian Bale has proved to be a satisfying Batman, but NO ONE has lived up to my vision of what Batman should truly be up on the big screen. That said, let's move on.THE VIEWING EXPERIENCE: The WORSE PART about this movie for me was the editing. It was unforgivably choppy. Too many scenes ended too abruptly and I guess a whole lot of stuff happened off camera because there were a considerable amount of ""GAPING PLOT HOLES"". THE ACTION: Very intense from the beginning which was great, but the movie peetered out toward the end. That whole scene with Harvey Dent holding Gordon's family hostage was just way too long and too over the top. Dent's transformation into evil happened too quickly, which made his descent into ""Bat-Villain"" unconvincing. It was like he was having a very bad tantrum, that's all. He needed to be spanked or hugged. Nope. Despite what you may read, there wasn't ANYTHING poetic about it. Sorry, Freudians. COOLEST SCENES: I really liked the confrontation scene at the jail between Batman and The Joker. Great, great stuff. Batman was extremely close to ""losin' it"" and I thought for a second he just may kill him, he just might snap and do it. But nah. Batman isn't nearly as amoral as ol' Clown Face. Another scene I liked was when Batman was in Hong Kong kickin' some baddies asses, then he grabs the head honcho Asian dude(can't remember his name, sorry), launches some balloon thingy in the sky, hooks himself and the baddie to an oncoming plane (which of course was all arranged...I wonder who was flying the thing? Lucius?) which takes off into the night sky. That scene was TIGHT. Executed brilliantly. MOST MEMORABLE SCENES: The Joker making that pencil ""disappear."" The Joker walking away in a nurse's uniform as bombs go off behind him. Classic. Those images will stay with me for a long, long time.COOLEST TOY: The Batpod. Geeks will cheer.PERFORMANCES: Heath Ledger was good, yes. Did he give me chills and simply blow me away? Sadly, no. But perhaps I was expecting WAY TOO MUCH. After all, the buzz on his performance as The Joker started way back in January. Does he deserve a posthumous Oscar? No. An Oscar nomination should more than suffice for the ""kudos"" he's been getting. His death is what has swayed, or rather, ""manipulated"" people to say this is the most incredible performance ever seen on screen. Don't be so gullible. It's a good performance, don't get me wrong. But it's not history making. However, Heath now makes Nicholson's Joker look as campy and as ridiculous as Cesar Romero. Christian Bale had his moments; so did Aaron Eckhart. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine will always be veterans of their craft. Everyone else could have phoned it in.THE MUSIC: Not memorable. And in some scenes, shrill and annoying. Where or WHERE is Danny Elfman? WHAT BUGGED ME THE MOST: Batman's gravelly, and super LOUD voice. It sounded completely ridiculous and over-amplified. Not menacing. Just ridiculous. I thought the script tried too hard to send a message. What we got was sophomoric rhetoric which was overly ""preachy"".THE ENDING: A dud. Even though the movie was an agonizing 2.5 hours, I still felt something was missing. Batman being ""hunted down"" by Gordon and the GCPD was lame. The Nolan brothers should've written a much more satisfying ending. I felt cheated. There was not enough of a satisfying denouement for The Joker. He was just left hanging there upside down, giggling like a school girl on crack. They should've given The Joker a much more satisfying final scene. Like that last shot of Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"", staring chillingly into the camera. Joker's exit should have been just as memorable and just as SCARY. What they gave us was WEAK. Pure and simple. And that really, really SUCKS since it was indeed Heath's final scene. His final image up on the big screen doing what he loved the most. They could've given him a better tribute than that. WHAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN: The Joker being FUNNY. Come on, people! That's what The Joker has ALWAYS been about. Not campy, but funny. Heath's interpretation of The Joker was nothing like in the comics. I understand the Nolan brothers wanting to be dark and all that, but let's get real and stick to story origins, okay? The Joker is a demented psychopath yes, but he's also supposed to be wickedly funny. You know, laughing at his own sick twisted humor. We got NONE OF THAT from Heath's portrayal. What he played was a character who should've been named The Sicko. Or The Money Burner. Or Chaos Man. In any case, the Nolan brothers, to me, failed to give us The Joker we all really wanted to see. Again, I liked Heath's performance. I did. But there was still so much missing. OVERALL REVIEW: I was entertained by this film, but was sadly disappointed with the pacing, the editing and some of the gaping plot holes. And what sucks is that I'm a HUGE Batman fan. HUGE!!! I SOOOO wanted this film to be a masterpiece, but it wasn't. Not by a longshot.I actually gave this movie a 6 out of 10 stars, but most of you made this movie's rating on IMDb just unforgivably TOO HIGH.",0
Started to watch on flight to Asia. After 15 minutes went back to listening to music. Just a bunch of cartoon characters in tons of makeup shooting each other. Why did the movie open with two guys sliding down a tight rope stretched from one high rise to another. If they could have rigged the tight rope in the first place why did they need the tight rope to get to their destination? How did the get-away school bus get inside the bank in the first place? Does a procession of school buses always go by that bank at the same time everyday? And what's with all the amazement of Heath Ledger's acting? With all makeup and gee whiz camera angles anyone who liked this movie would be amazed at anyone who played the Joker. At least I didn't have to pay to find out what a disappointment this was.,0
"Dark Knight.If anything good came of this, the movie prompted me to get off my keester and sign up at IMDb, if only at the outrage (OK, maybe disbelief) that this movie is rated 9.1 and currently the 3rd highest ranked movie in IMDb history.Long time reader and user but non-contributor here, now needing to get this off my chest.Even if you go into this movie with the low expectations that need to go with comic book movies, this one stretches far fetched to new limits.The acting, aside from the performance offered by Ledger, was given a terrible screenplay and it showed, and at time makes you want to look away. Bale is horrible as Batman, a hoarse menacing voice accompanied by an overacting mouth, made we wish for Michael Keaton again.I could go on, but I won't. To say that this movie is better than Schindler's List, La Dolce Vita, It's a Wonderful Life, and about 100 other movies that are great to OK, makes me lose just a little faith in our internet institutions.",0
"This movie is not as good as everyone says it to be, so please don't listen to the hype. Now don't get me wrong, the movie is not good but Heath Ledger is. He is the only reason that this movie is rated so high. His acting as the crazy madman that we all grew up to is the probably the only reason i stayed in the movie theater. There is no plot in this movie, and the technology they use defies logic. I believe that if Ledger didn't die that this movie would be rated much lower because 150,000,000 wouldn't have saw it to pay their last respects. I give this movie a 4 out of 10, but I give the Joker 10 out of 10 and definitely and Oscar Nomination.",0
"This movie was a complete turn around from Movie 1. Movie 1 has darkness, grace and sense of awe. The second movie was choppily edited, bad continuity errors such as bike driving into mall scene where it approaches window to smash through then cuts to scene where it hasn't even got near glass. Im thinking who edited this! The worst thing of all was the choice of daylight scenes all the time as opposed to the dark look of the first movie. Gotham might as well be Chicago, we saw no CGI strange skyscrapers and no monorail system. It looked too normal and helicopter shots of buildings looking sunny. Wheres the dirty gritty feel? No new weapons, no secret weapons that could kill everyone. The main character just uses standard guns, rockets and TNT, oh yes and some dogs. Wow. Real imagination being used here, not! No flashback scenes to show Batman in training years, no references to his youth and wrestling with his past... no references to the Jokers past or flashbacks to how he became who he really is now with his cut mouth. All just skipped past.I was left thinking Mr Nolan, is this really you directing this. It could easily looked like any other movie out there.I did enjoy the movie but its a pale 5 out of 10 compared to the first movie. A lot of catching up to do in the next one. Its a bit like the matrix, how do you top it. Well at least you try... not relax and start to get lazy.",0
"This movie must skew toward males, as I thought it really lacked heart and a decent plot line. Maybe when men go to the movies, they don't care as much for a carefully crafted story line. Perhaps it's adrenaline that makes guys go to the movies. This movie did have that. In particular, the chase scenes in the tunnel were quite exciting, but to me, action is not enough to carry a film.I didn't find it emotionally engaging at all, except for the curiosity factor of seeing Heath, who did a great job. Christian Bale, in my mind, was out of his element in this movie. I don't really view him as any sort of an action hero. Spiderman gets my vote over this media-hyped disappointment. At least you're dealing with well-developed characters, some emotional depth, and the dissection of moral issues.I blew $25 dollars at the theater with this, which would have been a month of Netflix. Now I know why I stay home most of the time to view films. I watch at least a movie a day, and this was a waste of an afternoon.",0
"What is this? I can't explain all the enthusiasm for this movie as anything else than necrophilia. Let people die and suddenly everything they do is great. And indeed, Heath Ledger is great in this film. But he's the only one. And lucky for him he's good. Because he has done his share of bad acting in the past. Though I must say he was improving quickly in recent years. I loved him in the Bob Dylan-movie. I hated him in 'Brokeback Mountain'. His performance was too much of a performance there, a number of tics and tricks. Christian Bale is awful here. He looks, acts and walks in and through this movie as if he's the same character from 'American Psycho'. His character is a sleazy bastard, who thinks his money and his own vision is enough to save the world. The arrogance of the character is highly disturbing. And what is the character of Maggie Gyllenhaal doing in this movie. She's a silly women running after the wrong men and paying her life because of her bad taste in men. And are we supposed to cheer for Harvey Dent until he shows his true face? What an asshole. Is this one of these disastermovies which want to warn us for the disastrous future we're heading to? It's so sad to see all these positive reactions. Who are you people? Don't you see the aggression? And are you that silly to accept all the lack of logic. On the one hand this film want to be realistic and dark, over the top dark yes, but still... But then on the other hand it forgets all logic and reality whenever the screenwriters feel they have no logic explanation to give. How some characters suddenly survive when everything is burning and exploding, I don't know. And the whole movie we're after the Joker, but when they finally get hold of him, we don't get to know what is happening with him. I am a huge fan of 'Memento' and I also thought 'Insomnia' was a great and clever full. But as clever as the former films of Nolan were, as stupid is this one.",0
"I think this movie deserves 7 stars, but I give it 1 star because I don't think this movie should be so high in the top 250 IMDb list.I liked the performance of Heath Ledger as The joker. That is why I think many people gave to ""The Dark Knight"" 10 stars, and of course besides the great marketing that this movie had. I didn't like the voice that Christian Bale used when he was dressed like batman, he sounded so rare. I think Heath Ledger is going to be nominated for the Oscar awards for his performance as the joker in the supporting actor category.In short, this is a good movie, but an overrated movie.",0
"This is easily the worst superhero movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale, with his lisping American accent is the worst Batman to have ever worn the costume and the digitizing of his voice only serves to make him appear more ridiculous. This movie will bludgeon your senses in its desperation to entertain - it is very, very loud and there is enough broken metal and glass to start a recycling plant. The plot is so fast and frenetic that it rarely makes any sense, and just when it begins to, it is immediately off in another direction. Plot threads start and stop every three minutes it seems. Aaron Eckhart is a fine actor, but whose idea was it that he should walk around in the last thirty minutes with half of his face burned off. Perhaps somebody should explain to the writers that burn patients who walk around exposed like that are highly prone to infection and don't live long. Yet this guy parades around like it's just another day in the park with half his face missing and no bandages. It was as grotesque and gratuitous as it was silly. I guess it's what you do when your movie doesn't have much to say. The movie has an impressive lineup of movie stars - standouts are Eckhart, Oldman, Caine and Roberts. They are all very good but none is good enough to save this misfire. And then there's Morgan Freeman. Is there any movie made these days that doesn't have Morgan Freeman in it? He is so overexposed that he has become a bit of a joke. He is also in one of the most ridiculous scenes in the film where he stands befuddled in front of a bunch of TV monitors. This is another one of many scenes filmed with high energy and no sense at all. As if all of this wasn't bad enough, this thing lumbers on for two and a half very long hours. Aren't we all a little tired of the superhero who is 'conflicted'? When I hear people talking about academy awards for this film, it is a reminder to me of how the industry equates bigger with better. If you want bigger, this might be your film. If you want better, look elsewhere.",0
"One of the WORST films I've forced myself to sit through.Nothing happens, except explosions and violence.Skip it. And Heath Ledger's Oscar win was solely for the fact he had died.Basically, I think America had become the only country in the world where a movie like this could be popular. A movie about a SUPERHERO (!) who wants to clean a fictional metro city up?Morgan Freeman, Micheal Caine, anymore Oscar winners looking for money?And the screen time of this was atrocious. I seriously thought the movie was NEVER going to end.",0
"Watching The Dark Night was torture for me, maybe after Batman and Robin, these Nolan movies are the WORST of all. I mean: 1. could you understand any word of the ridiculously deep and unnatural voice of Bale as Batman, I thought he was ill from throat cancer or something, and 2. what was that Gotham City (New York) in broad daylight all the time - it's Batman movie not Sun hero movie, and 3. was there any plot about the Joker and his motives - I don't think so, and 4. who would like this ugly NOT aerodynamical batmobile with tires placed in front of the car, OK I actually liked the bike but the batmobile was ugly and ... ugly, and 5. Harvey Dent - the villain (good guy or whatever he is) who was completely out of character, remember Batman Forever - there Harvey The Two Face was a well made villain played by great actor, and 6. the ridiculous batsmartphone device which makes Batman to see everyone in the city what he or she was doing, and 7. what kind of Batman (city ""Guardian"") is that, who doesn't care about wrecking millions of dollars in people's personal damages (damaging and blowing random city cars and a lot of other stuff), and 8. at the end of the Dark Night why they did not they blame the Joker for all the crimes, he was killing people and blowing buildings up the whole movie, and 9. this was supposed to be Batman movie (Fantasy Adventure Action), not ridiculous realistic Crime looking hero movie, the bright modern looking atmosphere of this flick more suits to The Departed, The Godfather, LA Confidential and so on, it's Batman movie it's not supposed to be realistic, ...... Bottom line: awful movie !!!",0
"This is an intelligent well written movie with some great performances but it is not a Batman movie. Apart from getting a fingerprint from a bullet there is no detective work. There is no use of batarang (throwing stars etc.) Batman doesn't fire his cable thingy and swing from any buildings. In fact he doesn't use any items from his utility belt. Another major flaw with this movie is the absurd use of every mobile phone in Gotham as a sonar, which Batman uses to track the Joker. This sci-fi technology is out of place in this movie, mobile phones don't have receivers in them capable of coming close to this level of wizardry. A true batman would of used his detective skills to find the Joker. The Joker only makes one joke in the whole move, albeit very funny (disappearing pencil). It's OK to reinvent characters but there should be some consistency and I think jokes are for the Joker.",0
"I saw this movie twice and both viewings have not changed my initial thought. Grossly over-hyped, a lot of muddled dialog (particularly when the Dark Knight speaks) and some really silly and unacceptable plot holes. What I won't do is detail these holes because they've been mentioned and opinionated on hundreds of times already. Well, one, and only one: The Jokers recurring speeches about how he is an agent of chaos and he's not a man who plans, he just does things. Ring,ring,bells,buzzers and a red flag for ya'--Every single scenario and setup in this film would have to involve major planning and tremendous attention to detail to pull it off, ie: rigging explosives in hospitals, on ferries, and in a precinct--all of these places are public domains-- surgically implanting cellphones, penthouse home invasions full of politicos, dignitaries and all their accompanying security people. Point made? This paragraph will be for the true film aficionados. Can we agree that in order for a movie to be bestowed with accolades like (the following terms, with the exception of genius or awesome can never truly apply to something artistic or creative in nature) best ever, the greatest, genius, the most misused and overused word in these times--awesome--, and many other pretentious terms it has to hold up to scrutiny when all the hype has left town? For those who have a good reference point for films regardless of genre, budget or era in which a film was made, I can't see how they won't see this film as anything more than fairly entertaining, unremarkable and pretty forgettable.One other thing-- and this may really appeal to all my hardcore film people out there. Something struck me as interesting the other day. Get a hold of a copy of the Exorcist III if you can (if your a real film beast you might make this connection just from memory) and when you get to the scenes where Brad Dourif is in his cell talking with G. C. Scott pay attention to his speech patterns and his mannerisms. Its almost like Mr. Ledger subconsciously or even overtly brought Dourif's performance into his portrayal as the Joker--which I found to be energetic but far from 'genious', 'groundbreaking', 'instant classic','awesome'and the many other bru-hahas coming out of so many pie holes.I'm saying all that to say this, Ledger may not have been influenced by Dourif's portrayal of Damien Karras but it illustrates that hardly nothing is new or groundbreaking and rarely is something totally different in modern cinema.For those interested, post up on IMDb if you view that segment in Exorcist III and can juxtapose it to TDK's Joker portrayal. You guys tell me if something seems soooo... familiar or not.3 out of 10 from the non-sheep / non-fanboy set.--I just had a thought fart--Should give it 2outta10 for casting that annoying little whinny kid from the Mist (Gordon's boy).",0
"First of all, I blame the publicity for the over-hyping of this movie to the point where I expected nothing short of an incredible experience. I heard it compared to ""the Untouchables"" and ""the Godfather""... NO WAY!!! What I actually got was a REALLY long movie with a few good moments, and a truly overly complicated and hard to follow plot. I would honestly say that, other than the scenes with Heath Ledger, this movie was not that great. But I have to say, poor late Heath, what an amazing acting job. What a loss, I am so sad that this was his last movie. Who knew what else he might have accomplished? He made every scene he was in riveting, disturbing, funny and terrifying all at once. Without him, this movie would have been even more disappointing. I guess in a nutshell, that in this summer of crappy movies, this one was less crappy than the rest.",0
"I don't know if this is the most overrated film ever, but it's the worst one I've seen in a long, long time. Almost as long as this steaming waste of three hours of my life. Let's review: * Suspension of disbelief is part and parcel of the superhero world, but c'mon. You're telling me this psychopath has recruited dozens of henchman, purchased mountains of equipment and rigged several hundred barrels of explosives in locations all over the city, and the world's greatest detective can't find a SINGLE BLEEDING CLUE without some Mr. Wizard cell phone stunt? Yeah, sure, half the cops are on the take, but are all of them blind, in this post-9/11 world? The Joker's band is comprised of escapees from an asylum, but they're all lean, mean, disciplined and competent? * This may be the widest ratio of screen time:plotfree of the decade. Too many characters. Too many side scenes. Too many random encounters. Too much exposition that doesn't actually expose anything. What do we leave this movie knowing? Anything? * The sheer quality was poor. Much of the film was too dark to see, and the sound was terribly spotty, yoyoing between blaringly loud and inaudible.* Yeah, Ledger did a good job, so stipulated. He still wouldn't have cadged an Oscar for it without the posthumous sympathy vote.* Finally ... this just blew a hole through the genre. Aren't the good guys supposed to WIN? They spend the movie losing ... dozens of people getting murdered, hundreds wounded and terrorized, chaos, mayhem, death and destruction and violence, and they pretty much lose at the end too. There's very little hopeful or uplifting here.2/10, barely.",0
"How this movie can be at the top of the IMDb all-time-greatest-movies is beyond me. So unbelievable, so many substories that go nowhere, such terrible acting....I really tried to like it, but during watching I got more and more amazed by all the faults in the story. And then there's this absurd voice of batman. And then there's the joker, who is not scary or freaky at all. And the storyline has several faults and events are unbelievable.",0
"No one else I've ever talked to in person about this movie has disliked it. All my friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, random strangers on the street that I pass by... they all LOVED it. Not liked it a lot, or thoroughly enjoyed it.. they LOVED it. And I couldn't stand it. Honestly it made me feel like a bit of an outcast. So it was with great pleasure that I found that even though this movie is on the Top 10 movies on IMDb, there are a plethora of reviews containing exactly the same qualms I had with this film.I registered with IMDb just so I could post this review and lower this movie's rating a tiny bit. (+1 to all the negative sentiments in all the negative reviews of this movie)",0
"This is one of those films teenagers can see and then feel like they've seen a meaningful movie with great action scenes and grown-up themes, a movie that seems to present deep moral philosophies and it has the additional benefit of a cast that has real acting credentials. All in all, I suspect teens will rave about this movie as one of the best of all time.In reality, TDK shows what Christopher Nolan can - and can't - do with a big budget. He wallows in his own zeitgeist, stuck in the quicksand of his creativity and unable to hone & polish a slush fund of ideas and concepts about explosions, car chases, the rantings of a killer called The Joker, and the fortitude of a hero called Batman. The movie drags on and on and on looking for its core, but never finds it. Ultimately, all it finds are the excuses it needs for the special effects.Heath Ledger's performance is outstanding, but then his character is the only one in the film that has much of anything to say and, since he's a caricature, he can ham it up to his heart's desire. Character development is not high on the priority list. The supposed romance between plain-faced boring Rachel and Batman is like a red herring, serving what purpose I could not see. But then, plot development isn't a high priority for this story, either. There is a weak attempt to bring a mob crime boss into the plot as an accomplice to The Joker, and an even weaker sub-plot about moving money to Asia, but all of this is treated so superficially you can see how Nolan just doesn't have the artist's discipline to edit out unnecessary footage. He thinks *everything* he writes and films is important, forgetting that the mature audience is not looking for a ride on his ego trip.TDK has the look of a storyboard or perhaps a comic: blocks of scenes, dialogue, and graphics. It lacks the fluidity of true drama that is paced with suspense and emotional connections between characters. It lacks the wit that is absolutely necessary to make a fantasy entertaining and involving. It is overwrought, overlong, and bloated by its self-importance. But because it's Batman on a big budget and has little competition and critics are starved for something to praise, it will sell.",0
"It is unnerving that this film has received one of the highest rankings I have seen or heard of at IMDb, although I am a part-timer here. My experience has been that even the best films of the last century are generally in the 8.0 - 9.0 range. Anyway, let me go beyond analysis of reviews.I saw the movie last night, and was struck first by how difficult the voices were to hear. My son, who is 19, spontaneously offered the same comment to me. And there were no British accents (that I recall)! It was the loud, ominous music pulsing in the background, and possibly issues in the theater (which appeared to be very well maintained, however), that seemed to obscure the dialogue in many places.Now, the guts of the movie: this film falls into the category of slightly better-than-average kids/fantasy movie. The top in that field was indeed Lord of the Rings (all three), and I also consider Terminator 1 and 2, and the first Matrix, to all exceed The Dark Knight by quite a margin in enjoyability and quality. So, I am not set against fantasy as a category of entertainment or creativity.However, this movie was fragmented with many sub-plots that did not seem artistically to jell well together. There was also a typical lack of subtlety in the actors (and their scripts) that you might expect in comic book fantasy, and during my watching of Dark Knight I constantly missed movies such as (to name just a very few) Dr. Strangelove, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Swept Away, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life, which all exceeded Dark Knight in wit, dialogue, acting, or humor (or all the above).What were the strong points? Well, again, it was not so bad for the genre - the acting was workmanlike given the one-dimensional or unreal dialogue. The Joker (Heath Ledger) really was performed with great intensity and is probably the standout feature the breaks the limits of the rest of the film. The characterizations were far from terrible - touches of humor with Alfred (Michael Caine), the love interest that had some sensitivity and adultiness to it, and again, Joker's performance.When does our public have a chance to see real movies of quality, and learn to distinguish expensive, earnest, but childlike efforts from masterworks of adult art, whether comedy, adventure, or tragedy? Apparently not very often.Despite the noticeable islands of quality in Dark Knight, my sense was that of having been swept away by a wave of excess and hyper-drama, and I came away feeling that there were a wide variety of better ways I could have passed three hours.",0
I'm convinced this is the movie that drove heath ledger insane,0
"One of the writer's wanted it to be realistic? yer kidding..Could the joker realistically rig up all that stuff? ...c'mon, maybe a bomb in a closet, but the character's mayhem seems very unlikely (hospital demolition was particularly overdone). And what a premise, ever been to a hospital? Full of hard working people helping sick and hurting folks, nice theme point to blow one full of innocent people up; Like i said gratuitous vileness, period. And could anyone understand what Batman was saying? So much of his dialog I replayed and even after several times, still couldn't make it out; perhaps all for the best.The movie's set up -(of course to justify the conclusion), - is just all sort of contorted, irksome to this viewer. Another point of 'unbelieveability': when a person experiences really severe injuries, as one character did, how many scenes can you expect to play as a ""running around guy"" when you should actually be hanging by a thread in intensive care? We saw it on cable TV; did he perhaps turn super human during a commercial?Finally: does anyone know what becomes of our friend the Joker in the end? Maybe the TV version cut that out? It just sort of left him ""hanging"".All in all, a pretty crumby premise, w/ what's become so overused and typical: sick motives, expressed by pathological plot themes and characters. Just more of the same sensationalism, like so much of todays action thriller stuff, nothing new here, just another film trying to out ""gross"" (and by that I mean: to be more grotesque, repulsively ugly or distorted and gruesome).For a viewer who enjoys action movies, or used to, from what's being produced now-a-days, - I'm more inclined to pass them by and go for other genres. My recommendation: save your time and seek alternate entertainment to this gut wrenching tripe. I'd say boycott it, and the stuff it imitates. Avoid it like you would trans fat and second hand smoke, it too will probably be found not not so good for us in the long run (exposure to sick minds carrying out sick motives. You can find entertainment alternatives that aren't based on sicko themes!(and also, never try to do one of these reviews on an android, ouch.",0
"Christopher Nolan is a great director. He several great movies under his belt such as: Memento, The Prestige, and Batman Begins. I loved these. And so when that's why I went to see The Dark Knight, I expected something great; I heard people praising it as 'a masterpiece', or 'best movie in 10 years'. So I saw it. Major disappointment.I walked out of the theatre befuddled; ""So that's what the hype was all about?"" Although Ledger completely owns the role of the Joker and he gives a fantastic performance that must be seen, the movie surrounding it is at times mediocre. The pacing, character arcs, direction and impact of the movie are all flawed. The ending was pretty terrible too. Its not a bad movie and I'd give it a 7/10 but I must vote a 1 because of all the fanboys that are blinded by the hype.",0
"Having negative opinions about this film does not constitute ""Trolling"" as defined by Wikipedia. The film was entertaining but was arguably worse than other Batman films from the past. There appeared to be a shift from the Comic book hero being the main protagonist to the ""Joker"" being the main character. The purpose of such a film had more to do with the marketing of the film within the controversy of and blatant exploitation the Actor Heath Ledger's death. This has lead to arguably and debatable claims about Ledger's performance in the film. This is understandable as his fans will not tolerate any negativity with regards his performance. as a result this message board is dominated by those who totally dismiss the great performance of other Batman villains such as Danny De Vito as the Penguin and the list is long. There as has been some very intelligent comments detailing how this film veers from the comic book hero, upon which it is based, to a dark ""Cop"" film. None the less the film is a hit and Ledger fans expect Heath Ledger's role as the ""Joker"" to earn an Oscar and go down as the greatest performance of an actor in the history of Film. I personally believe that Heath Ledger's and Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the Joker a bit too morbid but none the less effective as a villain. Overall the film was contrived and formulated and the script was a bit dodgy as far as story line but so are all Comic Book hero films. I thought Christian Bale's performance as Batman was great but the digitally enhanced voice effect made him seem too dark a Knight. In fact judging by this forum one would think that Batman was now the villain and the ""Joker"" was the great good guy. It was far from being a great film and eventually the hysteria from the more juvenile minds will subside and the film will fade into the esoteric world of the ""Batman"" collector.",0
"I can't tell you how disappointed I am in The Dark Knight. My friends and I waited for months to see this and it was a film I was expecting to see numerous times. Having viewed it, I wouldn't watch it again unless someone paid me a lot of money.I'm a science-fiction fan so I on board with artistic allowance as long as it's consistent with the framework of the film. There were several violations in this movie that I don't understand how people/fans can get past.I'll site a few examples that I feel cheapened the movie beyond repair: 1)Right out of the gate in the opening scene, since when can Batman bend a steel gun barrel with his hands? 2)Bruce Wayne is now smart enough to network all the phones in Gotham City and stick the results into a database? Last time I checked, my phone didn't have sonar technology. The phone that Morgan Freeman brought to Hong Kong was described to have special capabilities. Yet suddenly Bruce Wayne is able to extend that capability to all 30M citizens phones in the city? The most idiotic part was when Mogran Freeman was analyzing the output and suddenly the Jokers face appeared on the screen immediately in front of him. Did the Joker stop by AT&T before that scene to upgrade his phone? There were about 500 mini-screens in front of Moran Freeman and he just so happened to be looking at the one where the Jokers face appeared. I wanted to leave the theater at this point.3) If you are admitted to the hospital with burns on half your body and your clothes are saturated from lying on a floor with gasoline, the hospital will remove and dispose of your clothes when you are admitted. Yet when the Joker freed Two-Face, Two Face suddenly had his half-burned clothes back on for the remainder of the movie.4)Who planted all the explosive charges in the hospital for the joker? There seemed to be hundreds of devices that were suddenly in place (and conveniently no hospital staff noticed). Oh, and how convenient that the Joker had a friend or a bomb in the right place at the right time whenever he was in a bad position. Something like this is okay in couple occasions in the movie, but not in every scene.5)What was the point in having the Lamborghini in the movie just to be destroyed. Cheap thrill.Ledgers direct performance was great. I just wish they had built a simpler more believable movie around him. I wanted this movie to be great as much as anyone here. I expect a certain level of consistency and believability from the movies I watch. Again believable within the framework of the movie. As much as I wanted TDK to be a great movie, I couldn't even will this movie to the level of awful.",0
"I'm downrating this movie strongly in response to the unbelievable amount of positive hype it's gotten (objectively I'd rate it a 4). I'm usually easy to please with movies; I loved Batman Returns. But ""Dark Knight"" was badly screwed up, IMO. What a pity. Pros: the acting was excellent (Ledger gives an all-out performance), and the visuals were great. Cons: some people have described this as a horror movie. But it's a horror movie without a good plot, without heroes, and without any emotionally satisfying defeat of the horror. Plot's a mess. Script was written by the director and his brother. It feels like the two pontificated and out-clevered themselves into writing a script that 1) tries to crams in *way* too much material and 2) feels awkward, meandering, preachy, and more interested in ideas than in characters or stories. No coherent storyarc; pacing is wrong. About halfway through the movie, there's a big death scene that in any other movie would have been part of the movie climax. But here, it's just another in an ongoing string of disasters. You have no idea where the movie's going after that; it devolves into one threat/action scene after another. Movie goes on far too long (people were muttering thru the last half, in my theater) and then just -- stops. No sense of triumph or closure; just another limp failure. One guy behind me said, ""Well, whatever. I need a beer."" Characterization was screwed. Multiple characters did things that made no sense logically in the story, or for their established personality. Because dialogue depends on decent characterization ? much of the dialogue sucked. The romance elements? Yawn. Interpersonal relationship and conversational insights into characters? Double yawn. The heroes are shown as failures -- flustered, outmaneuvered, emotionally and morally bankrupt. Yeah, I want moral complexity in a superhero movie ? but it also helps if the heroes are sometimes allowed to be, you know, heroes. Overall recommendation: worth seeing for the acting and visuals, but plot and characterization stink.",0
"Well, the praise for this movie must be due to Heath Ledger's death, or at least I hope that's the reason, because the movie is pretty disappointing. Ledger is a convincing maniac, but the rest of the cast falls short. Is Christian Bale in this movie? I think he gets the least screen time of the three leads (Ledger, Eckhart included) and really doesn't get many good lines. The only scenes I enjoyed were between he and Ledger. The editing of this film reflects the Joker's theme - chaos...was that intentional? If so, a poor choice. After the wonderful simplicity of many superhero films, including Batman Begins (I'd give that a 9/10), Dark Knight may have not been edited at all! It seems thrown together with no accounting for the viewer's intelligence. I've seen better episodes of television.",0
"I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. I am shocked it has such positive reviews and raving fans. I give it a 5/10.My biggest complaint is about the overall storyline, which I felt was lacking. There seemed to be a bunch of characters ranging from very interesting (Heath) to not as interesting (Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman felt like non-characters this time around). And then there was a bunch of scenarios, some very tense and cool (the joker pitting the two boats against each other), and some very tired (didn't the hostages wear the masks in INSIDE MAN?). But there wasn't a great throughline to pull me through.In my opinion, a series of miscellaneous scenarios, a villain vs. a hero, and a smattering of people with assorted agendas does not make a solid storyline where from scene to scene I wonder what's going to happen. I got bored at times. It felt like a fantastic premise, but no story.I also don't feel much for Bruce Wayne/Batman character this time around. I haven't seen Batman Begins in awhile, but I'm pretty sure they show us his human side and that his laziness/womanizing/partying is just his Bruce Wayne cover-up. In this movie, he was cold. The kissing scene was ridiculous. He kisses Rachel then strides away with one hand in his pocket like he doesn't give a care at all?which pretty much makes me not care about his character at all either.",0
"I have registered here at IMDb just now, because I continuously fail to see how this movie is no.1 on the top 250 list...I've seen this movie 3 times in order to get a good impression of it and not to miss any parts. So, I have seen quite a few movies myself, and I think this movie was just a bit above average...Thanks to Heath Ledger and partly to Aaron Eckhart...True, I've never seen better performances of the two, but the rest of the movie was just disappointing...Just a few things I'd like to note: Heath ledger was amazing. Though not the best performance in the last decade. Not even close. Just remember Edward Norton in American History X or in Fight Club, or maybe Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York and There will be blood, or Javier Bardem in No country for old men, or Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal, or Russell Crowe in Gladiator and A beautiful mind, or Samuel Jackson in Resurrecting the Champ, Whitaker in Ghost Dog...I swear I could go on and on and on. And that's just the LAST DECADE.Aaron Eckhart was a surprise.Bale was a disappointment. Whoever wants to see the REAL Bale should watch RESCUE DAWN.The best Batman AND superhero movie so far.I was disappointed to see how the Joker never actually told any jokes, nor did he laugh hysterically most of the time, though I do like the portrayal.Nolan was good. Good, not Very good or excellent or perfect. The movie is too much an imitation of HEAT.All in all, the movie was entertaining, though not even close to a masterpiece. This movie in the top 250? B L A S P H E M YCheers everyone, hope you enjoy the movie more than I did.",0
"OK, I've heard enough of people saying this film is the best thing ever, you guys must be madder then the joker. This film was terrible, the only good thing being the way it was shot. The plot is poor, the writing terrible... I wanted it to end half an hour in. Worse yet this film destroys all the cool of the Joker, if shaking your head and laughing lots makes for good acting... I must be some kind of philistine. Comparing this to the original films Joker, you wonder what happened to make the writers feel this was a better image ...At least Morgan Freeman was good in his role as Morgan Freeman. This film was in fact so bad that I have been working to implant the false memory of giraffes into certain scenes, in order to distort and destroy my recollection of this rubbish, and to forget the money I wasted going to see it.",0
"OMG! Heath got depressed because of playing this silly lunatic? Joker is emanation of evil? The dark knight is no4 on IMDb list? Please!This is typical and so average action flick. With really stellar cast... Most of my favorite actors are here (Caine, Bale, Oldman) and some other I usually enjoy watching (Freeman, Eckhart, Gyllenhaal) BUT it was all in vain because - at first place I like movies with message or those that'll make you think (f.e. Figt club, Dogville, American beauty...) And if there's no message or possibility of insight, I like to be entertained (f.e. Noises off, Corpse bride, The Curse of the Black Pearl (even St. Trinian's and Mamma mia!, although shallow and naive, they make you smile, sing/dance) But this one?!? 1. message _ none, this movie won't make you think about your life, won't change your point of view, won't make you a better person, won't even make you think at all; 2. fun _ a lot if you like violence, blowing things up, fire, killing, otherwise none. Too long, boring, shallow... No dialogs, no humor, nothing... Thank God I've waited for DVD, so I could use fast forward... I'll give it 5/10 in my ""notebook"", but just 1 here, because it's waaaay overrated.",0
"Looking over this movie piece by piece, anyone could say it was excellent.The acting was phenomenal. Heath Ledger deserves every accolade that's heaped on him by fans and reviewers alike.The dialogue was sharp, relevant, and paced well.The action was mind-boggling, but not so over-the-top that you were taken out of the story. That is an excellent, and incredibly difficult, balance to achieve.The directing and camera work was outstanding.The music was great.Even the makeup and costuming deserves a nod, especially for the fascinating re-design of the classic ""Joker"" look. And I loved the new batsuit. (Nestor Carbonell was wearing eyeliner--was that a shout-out to LOST fans? :) ) All-in-all, it was a superbly *crafted* piece of art.****But I will never, ever watch it again. Why?***** Well, let's put the shoe on a different foot and see how it fits. What if the story of ""Lord of the Rings"" was told this way? What if, after their long, arduous journey, Sam decides that *he* wants the ring, kills Gollum to get it, then Frodo has to throw Sam into the pit of Mount Doom to destroy the ring...but destroying the ring doesn't really rid Middle Earth of Sauron, and Frodo spends the rest of his (short) life in disgrace, and dies of a broken heart? What would we say after we left the theater? ""Why the hell did I just sit through that movie? What was the point?"" Or what if Harry Potter was told this way? After 7 books and 17 years, what if it ended with Hermione being tortured to death, Ron blaming Harry and becoming a Death-Eater, Harry refusing to kill Voldemort out of respect for all living things, and the entire wizarding world blaming Harry for Hermione's death? What would we say after putting down book 7? ""Why the hell did I just read all those books? What was the point?"" The Dark Knight's over-arching theme was, ""You either die the hero, or live long enough to watch yourself become the villain."" The story that this movie tells is simply this: no matter how hard you try to fight evil, evil will take everything from you, and the world will be no better off for your sacrifice. If you stand against evil, here's what you'll get. Maniacs with no motives, misguided moralists, or simply ""blind chance"" will take the people you love, break your body, destroy your mind, and leave you with nothing in return. And as the Joker unflinchingly tells Batman, insanity is just a little ""push"" away.Oh, great.Does it surprise anyone that Heath Ledger had anxiety attacks and insomnia after immersing himself in this script? The creators of this movie used an immense amount of story-telling talent to create a film that tears hope away from the soul. Why? What's the point? What a waste of time, creativity, and resources! What a waste of a good story! What a waste of spirit!",0
"First things first: there is no expression, ""close to the CHEST"". The accepted expression is ""close to the VEST"". Getting this wrong is small, perhaps, but making up your own expression is just stupid. Nowadays, the difference between getting something right and getting it wrong is ""whatever"" but this is remarkable to me that they simply got it wrong or made up their own expression. Oh, I'm sorry: you can't just make up your own expression.The movie is waaaaaaaaay too long. We hear the same speech like 9 times. And not just one ""same speech"", a same speech from Bruce Wayne, and from Batman, and from Rachel and CERTAINLY from The Joker. And the last 25 minutes is a story-within-the-movie that doesn't need to be there. I couldn't tell what little threads were important and which one's were not. That's a good thing in some movies but not here.After Gordon is dead/not dead, I kept waiting the Rachel Dawes to reappear. Was she really killed or fake killed? OK, again, maybe that's me, but it was a distraction. So is the presence of Anthony Michael Hall; why is he here? He's too familiar, typecast to be in the movie. Again, a distraction.""Oscar buzz for Heath Ledger?"" Are you kidding me? Makeup I did not like, a nervous pulse in his voice (but just for the first half of the movie. In jail, he doesn't have the consistency of that nervousness.) But an Academy Award? For what? HIs death, that's what. This was an interesting performance but that's all. Just interesting. I'm just being critical of an actor whose performance is being overrated.Further, you just know that when Heath died, these guys put in every single scene he filmed. Like pigging out at the buffet, you have to show some control. They did not. The movie is EASILY 25-40 minutes too long. And frankly, the whole ""savior vs. vigilante"" line that the whole movie hinges on is really pretty abstract. Gotham is being destroyed by crime, why split hairs? Batman Begins was clearly, more sharply focused, crisp. This is fat, overwrought, overweight and a waste of a really good cast.Maggie G. is perfectly fine but in her media interviews, she's beginning to take herself a little seriously. Hey! Maggie! You're no Olivier, baby. ""Batman Begins"" used violence as a metaphor; this movie is really just about the violence. Which, I guess, is why everyone likes it so much. This is a mediocre movie, tops. But since I loved Batman Begins, I'll just watch that again.",0
"I saw this movie opening night, a fan of Batman Begins, and eager to see the next installment of a promising franchise. I purposely avoided the ""hype"" prior to watching - I like to watch a movie with as little preconception as possible.After having seen the movie, I am blown away... by the 30-something pages (at present) of cloned reviews stating that The Dark Knight is ""a masterpiece"" ""an instant classic"" ""epic"" ""better than the hype"" ""legendary"" ""oscar-worthy"", etc. It wouldn't bother me so much except all 30 pages of reviews say *exactly* the same contrived things. Not until after you get past these ""glowing"" marketing reviews, do you see 10 pages of real honest reviews buried in the back. The real tragedy is that I used to feel that this website was credible, but now I'm not so sure. A few hundred picture perfect reviews here are worth multiple millions in next weekend's ticket sales. That's an easy decision for a marketing department to make.But back to The Dark Knight and back to reality. Here are just a few of the problems with it: Poor character development. With the possible exception of Harvey's character development (which was too rushed) you don't really feel any sense of growth, change, or evolution of the characters. In each of the many acts in this film, the same conflicts are presented over and over - the characters are stuck in a loop - the main thing that changes are the locations and who gets blown up. In some cases you have no idea what the motivations of the characters are. The Joker is insane, maniacal, twisted... but ultimately with no explanation of why he does what he does. Shocking behavior without a point is... well, pointless.Poor storyline development. There is no beginning middle and end. Nothing is actually resolved (aside from the fate of a few characters); again it's just a series of loosely strung together conflicts that happen over and over again in various iterations during the course of 2.5 hours. The ending is very unsatisfying as there is no sense of resolution.The action/fight sequences are filmed too closely and irritating to watch. The fast movement and the close up shots are indistinguishable and you can't tell what's actually happening. While it's visually stimulating (in an MTV kind of way), it's not very intellectually captivating to watch body parts of one unknown person striking the body parts of another unknown person for minutes at a time (I know this because I had to keep checking my watch).The cinematography was too dark. While this was obviously a choice for establishing the mood for the film, it made the film a strain to watch. The very few scenes shot in brighter light or daylight were a relief to the eyes, but these were few and far between.The above paragraph applies to the theme of the movie... it was so pervasively dark, grim, and depressing, with almost no contrast, it made it very exhausting to watch. I typically enjoy ""dark"" films, but the successful ones manage to infuse variation and interesting counterpoint throughout.For all of these reasons the film is just too long... films can be interesting for 2.5 hours but in light of all the problems above, this film just dragged on and on.The ""social experiment"" reminded me of an assignment you might get in a first semester college psychology class. ""Discuss what people might do if they're in a boat..."" It was just a bit too contrived for me and I found it a bit laughable. The result was even more contrived.Heath Ledger: Great performance but impossible to view the film and not feel the impact of the actor's untimely death as you watch him on-screen. His interpretation was excellent and his actual dialog was well-written, but his character could have been so much more interesting if there were some basis for understanding the origin of his insanity.I really wanted to love this film as much as Batman Begins, but unfortunately I found my interest drifting at times. It was not a bad movie, and there were some great moments as well, but just not the ""masterpiece"" the marketing types want you to believe.",0
"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The dialog was often difficult to hear, especially Batman who, for some unknown reason, seemed to be suffering from Laryngitis. Because of the ""Dark"" nature of the movie it was often far ""too dark"" to see what was happening. All which meant that the plot was far more difficult to follow.Since the days of Adam West, we have seen several different ""Batmen"" not least Val Kilmer and Michael Keaton to name two who were far better at it than Christian Bale. As for Heath Ledger, I thought his character was so over played that he stole the show so to speak but as for awarding him a posthumous Oscar, well thats another matter and I personally don't think so.",0
"This Batman movie is told from the Republican point of view. According to this film, violence is the only possible solution in every situation. Intelligence is of no use. The hero is a rich man, Bruce Wayne, a boor who brags about how much money he has. Republicans will love him. Instead of outwitting his enemies, which might require more gray matter than is contained in his cranium, this Batman just invests in fancy new weapons. This sounds like the policy of the outgoing Administration.The villain, the Joker, is a two dimensional idiot that only wants ""to see the world burn,"" having no depth whatsoever. He kills even those who cooperate with him. He is yet another serial killer, a tedious figure often used in films because the writer has no imagination and no grasp on human psychology. Anytime you see a serial killer in a film, it means the writer is to lazy to bother thinking about motivation.I stopped the movie mid-way through and threw the DVD in the trash can. It was that bad. I liked the previous Batman movies better. They had some heart. This one has no heart and should therefore appeal to a great many armchair generals out there that fantasize about fancy weapons.",0
"No scene in this film lasts for long enough to be able to appreciate the content, whether that be an action sequence, or the potentially-thoughtful dialogue. The end result is jerky, so much so that at times I even had trouble following the plot.This is a key example of how average scene lengths have shortened in contemporary popular cinema.Even if it just an action flick; and this film had the potential to be so much more, neatly balancing action with moral dilemma and questions of human nature; then it work far better if the audience could be able to see what was actually happening, to revel in all the special effects. And perhaps even the dialogue.It is designed to increase the pace of a film, to make it exciting, but there is no time to be excited or interested.",0
"First of all, I am very disappointed that this movie currently stands as no.1 of all time on IMDb listing. People, just remember the first time you watched the Matrix, Godfather, Braveheart, any Stanley Kubrick movie, and the list goes on.I think IMDb should take this matter seriously and reconsider its rating system, because I have been using this website for god knows how long as a reliable way to select movies to watch and compare my taste.Let me tell you that I actually went to see this movie a second time to really make up my mind.Now, why such a low rating, why soo serious?? Well, first of all, I am a big fan of Batman and a big fan of Christian Bale, but, unfortunately, I have to say this was his worst acting role. I think the direction or production forgot about the Batman for this movie, there is no darkness in his character, no depth, no inner struggle, I mean Christian Bale himself looks bored. The comments of Alfred on the other hand, as his ""adviser"" are just useless, a poor performance from another great actor. I don't want to continue criticizing the actors, but it doesn't get any better as I think of the other actors. Heath Ledger may have pulled off a very good performance though, he was very good, but I mean we saw him maybe 30 minutes in the movie, and some parts were too predictable.OK, so, what makes this movie so disappointing? It is no longer a comic movie and we have to many ""real"" elements. A vigilante wearing a mask and using his wealth to have amazing gadgets, fighting against a psycho, who's motives we don't even really find out, what made him the way he is: a self proclaimed ""agent of chaos"". We also have a harvey dent, who has the highest morals and who is incorruptible, or maybe not. The story is too long, the innovative schemes that Batman comes up with to stop the Joker are over the top and simply too unrealistic. In order to achieve making the Joker look super intelligent and a mastermind, all the direction does is make sure the rest of the characters are very stupid. I mean, leaving him uncuffed??? Come on? OK, so, do the action scenes and special effects save the day? NOPE! Remember the chase scene in Ronin? Remember the robbery scene in Heat? Not comparable.I'm sorry, but everything in this movie is sub par! This is a mediocre high budget flick, with nothing genuine to offer. A cheap ripoff and attempt to reintroduce the story of Batman without any twists. How is it that the movie lasts almost 3 hours if not more, and there is no story development what so ever. Oh wait sorry, by the end of the movie, Batman becomes the bad guy, yeah okay...I can go on and on but I am just starting to lose my calm. Hollywood, wake up, World wake up, if you think this was a good movie, then, I suggest you watch idiocracy, and maybe you will recognize it as a true vision of the future.So disappointed.... 4/10 (or maybe I am still being generous)",0
"After reading numerous reviews on IMDb and other websites, and also finding out that the movie got the top position in the IMDb Top 250, I expected to see something really special when I got to the cinema. However, all my expectations faded away throughout the 2 and half hours of ""Dark Knight"".Probably, the only outstanding performance is Heath Ledger, whose character is for sure the most charismatic guy of the story. On contrary, Batman looks cold and boring. The pace of the movie is a bit too chill down and relaxed in the beginning with all the action starting after 1/3 of the ""Dark Knight"". Story is rather good and often unpredictable. However, there are many illogical situations so much typical for blockbusters. For instance, at the end, why should Batman confess that he killed several good guys, if it would have been much easier to tell everybody that Joker did all that? Movie is full simplistic, naive assumptions about human behaviour in different situations.In sum, it's not a bad movie, probably it's worth to watch it once, but I really don't understand how could it get such reviews and rankings.",0
"OK, ignore the so called ""great opening scene"" of the bank robbery. It's good but its nothing to be spouting the word ""brilliant"" over. The 2nd scene with fake batmen is better but you don't know who the real Batman is, especially when he's talking like he's got a really sore throat or is doing an incredibly poor Clint Eastwood ""Dirty Harry"" impression.And that's what ruins his dialogue with Chief Gordon in the 3rd scene in the bank vault and in the rest of the movie in fact. Call me old fashioned but I like to be able to HEAR clearly what the lead character in a movie has to say.The movie looks OK, its suitably dark in places. The plot is average at best with The Joker robbing mob banks to get their attention so he can offer to kill Batman for half their money. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker is unimpressive, its not this ultra-dark madman that all the critics & fans will have you believe it is. Cesar Romero's Joker was scarier than that. Jack Nicholson's Joker buries Ledger & keeps the shovel as a souvenir.Ledger's Joker is not only not scary he's also a liar who can't keep his stories straight. Like the story of how he got the scars on his face. That his father did it or that he did it to himself with a razor to appease his wife.In the scene where they are having the parade for the dead Commissionar is that Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh as one of The Jokers gunmen? We're shown Gordon is killed (and the movie just jumped the shark at that exact moment) and then Bruce Wayne offers to turn himself in as Batman to stop Joker's killing spree.Local District Attorney Harvey Dent organises a press conference then outs himself as Batman to the surprise of Bruce Wayne.During the prisoner transfer scene there's lots of views of Lower Whacker Drive so yet again this was filmed in Chicago and they obviously don't think anyone has ever seen The Blues Brothers. More vehicle chase and the ONLY good moment of Ledger's Joker is him demanding Batman run him down on the motorcycle then Joker is captured & its revealed Gordon wasn't really dead & he's appointed Commissionar.Telling Batman he's captured Dent & Rachel (Batman's love interest from the previous film) he then reveals where they both are so Batman can only rescue one of them. Batman goes to where he thinks Rachel is but it turns out that's where Dent is. Rachel is killed in an explosion (unfortunately her ""dead"" body blinks when we see it) and half of Dent's face is burnt (this is how he becomes Two-Face).Having distracted Batman & the Police away from the station Joker uses his phone-call to detonate a bomb inside one of his men then goes to find the Japanese Mob boss that the police had in custody.The trouble with the movie is it's at least 1 hour too long. It takes too long for Dent to become Two-Face, it takes Joker too long to put his millions of plans into action & achieve all their aims. Threatening the hospitals to allow Joker to get to Dent. The other back story (fronted by Two-Face) of 2 traitors within Gordon's unit (with the 2nd turning about to be Gordon's PA) is played alongside the main plot of The Joker trying to get people to kill each other is just one of the reasons why this movie is too long by an hour. You can't have 2 villains with 2 different agenda's. Pick 1 guy and 1 story and stick with it.In the hostage situation it was painfully obvious that the clowns were hostages as soon as Gordon looked at them through the binoculars (only a brain dead idiot didn't work THAT out in a microsecond). To have Batman attacked by dogs a 2nd time is just to return to the start of the movie (and whats the point in doing that so close to the damn ending!) and we already knew he'd improved the costume to be bite-proof so this was a pointless scene.The only really good scene in the whole movie is the reaction of the prisoners on the ferry (throwing their detonator out of the window). The conversation between Joker & Batman is too long and pointless, the movie should end right there (actually it should have ended over an hour ago but that's beside the point) but the director felt the need to close his final storyline with Gordon confronting Two-Face (not like Gordon ever did anything to Dent but why let a huge plot-hole like that spoil you dragging out the ending of your movie).Two-Face shows exactly how weak (for weak read ""incredibly crap paper thin plot idea"") his justification of taking Gordon's family is. When a villain is actually telling you the audience that his motives are crap, you (Warner Studio's) should really be considering sacking the person who wrote the script as he's completely derailing himself as having a believable motive.Two-Face shooting Batman is pointless as the audience already known his costume was upgraded with Kevlar after the 2nd scene. The ending (if you can call it that) is sheer crap. Batman telling Gordon to make Dent a posthumous hero & blame the deaths he had caused on Batman. Batman telling Gordon to send the police after him. And not finding out what happened to The Joker. An incredibly weak movie, WAY too long for its own good. Too many villains with individual story lines to follow. What little ending there is is left gapingly open to allow for a sequel.",0
"The movie wasn't exactly bad but certainly doesn't belong in the top 250. I'm not a big fan of Nolan's view of Gotham City. Tim Burton made the city look very surreal in his two Batman movies, whereas Nolan wanted to make a very realistic and dull looking city.The film's biggest problem is the plot. The movie felt at least an hour longer than it actually was because of it. It has way too many characters and elements, and it's ultimately a long and boring mess. It doesn't even have a proper ending, it just hints at things to come. I also was longing for more action scenes. The movie only has like one slightly longer action scene, and even that isn't that great. There are smaller scenes here and there, but they are usually ruined by crappy editing, which doesn't allow you to see what's actually happening.The best part of the movie is Heath Ledger's Joker, even though the character suffers from poor development. We only learn that he had a difficult childhood and that's it. Ledger still manager to make him a very disturbing character.Don't believe the hype and make your own conclusion.",0
"Seeing Batman: The Dark KNight is the event of the year. That makes it exciting. The problem with this film is that its too long. 30 minutes need to be cut out. The story is not sufficiently written to carry the film for its full length. Whatever any one says there is a load of padding in the filming to take it to its 152 minutes. Blockbusters need to be epics its seems. Even if the story has to be stretched to fill the time. How many times does Jim Gordon have to say ""The Joker meant us to be here?"" Christian Bale broods and broods and ... broods! No wonder we haven't heard very much about him in previews on his performance. He doesn't do very much. Aaron Eckheart's good guy DA is the only clear moral character out of all them in Githam. Its a dark and violent city returning to the original comic book stories. All very well but you need more story to support it. Heath Ledger as predicted steals every scene and is having wild fun with a huge character where everyone else is subdued compared to his Joker. It owes a debt to Jack Nicholson's Joker with whom it has been compared. Its largely good as a blockbuster but is over-hyped and the advertising surpasses its expectations",0
"Batman Begins was a more complete film.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!I hated the way they dealt with the Scarecrow in the beginning. It was like they said, ""How can we get rid of this character as fast as possible?"" Shouldn't the Scarecrow have been on the ferry at the end of the film?I hate the way Batman fought in this film. In the first film it was about deception and stealthiness. In this film, it was about just going out and fighting. Lame.Heath Ledger was good and fun. Christian Bale went a little overboard with his ""Batman voice."" In the first film it worked because he barely talked. In this film, it got really annoying and started to sound comedic.They never explained how Gordon survived the gunshot. If they did, I missed it.There were more problems with this film than the first one. It wasn't as refreshing and I think it's being completely over hyped.",0
"I'm not going to comment on individual performances or technical aspects, these are covered elsewhere. What made TDK a disappointment for me was the loss of story halfway through. In the beginning, there are enough coherent scenes, strong supporting cast and even flashes of brilliance to tempt you into sticking with this latest episode in the comic-book-as-film-noir franchise, but TDK loses any sense of scale.The story leaves you high and dry; it loses any relation it had to an engaging story of complex supeheroes and übervillains, and becomes an unnecessarily complicated, overwrought, overstuffed mess. The film becomes like a nightmare fairground, where all the sideshows are at full volume, in your face, and all of them drowning each other out, in the hope that you won't notice that none of them are very interesting at all. Just like that mobile phone multiscreen towards the long-distant end, which doesn't make sense as a plot device, as a technical gizmo, or as anything that one operator could make head ot tail of. Minority Report had a similar imaginary device that looked believable: this wasn't, even in the post-Luc-Besson design world TDK is supposed to inhabit.The point where TDK quite literally loses the plot is when DA Dent is switched to become Two-Face, which would naturally be the point where you would expect the movie to end - except that the Joker isn't anywhere near being dealt with at that point: so TDK has to carry on with a completely new villain in order to resolve the story of the old villain - and it doesn't do that properly either.In all, TDK is like half a good film with a bad one tacked on the end, loaded with flashes and bangs in the hope you won't notice.",0
"I am very disappointed because up until now IMDb has never recommended so much a movie I consider unsatisfying. How can you put this movie as #1 ? Do you really think this is the best movie - if it is I should never watch cinema again !!!!!! Batman begins was a way better then this ! I am just coming from the local cinema where I saw the premiere - I was so thrilled all day long i was dreaming to watch such a big disappointment ! It is too long, too many people are involved in the scenes and sometimes you catch yourself trying to understand what the hell is going on ? Battle scenes and heroes like the joker are OK of course, but our number one should be much more then just effects don't you think so ?",0
"Hello Fanboys First of all, I'm sorry if my English is bad and I do mistakes, it is not my first language, I do my best.When I first watched the Dark Knight, people already called this movie the best movie of all time even before it was in the cinema. The hype was amazing, completely unreal. So I went to the premiere with my GF and some friends to see this ""Masterpiece"" Well, after 2,5 hours I can honestly say that I was never ever so disappointed and bored by a movie in my hole life. I even fell almost asleep.1. The movie is completely illogical and irrational. I say that, because the movie don't want to be a comic book adaptation, it want to be more, and it is simply not working. It is way to serious to be a comic book adaption but way to ridiculous for a serious movie. For example the Dent into 2-Face Transformation.2. There is no real plot in the movie! Absolutely none, nothing, not existing. I could have name every scene after 5 seconds watching how the ""plot"" will be. For example the beginning. After the first kill, you knew exactly how this will end. Or the boat scene, I mean is there really anybody out there who was impressed by this ""twist""? If you have seen 1 movie before in your life, that scene cant be a surprise for you. I have limited room for this review but I could name hundreds of these not working mini plots and so called twist's.3. The dialogues where extremely bad. Most of them where monologues and really pointless. I always had the feeling that the movie wanted to be ""cool"" by any means but had no idea how to achieve that properly.4. The acting was sub-par. I would even say, Bale was horrible. I don't get why people say Ledger was such a good Joker. Okay, he died, we get that, and all the fans want to honor him, but please stay realistic. His acting was okay, nothing special.5. The voice of Batman... Seriously, who finds that cool? It was simply hilarious and I felt ashamed for the director.6. The movie looked awful. I really enjoy when I movies deliver nice screenplay and an awesome soundtrack, but that was not the case. Gotham looks like any other boring town, the trip to china was absolutely meaningless and just a waste of time. The batman costume looks bad and the joker is not freighting or funny or disturbing or whatever.7. No emotion. The movie had no breath, no life. No drama, no good action, no good characters, no humor, just nothing. The movie simply had no soul. There is simply nobody I would really miss if they die in the movie. I have to admit that I forgot most of the characters names after watching it and that never happen to me when I watch a good, compelling movie.The only good thing about The Dark Knight was the soundtrack, but that wont safe the day. What should a good soundtrack do, when the rest is garbage? For me TDK is the most overrated movie of all time. I am amazed how easy it is to impress an audience just with some hype, a dead actor and tons of explosion. R.I.P Hollywood",0
"nop.they should stop making batman movies before making more like this.was disappointed by too many things in this movie - first of all the joker. while well acted this is just not the real one - Jack Nicholson's role was so much better... this one is just a twisted overdone ""terrorist"". yeah, you can guess it - the second thing i strongly disliked ... too much use of that t-word in recent years... and should i mention the link-the-cellphones-and-see-everything technology? too powerful and too much for a man, but for this one case we will use it and after it destroy it .... yeah ... cheesy.yeah, and the batman is running around and screaming like a dumb brute ... not exactly what he should be...many stars, nice acting, bad script and action - bad movie",0
"The tragedy about most movies in the last 20 years is that the scripts and acting mean nothing. It is all about CGI....and that is SO sad. This crap is just another example. If you like ""Super-heroes"" you may enjoy this. I dislike Super-heroes (perhaps ..because I have a brain) However--lots of people LOVE this kind of trash..Heath Ledger won an Oscar for his ridiculous performance...He was actually an above average actor, but this whole pile of nonsense was just...very bad. Batman or Superman ? Both are better in the magazines...The young folks who spend half their lives looking at their Smart-Phones (trying to work out how to use them !!) Will love a movie where you don't need to use your brain.",0
"Although a far, far cry from the cheeseball shoe days of Tommy Lee Shoes, Jim 'sneakers' Carry and Big Boots Arnie camping it up as the bad guys and their shoes, I still had a problem engaging with this film. Not sure why. Maybe there were too many characters and not enough Batman shoe action (I mean, you've got Morgan Oldman, Gary Gyllenhall, Maggie Oldman, Heath Dale, Michael Ledger and Christian Caine to keep track of and that's only the actors who's name I can remember with absolute clarity just now). Also, the film is about seven hours long and very little of it involves footwear. Also: Eric Roberts _ forgot about him and his white spatz. This time the heavily convoluted non-shoe story involves the triumvirate of policeman Gary Oldman, lawyer Harvey Dent, and The Batman trying to take down the mafia by hitting shoes warehouse through Gotham while trying to protect the legit shoe industry. They confiscate this huge shipment of shoes but there a jackboot amongst the plimsoles in the form of the Cobbler, who's nuts and keeps asking people how they think he got his shoes. It's up to Batman etc to sort this guy out but to be honest there's an old saying that goes ""The craziest shoes wins the day"" and by all accounts the Cobbler, even though he says he's an agent of Chaos, is the most Organised and pre-planning criminal since the killer in Se7en(shoes). Batman here is all caught up in some sort of shoe triangle with local lawyer/nike designer Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhall's deck shoes, which leads to all sorts of redundancy when they could have been concentrating on stitching and designer laces. The Cobbler however is playing all sorts of crazy games, replacing shoes with loaves of bread, tying people laces together and looking like Robert Smith of the Cure far too much for his own good. Maybe I'm too much of a shoe fan and not enough of a loads of characters fan, but I found this a bit of a slog. I am also confused by Bales (or Dale?) dropping his voice several thousand octaves every time he was Batman. I did like the bit where the Cobbler set fire to his share of the mafia shoes and then sailed down the East River in a giant Doc Martin while drinking champagne from a stiletto heel.",0
"I watched the first of the trilogy yesterday, Batman Begins and thought it was a great film. So i watched this today and felt compelled to write a review. I have never reviewed any film before. My problem is with the Joker and instead of the one or two quick lines we are used to from the joker in previous films and the series, we are treat with a freezing of time while the joker bores us with a minute plus of not very well delivered boredom and the other character in the scene keep silent and listens. This happens all the way through the movie and ruins it. I had heard people rave about heath ledgers performance but they must be young uns who didn't grow up with the American series and then jack Nicholson's excellent portrayal. It was basically a toned down bad copy of jn. Now i know its fantasy and we have to stretch our imagination but there was a point in the film where i nearly turned it off as it simply was beyond belief. Dents loved one has been killed by the joker and he has a gun pointing at him and doesn't kill him. WTF? Heath ledgers dialogue probably bored him into a coma or sent him to sleep. But there is no way if you loved someone and had their killer at your mercy and you had already shown in the film that you were prepared to take a life that you wouldn't have killed him. Sorry i could not get over that. Especially after that point Dent then kills people who were peripheral to Rachels death!!! How the film gets 9/10 on here i haven't a clue. Come on people how can you paper over a massive plot hole like that?",0
"I know this is considered the end all and be all of comic book movies. Let's face it this movie fails on so many levels. I am all in for changing characters for the better but this is terrible. We'll start off with Christian Bale and his voice he sounds like he overworked his throat. This movie would of been perfect to add Robin and bring the dynamic duo to the big screen. I mean what is Batman without Robin? Let's move on to the villains shall we? Ledger Joker was well a.... Joke he took all the fun out of the role. Two Face was okay I guess I myself prefer Tommy Lee Jones(I might be a little bias being a Texan myself) He was truly the only thing that made this movie watchable and made me begrudgingly give it two stars instead on the one star it deserves. I think we can all agree that this far from the masterpiece of comic book movies that was Adam West's Batman movie,",0
"Batman movies have been rather interesting. Forget Adam West and the original TV series I'm starting from Keaton and going beyond. The first two were dark and Gothic and quite frankly perfectly watchable. Then they dropped it down a few notches and made Batman Forever followed by the god awful Batman & Robin and the whole Batman movie thing had gone in a quite frankly painful to watch direction.Then they started from scratch with Batman Begins which I thought was p*ss poor to say then very least and seemed to miss the whole point of ""The"" Batman for me. Then The Dark Knight arrived, the movie started well due to the performance of Ledger as the Joker and I will agree he did the role justice and was very memorable but his death made him a martyr and the movie road on that wave beyond the success it would have originally have.I think of the Dark Knight and I think of the bomb scene with the civilians and the cons, beyond that I struggle to think of one single scene thats beyond generic.As far as Batman movies are concerned its the best one since Burton had the reigns but don't believe the hype, a movie shouldn't be carried on the back of one single actor...especially if a large percentage of that weight is carried because of his tragic passing.The Dark Knight is perfectly watchable but Heath Ledgers fantastic performance in my eyes is the films downfall in the grand scheme of things.",0
"OK. First I am a BIG fan of BATMAN and especially batman villains. To me JOKER is even bigger than the good guy. And I have 5 elements that are the key to a great movie: direction, story, music, acting and atmosphere in the movie. And the Batman saga is all about atmosphere. I watch all 6 BATMAN movies. Tim Burton was good. Joel Schumacher had some good moments in the 3 but blow up at 4 batman. Christopher Nolan is bad. His Batman Begins was bad. The Dark Knight isn't bad...it's dead. THIS MOVIE IS DEAD! Sure it's a expensive project but do something with the money!I don't wanna pay a ticket to see a trailer that lasts 2.5 hours.The story is the center not the stupid special effects!I love Batman and I still believe in Hollywood,but he is bringing me down... Dark...very dark!",0
"This movie should be named ""Life With Batman"", because by the end of it you will have felt like you've spent half of your life with Bruce Wayne & Co. I am really surprised that there are SO many glowing user reviews here. This movie has its moments, but it really is WAY TOO LONG & SELF-INDULGENT!!! I generally like comic books & comic book-movies, but Dark Knight really misses the mark for me. Someone should've had the courage to tell Christopher Nolan to reign this in a bit and trim things down. I had already set low expectations for this, as it is the usual over-hyped sequel. For a while the movie pleasantly surprised me and exceeded my expectations handily. Foremost, I did not expect Heath Ledger's performance to be as good as the hype. But, he definitely did pull off a brutal & realistic portrayal of a terribly disturbed psychopath. The scenes with Joker should have stayed. The ""extra stuffing"" should have been trimmed (namely a whole mid-movie sub thread with Two-Face, and unnecessary exposition with Gordon & others).While ""Batman Begins"" was a flawed but excellent movie, ""The Dark Knight"" is a flawed but monolithic schizophrenic of a movie. From an early scene with 'copycat' heroes & villains, to bad Two-Face makeup & his unbelievable subplot; this is a movie that wants to be ""so Serious"", but should take its own advice from Joker: ""Why So Serious?"" --This was a problem that peeped its head out in the first movie (an incredibly realistic portrayal of Batman, marred by silly fantastical leaps-from-reality like ""remote control bats"" to ""Batmobile indiscriminately crushing cop cars --the good guys-- to save his girl""). In this movie, these type of moments are multiplied 10-fold and really do a disservice to all the good scenes that ARE in the film.Performances are all up-to-par, with Ledger stealing the show, but Maggie Gyllenhaul really PALES in comparison to Katie Holmes. (What, did Cruise have her under lock-and-key like the tabloids say?) Katie is way cuter & sexier, and just a better fit for the role. Here again, in the utter sincerity of the acting, this just makes the end scenes with a hopelessly silly melodramatic plot device make fun of all those great Caine, Ledger, & Bale performances that came before it.I wish I could make my own cut of this movie. With some judicious splicing (and some large removals of Two-Face scenes), this movie could be a 90min wild ride with standout performances & great cat-and-mouse play between Batman & Joker. Instead, it's an overlong ode to Hollywood excess and over-indulgence that (in its end, although no were near AS bad) eventually reminded me of Spider-man 3's ""lost ways"".",0
"Loved Batman Begins. Then it seems like Christopher Nolan lost his love-if he ever had it - for the source material. I am a huge Batman fan and will give any adaptation my full support. I can usually get something out of it. The more I watch the 2 Dark Knight movies, the more I hate them, and the more I think that Nolan was never a Batman fan.The stories are poorly thought out but that's not exactly Nolan's fault. It's how he introduces our heroes and villains that make me question his passion for the projects. In a scene that looks like it was shot by my older brother and his friends with a $40 video camera, Batman is introduced only after seeing a few pathetic Batman copycats, then we see him running through a parkade, after a car. He is indistinguishable at this point from the copycats. Not how I wanna be reintroduced to my favorite comic book character - in a fluorescent lit parkade, uncertain if it's even him. Where's the mystique? Wheres the darkness? The mythos? Where's the fear he's supposed to bring with him? It's all washed out.The second bad ENTRANCE was with, the most significant villain in comic book lore, the Joker. I know everybody loves Heath (R.I.P) but I cannot approve of his portrayal. Firstly, the Joker, THE JOKER, is introduced when he casually walks into a scene reminiscent of a scene out of Dick Tracy, where a bunch of corny, campy, bad guys exchange dialogue in what is supposed to be a meeting of Gotham's underworld kings. Then, some nobody strolls into this BASEMENT with his henchmen, like a background character might, does some tongue acting, then puts the screws to the crime bosses with no opposition. How did the Joker even find out about this meeting? And how was he allowed to waltz in - with no charisma might I say. Where's the evil? Where's the man behind the face paint? Where's the unbridled lunacy? The key to a good villain is that you want to hate him but you can't help but love him. I couldn't find the Joker, a Joker, any Joker, in any minute of Ledgers performance. His characters ability to predict the multitude of variables that had to occur for his plan to go off is unbelievable, even for the truest of believers. Agent of chaos or not, I need my Joker to be somewhat grounded, connected to something, to have SOME motivation. Some cause for his direction.I've already been lambasted by the people around me so I understand if this review will upset people. Im happy there are so many die-hard, passionate Dark Knight fans. But I have to state what is so obvious to me: shot for shot, this is a train wreck. Oldmans comatose performance as Gordon, the purposeless, tacked-on fight scene near the end of the movie. All of it. Just can't do it.It's plot is challenging in many ways, absolutely stupid in most others. No rendition will ever ruin Batman for me. But the follow-up, Dark Knight Rises - which I also hated - cemented to me, the lack of love on Nolan's part.",0
"** Spoilers It is very sad that this movie is in the top 10, Not much to say about it, series of short-length clips, with cool vs uncool characters. No surprises. No attachment to characters. Absurd endless dialogues. Drama queens all the way. This is just empty. The joker could never ever get the ability to put these things together if he didn't care about ""plans"". Oh I'll do a spoiler now that I'm at it. The batman survives. He is going to be hunted even when he didn't do anything wrong. So unfair. Movie illustrates that people (even criminals) are very good at the core, but there are crazy people like the joker in the world, so this movie is really useful to show us that. Oh, and Morgan Freeman can track phone calls of 30M ppl simultaneously. :D",0
"I am no great movie reviewer or anything special. I just watch movies and I like what I like. everybody was hyping this movie like it was the greatest movie and adults went and seen this movie at the theater and actually paid to see it numerous times. I was expecting this movie to be great. to me it was boring and I quit watching it about halfway through and came back and watch the ending. this movie is over-hyped by people who wanted this movie to be great and made it great in their own heads because they wanted it to be. the movie did not make sense and thing where done in the movie that could not of possibly be done even in the comic books. I don't know why heath ledger was given the academy award. the joker did not make any sense and jack nicholson played the joker better than heath ledger, without a doubt. mickey rourke was more deserving. the problem is most people wanted this to be a great movie and they went and seen it and must have said to themselves this is suppose to be a great movie and actually made it one because of the hype. the batman movies made in the 1990's were good movies especially the first one with michael keaton playing batman and jack as the joker. from the start of this movie I was lost. it was too long and was filled with a bunch of non sense commmotion.",0
"I would like to start this out by stating that I LIKED Batman Begins. I felt that the whole entrance to attempt to make things ""logical"" and ""realistic"" (as far as comic book movies go) was refreshing and adult. Its difficult as an adult to easily suspend disbelief or compensate loopholes with imagination where there exist such obvious loopholes sometimes. Sometimes you need more ""detail"" in the story to make it better in some places... I felt like this was one of those movies: Convoluted, ill-paced, and at times, ridiculous. Even for a comic book movie.What was good enough about this movie that I rated it a 4? It was ""cool"". I enjoyed the effects and at minimum was entertained (started shifting in my chair 3/4 through though, after beginning to notice how long I have actually been sitting there...not a good feeling for watching an ""epic movie""). Loved the bike, loved the car, LOVED Heath Ledger. He was brilliant....I WILL defend his ""smacking lips"" that some are actually filtering into the ""bad"" aspects of this. Here's a hint: IT IS SUPPOSED TO ANNOY YOU! He's a madman with ticks, quirks, and no doubt the smacking was created (and obviously deliberately emphasized) as something that was created from the cuts on the character's lips. I forgot he was Heath Ledger only minutes into the film...incredible, incredible performance, he deserves all the praise he is currently getting.The bad: The story. I get it, sometimes being a hero is not about being glorified, but taking the fall. That IS a superhero in a nutshell....and the development of that idea was good....but....it seemed like there was way too much work throughout the movie to arrive at something so.......... simple. I was awaiting a profound catharsis to make me think ""WOW"" and not a 'well, this is it after all of that'. Maggie Gyllenhaal was decent, though I have no idea what they were thinking in casting her. She did pull off the ""strong"" part of the character well, because she isn't attractive enough to be assumed as an airhead (sorry). It isn't just about that though... I found her dull, and almost apathetic. Maybe that was the point? Im not sure.Bale as batman is OK....I'll take it.... the over-the-top voice became ridiculous, and actually unintentionally comical though. I felt like I was listening to ""Brock from a 1-900 line"" at times.They went through SO much effort to explain the physics of the Batman costume, vehicles, details of how Sonar would work, that I started to become excited and interested...until the creation of two-face. I had a very difficult time accepting a man with such exposed burned/raw skin would be able to snarl and strut around without being.....well, the slightest bothered to the HUGE chance of infection/irritation. It was so ridiculous that I actually started to ponder details.... How is the exposed eyeball looking completely healthy when he has NO eyelid to moisten? How is he able to perfectly pronounce speech when he is missing half of his mouth/lips?? Go ahead...try to partially speak through only your teeth and see if it works that well. It was ridiculous. His transformation and ""meeting"" with the joker was disappointingly quick. The joker gives him a 4 minute pep talk and it was kind of ""well, that was easy"". There was little to no internal conflict, self-reasoning....he literally went from someone who SHOULD NOT be unable to function with muscle, bone, jaw, eyeball exposed to.... a child murdering thug? Huh? Then, after ALL the ups and downs in the film...batman rides off because he has to take the fall because ""sometimes heroes do that"". That was the conclusion? OK, that was ALSO easy....so.....is that it?? Really? REALLY?",0
"This movie wasn't a disappointment, because I didn't expect anything better. This pointless piece of... shortened my life about 2,5 hours. Total waste of time and money. Cesar Romero was much better joker than that untalented schoolboy.If I could go back in time, I would warn myself about this... movie.Considering how this movie has been rated, internet, movies and television should be prohibited for anyone under 30.Make the right decision. Don't spend your money.Minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text. So I have to write some random gibberish.",0
"Spoilers: I am trying to figure out if I saw the same movie all these teenage boys are coming on here and claiming to be the best movie ever. Back in grade school when I was learning to write there was a concept called a run-on sentence. This was including too many ideas in one long un-punctuated line. This is essentially what the filmmakers gave us with Dark Knight. This film is in MAJOR need of an editor.First off all, there are way too many plots and subplots going on. Both the Joker and the Two Face story lines should have been treated as separate movies. Watching this movie I felt myself to be bored and was constantly looking at my watch. At over two and a half hours, this film was way too long. Compare this to a fast paced, entertaining well edited film like Plains, Trains, and Automobiles and you see how longer doesn't mean better. There were at least 3 incidents with the joker that I thought was the conclusion to the movie only to have it drag on for another long anti-climatic showdown.Secondly, I had never really thought of Michael Keaton as Batman, but after seeing Christian Bale's portrayal, Keaton is looking better and better every day. Unlike Keaton, or even Val Kilmer, Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is an extremely unlikeable character. A total jerk I felt little sympathy for unlike the affable Bruce Wayne Keaton gave us in the scene where Vicky Vale is looking at his collection of Samuri outfits. Batman Begins has a stupid beginning and an utterly idiotic ending, but at least the middle portion of that movie was entertaining. The Dark Knight was a complete bore.Another thing is that Ledger's Joker character came off more like the psycho loner from the original Dirty Harry film than the charismatic villain from the comics. And in this supposedly ""realistic"" interpretation of the Batman concept, the Jokers henchmen came across as the worst from the 60's TV show.All in all this movie was a disappointment, a real boring mess.",0
why does everyone like this movie? it's not particularly that good.and everything in it is just so so wrong. it's OK for the government and the people in charge to lie to the masses? the masses (that's you) are too stupid to rule themselves? it's OK to use people's private cell phone info? (oh just this one time... morgan freeman says... thanks)this is a fascist film. it is fascist propagandawake up people you should be outragedthe movie is tell the audience you are idiots and look how easily we control you and make you think this is some great movie and look how much money we can make off your desperate desires...thank god obama became president - this movie seemed to be financed by the bush administrative prepping people for more BS.who is this batman? oh so troubled batman? he's a rich white boy with guilt - he doesn't want to play along so he goes out and inflicts the masses with his own morals - which turns out to be exactly the same as his fellow rich white boys that rule.poor little rich white boy... this is a scary scary propaganda movie.ten years from now we'll look back at this in horror.,0
"This movie had too much action for me. Unlike everybody else in the world nowadays, I don't care for action movies. I lost interest about halfway through the film. Maybe when you've actually seen lots of blood and gore in the real world it spoils action packed movies for you. It seems to have done so for me. This film does have more characterization and plot development than most action movies. I think that's why it's been so highly rated. I found the plot puerile, however. I will say this for The Dark Knight,though: it is probably one of the most cerebral action movies to date. Unfortunately, cloaking a comic book in realism can't hide its' true colors.",0
"Until it drops below the Godfather, the Good, The Bad and Ugly and any number of other films that are just that bit better in an historical context.This does upset me slightly as it is in itself a very good film as the other reviews say. The Ledger is Dead / Batman Fans just went a bit overboard with the 10/10 scores at the start leaving us poor schmucks at the back of the queue to mark it down to where it should be.What do I think? Honestly? Well 7's on IMDb are usually a good watchable evening's entertainment 8's are things you would make a point of staying in for, tipping or buying the DVD and anything 9+ is one of the best movies ever made. Yes, this one is an 8.something for sure as I would go out of my way to watch it again....But the scoring correction continues so 1 star it is :)",0
"Truthfully, it's not a ""1"" either, but I feel compelled to balance out all the people who are giving it a ""10"". If I were able to give it an honest rating, it would probably be a 5 out of 10, which is still pretty awful, but well-deserved.This film is a pathetic sequel to a promising re-invention of the Batman franchise (Batman Begins). I have huge respect for Christopher Nolan, mostly for ""Memento"", which has an HONEST rating of 8.6 on IMDb and justifiably ranks in the top 250 greatest films. I make the distinction because I don't think ""The Dark Knight"" is being rated honestly. The current rating of 9.4 is so obviously a sympathy-vote for Heath Ledger (who does a fantastic job) that IMDb should disqualify the rating as tainted.I won't give anything away, because there's truthfully not much to give away in the first place. The story line is as schizophrenic and chaotic as the Joker himself. The internal logic of the film is all over the map and leads to a very unsatisfying conclusion. If the result was an ""art"" film, then a disjointed story might be forgivable, but that's not the case. This is a pedantic, boring, formulaic summer ""blockbuster"" film masquerading as a piece of art.As I said, Heath Ledger's Joker is a great characterization, even if it does draw noticeably on Nicholson's portrayal. Ledger is undeniably fun to watch, which is more than I can say for Christian Bale. Bale is a passable Bruce Wayne, but, in this film, he's an extremely dull Batman. And what's with his voice? Was that his idea, or Nolan's direction? If you're going to utter dialogue sounding as if you've just gargled battery acid, it can be effective only as a brief, energetic exclamation, preferably monosyllabic. However, if you try to speak for 5 minutes in this manner, it becomes not only distracting, but comical. Any time Batman distressed his vocal cords for more than 10 seconds, spontaneous laughter broke out all over the packed theater. I'm sure this is not the response that Nolan envisioned for these parts of the film.To sum it all up, seeing this film would be a complete waste of time if it wasn't for Heath Ledger. Wait for it to come out on video. If you want to see a really good comic adaptation, then go see ""Ironman"". Even ""Fantastic 4"", which was a big disappointment to me, was a better comic adaptation than ""The Dark Knight"".",0
"I have a habbit to pick out movies That are a waste of time for me and this was an example for me, I First tried it when I was younger and basically didnt understand That much english and now I am older but still dont understand the fuzz and hype 'round this movie, the only great aspect of It was the joker until the third act and then he became also garbage.",0
"Sorry. It's just an overrated film. I have heard many people telling me to go see this ""amazing"" film. It has to much pyrotechnics in it. I just don't care for it. It really is overrated. If you like explosions and good vs. evil movies then go see it. The role of women in the film was just sad. Mostly shown as toys. Just didn't like it.Christopher Nolan did wonders with Interstellar, but, in my opinion, this film just doesn't cut it. I guess it something people will like more if they are into superheros. I don't like how they showed the female characters either. I just don't like it.Hopefully, Christopher Nolan will release more masterpieces like Interstellar.",0
"I Simply have to give this movie some marks for its incredible special effects, i loved them, Now if they where in a good movie! Now there would be something worth watchingI Can name at least 5 movies i have seen in the past two weeks so far that are better than this, in fact i think i will;Transformers Step Brothers Blue Harvest (although not entirely a movie but you get the idea) Benders Big Game Fear and Loathing in Las VegasAlmost all of these movies are no where near in my top 10 favourite movies, but yet i would rather watch anyone 100 times than watch this piece of rubbish again.I Had such high expectations for this film and everyone was talking about it, but wow did it suck, If it wasn't for the late Heath Ledgers amazing acting i would probably have cried nearing the end of this movie.Thankyou for your time xox",0
"The Dark Knight's marketing campaign was very luring and the super charged trailers for this multi produced dark and monotone film were done very well, tempting the moviegoer's curiosity. The film starts off on a somewhat implausible crime and an introduction to the evil that Batman will have to face. Gotham is in trouble. It seems that since the 911 attacks several films have been portraying destruction and violence in a form of terrorism. The Dark Knight has a parable to the current terror that the Western World is facing and fighting against. The Joker, Batman's antagonist in the film is the symbol for this new terrorism...he is a disturbing character that is faced with impossible feats of terror. The film jolts the senses and keeps the consciousness focused on defeating this terror and how but, the impossible meets the impossible and a reminder that this all comic book fun with a little propaganda involved. It's the hero's journey done all over again. Cinematographer Wally Pfister's lighting is the best part of this hyped film. Heath Ledger played a great Character Role that has been played well in the past. Chistian Bale seemed bored and tired or perhaps that was his Character as batman would be tired and bored with existence and wondering why he is bothering when the cops in the film are portrayed as mediocre, corrupt, stupid...why would Batman continue...Rich, successful, powerful, superhero, attractive...The Dark Knight is full of questionable feats and watching the editing in places did not convince that what just occurred on film is too hard to accept even on comic book level. This empty and sad film leaves the senses the moment the car door shuts. Like a rickety roller-coaster...glad to see the credits role.",0
"This is indeed the worst of Batman's movies just because they have tried to make of it the best of them all and failed. This time besides the lots of action and explosions and computer made effects all of excellent quality, they have tried to inject also lots of philosophy and morals in the movie. The former turned out very cheap and the latter rather manichean in the sense of drawing a straight line between good and evil like if it was black and white and tried to pass a message on that. These action movies have everything to gain if they stay just in the aesthetic area where they belong: to amuse and entertain and don't try to bite off more than one can chew, mainly their usual fans. We don't expect of these movies a deep story but only the usual cheap one so it's better they don't try to sell us something more than good action and excellent images and visual sequences. Furthermore the story in this movie is full of unexplained flaws and loose ends. It has so many loose ends indeed that when they try to tie them up in the end to make a plausible finale (happy or unhappy end that wouldn't matter) they are unable to do it and the movie ends abruptly in the middle of the story in a poor way (like if they think of making a further episode but that's what you do when you don't know what to do to end it properly). Let's hope that the next episode of this saga is more modest in its pretensions and is then able to be classified as a good movie.",0
"Perhaps if this movie had been rated R, I would have been prepared for the graphic brutality of it. Instead, I found myself thinking that I just wanted to walk out. Yes, the production values are high and the performances are good, but I didn't need to spend ten bucks, only to want to look away from the screen repeatedly. Eventually, I rationalized that one of the points of the movie was to show Gotham's descent into chaos and crime. It did that very well. And the situation with the two ferry boats, and its resolution, was intriguing. But if I'd have known how relentlessly depressing and violent the movie was going to be, I'd have stayed home. (Gotta say, I did like the bike!)",0
"Like the great Shakespeare wrote: ""Those with empty heads shall nothing say, and so remain like stones 'til Earth's last day"". This is how I would describe Christopher Nolan's ""THE DARK KNIGHT"".I have duly noted its infamous popularity, which I can only attribute to a lack of understanding regarding, first of all, the art of aesthetics; and second, philosophy. This needs perhaps some elaboration.As Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a famous nihilist, notes, a man like the Joker can only exist given certain ontological realities, one being the de facto existence of pure probability rather than a fixed set of Platonic universals. This demonstrates an alleged entanglement with quantum physics: A simulacrum of the nothingness onto which the concept of meaning is applied can, it seems, take us further into the kind of world-view dominated by the struggle for understanding. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle seems apparent here, especially given that the philosophy of quantum mechanics now shows us that there are, in fact, cats that can live multiple lives at once under certain conditions monitored by the sort of pluviophilic entities hinted at before - there is in fact nothing certain at all, and we are left wondering if there is even such a thing as reality. The apparent flatus voicis we can derive from this pandemonium, this godless hell, is, I take it, the main concern and theme of ""THE DARK KNIGHT"", embodied in the positivistic antihero The Joker.Why does the film not deliver on these seemingly apparent premises? In the words of famous French philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, there simply cannot exist a set of ontological realities without a de facto set of morals; without morals, there cannot even be reality. Epistemology would dictate that we cannot be sure even of that very uncertainty Planck detected in his discovery of quantum leaps during the 1950s. The same phenomena apply to art as well, hence my entanglement of the two into an amalgam. But as ought to be apparent by now, these morals are left to wither in a helix of inconsistency. This is, in conclusion, what is thoroughly wrong with ""THE DARK KNIGHT"".This does not say, however, that the movie lacks any value of entertainment. You can watch it, if you choose to turn your brain off for its faulty epistemology.****/10",0
"Just re-watched ""Dark Knight"" (2008), from the purchased Blu-Ray trilogy. I had rented this once years ago but had not seen it since then. My opinion about this movie has not changed. Sure, it was well done, but I still am mystified by the incredible adulation this movie gets.The single thing that I hated the most was the incredibly ridiculous, over-the-top effectiveness of the Joker. Come on. Even if he was connected like, say, someone in the Trust from 100 Bullets (a comic book reference), he couldn't have pulled off the grandiose schemes that he executes flawlessly again and again. Then, add on top of that, he's supposed be a psychopathic mad dog, and it becomes utter nonsense. ""World's greatest detective"" is transformed into guy desperately trying to stop someone who's so much better than he is that it's not even funny.Some of the basic themes of the movie were interesting and well done, like the idea of the Joker that everyone is just one bad day from being like him (the same basic theme in ""Killing Joke""). But really, if the Joker could pull the stunts he did in this movie, he could have had the entire country on its knees in days. Sheesh. Sorry, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief that far. Not only would one need to have incredibly meticulous planning, one would also need inconceivable resources, of the sort that a derelict like the Joker would never even come close to having.This bothered me so much that I just couldn't enjoy the movie.I agree, though, that Ledger's performance was quite amazing. He stole the show.I thought Batman Begins was very much the better movie. I haven't yet seen ""Dark Knight Rises"" so I'm hoping it's more in the vein of the first movie than the second.",0
"It is difficult to write a bad review of a Batman movie. The franchise, started for most of us in childhood, grew to reach major movie studio treatment. That being said, the Dark Night Rises is a laughable attempt at completing the Batman story. At a very long 2 hour and 45 minutes, I eventually felt I was being held against my will. In fact, by the end, I was hoping that Metropolis would once and for all be destroyed. As luck would have it, that did not come to pass. The movie was filled with plot holes, a ridiculous villain and contrived drama. As the clock on the bomb counted down from the overused 5 seconds, a silent cheer could be heard in the audience watching with me as the end neared. The plot line, hard to call it that as it is more of a plot meander, like a slow moving stream that carves its way snaking along the unremarkable flatness of the mid-west, covers far too much territory far too glibly. The only character that was actually fun to watch was that of Anne Hathaway, and not for the most obvious of reasons. Her snide and cynical portrayal seems just right for this abomination of a film. I lack the ambition to finish this review as it makes me relive nearly three hours when I was held prisoner by The Batman!",0
"I do not understand what movie everybody seems to have been watching. ""The dark knight"" simply is not that good.I am sorry. Heath Ledger is dead. Should we just close our eyes and pretend everything he did in this film was great? I definitely do not think so. He was just re-acting Mr. Depp's pirate! While Depp was absolutely convincing in his role as Cpt. Sparrow, Ledger only copied the whole concept. That was pretty weak acting.I still do not understand why Gary Oldman plays Gordon. What a complete waste! He could be such a fantastic villain, or brilliant at every role, that has light and darkness about it. Gordon is just a straight honorable man. And you let Oldman play this!? The rest of the cast is doing pretty fine. Even though I think some of the great names are straight forward wasted on stereotype roles! So what about the story line? Does it overcome any of the above mentioned items? No way! Batman is forced to consider his actions. Is it in any way justifiable what he does? Off course not! Taking the law into your own hand is no good idea. There is historic evidence: It is very advisable to place the force into the hands of a state, that is bound to law and that is democratic justified. While it is a romantic idea to overcome the weaknesses of the state by individual actions it is in practice the end of a free society.On a comic book level batman is cool. But is there any sense in seriously considering his role? No, that's ridiculous. Our hero does not kill villains, he does not judge them. But he is bending the rules to catch them. So he is bending the rules by spying out all cell phones. Is that in fact worse than beating up presumed criminals? Worse than breaking every single piece of law in order to catch th ""evil"" ones? It is absolutely silly to have this as a theme in a batman comic-movie. Every reasonable state would HAVE to put our hero into prison. No option on that, period.The movie is pretty good, 5 out of 10 ain't to bad. But that's all!",0
"This is what happens when a good movie appears in the mainstream. People who are used to Hollywood junk stand in awe now and praise this movie as a masterpiece. Well, it is a good movie, but it has nothing to do in the TOP 10! I don't care much about that non-realistic stuff, it's a comics already, however there some flaws which keeps my rating in the middle. Joker steals the show. No doubt about that. I found myself bored between the scenes without this villain. And the second thing which lowered the score was that pathetic would-be moralistic message. People wouldn't kill others to save themselves? Am I supposed to believe in a all-of-a-sudden-kind prisoner who will make the decision (on a boat full of prisoners!) not to blow the other ship (full of of oh-so-innocent people) in the air? And vice versa? I said I didn't mind the unrealistic bits, but this was just laughable. But all in all, it was quite entertaining even though the story was somehow flat.",0
"In a word: Disappointment. For all the hype, this is a laborious movie at best. Another example of a poor sequel. The movie was a disappointing follow up to ""Batman Begins"". Christian Bale's performance was acceptable in terms of what the character of Batman/Bruce Wayne would allow in cinema. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was one-dimensional and predictable. Sorry Heath, but Jack Nicholson and even Cesar Romero (Joker from the TV series) have you beat easily. As an actor, I really don't see what all the hype is about with Heath Ledger. The choice of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel was not entertaining at all. There's just nothing there in this performance. Ms. Gyllenhaal as an actress is above average, but there wasn't much to this role. Don't blame her. Appearances by Morgan Freeman and Micheal Cain are always bonuses to any film. The one bright spot (acting wise) was the performance of Aaron Echart (Harvey Dent). Nice range. This is one film I don't need to see again. Side note: This would not be an entertaining film for kids (9rs+) at all. The gadgets and special effects were flat and most of the times flew by at such a rate of speed that you could scarce take them in. Too bad. The story and character of Batman deserves much better.",0
"The movie gets one star for Aaron Eckhart, who is the only actor to bring the film to life. The other star goes to the bat-cycle, which is the only cool device/gadget in the film. Everything else is a disappointment.Christian Bale -- Could somebody please wake him up. Heath Ledger -- ""De mortuis, nihil nisi bonum."" He avoided the snarling giggles of Nicholson and Romero and is a bit funny now and again, but I do not remember the Joker being a sado-masochist. The character remains a cartoon villain. Michael Caine -- An eighty year old butler. Pathetic. Sorry to say, but they really needed a younger man for the part. Script. -- a half decent first draft. Three or four more drafts and it might have amounted to something. With the exception of Dent, none of the characters are worth caring about. That's its major flaw. Production -- Dazzlingly cruddy. All the sets and props underwhelm. No real style is established. Cinematography -- Only one nice shot in the movie, when the Joker blows up a hospital. It is nice, but not great and only marginally memorable. Every other shot looks like a cheesy CBS crime show.I'm glad I waited until the last week of its run in the $2 movie theaters to see it. I would have hated to think I wasted $10 on this. I won't be getting the DVD. Please, do not give it to me for Christmas.I once got fired from a newspaper for giving a bad review to Tim Burton's ""Batman"". In retrospect, every ""Batman"" has been worse since then. Burton's first ""Batman"" is looking better and better all the time. I should mention that the film fails to establish meaning in its narrative. It constantly strives to do this by having the characters speak in deep voices and intone such nonsensical lines as ""If you stay around long enough, either you die a hero or end up a villain."" By saying such trite nonsense in serious tones, you don't make the movie serious, only seriously trite and nonsensical.I was bored after the first half hour and the next two hours seemed like three or four, as I hoped, in vain, the movie would become interesting.",0
"Before you well accredited film critics bash me, hear my side.Batman has always been my favorite superhero of all time. This film dumps all over what is really Batman. In fact I was worried when my idiot ex girlfriend said this movie was, ""amazing."" The girl barley even has a brain. I should know, I dated her. I'm trying to write as little as possible here but come on!1. What is Morgan Freemen doing in this movie!?!! 2. Why the hell is the mayor wearing eye liner and mascara?!?! 3. lol Batman's voice, are you serious!?! 4. No Bat cave!? It's just a large empty room. 5. Batman get's 2,000 TV's rigged up to a sonar within a day with technology he did not create Morgan freemen did. 6. The story moves along about as smooth as sandpaper. 7. The joker bitches about how people go crazy when things don't go according to plan, well this jerk comes up with like 5 flawless plans in this movie! A little far-fetched. I could go on. The joker was great I'll give it that.This movie was horrific, and I can't wait to be bashed because it will just prove that most people in this world have no clue.",0
"Much surprised this movie is so popular. It has some top level acting performances performances, but...They used CGI for Harvey Dent's mangled face instead of makeup. The result is that he looks like a zombie from a computer game and not like a real person. I don't understand that choice. Especially when they obviously have a good make up guy on board.The action scenes are lacklustre at best. There is simply no interesting fights. Some of the action are really run-of-the mill over the top stuff. Compare this to the fight scenes in a movie like The Matrix. That is a big drawback to me, because fighting is really a big part of what Batman does.It's boring the Joker uses bombs, bombs and more bombs. Normally he used gas a lot. Heath Ledger does a great job. His character is interesting, but just not not really written like the Joker. He lacks the flamboyance and humour. There's not enough comedy themed gadgets using poison and gas. Maybe they just wanted to do something different, but this take in Joker didn't work for me.I find the script messy. The overall problem is that it intriduces characters a lot, and then doesn't do much with them. The Batman-copycats just disappear from the plotline. They are just there in the beginning. There's way too many mafia people. Cut the mafia people down to a few guys and have them share all the mafia lines; this way you can better make them become real characters. The Lau character is another character that gets ""finished with"" too fast. We're never even told what happens to him?Alfred also almost disappears from the end of the movie. The Russian ballerina also needs to have a presence during the entire movie; just 2 small scenes more with her makes it feel more like she is a part of something, and not just a character that is part of a machine like plot, so she is just dumped like an unnneded cogwheel. She reacted strongly to Harvey Dent and Batman, it would make sense to say say show a soundbite interview with her on TV letting us know how she felt about the stuff that happened.Then there was a small story loop with Batman getting attacked by dogs. And the big machine they used to spy on all the phones in the city. Those two things were just boring tbh. Would much prefer Batman found the Joker in some interesting creative smart way, where you can go OO THAT WAS SO CLEVER OF BATMAN! instead of just introducing a wonder machine outta nowhere.The point with Batman beating up some SWAT-teams was really dumb. They could just call them and tell them who not to kill; they are supposed to have radios and headsets lol. Or Batman could just tell them ""hey guys, there people are not bad guys but hostages dressed up to be bad guys"", seems sort of more simply that beating the bejeesus our of them all. Especially at a point where he needs help, seems to me better to cooperate with SWATs to get the bad guys, instead of beating them up :)So yes, it's well made and directed and has good actors, but the script has too many weaknesses.",0
"The acting was superlative but I believe the story line very obnoxious in the way violence was portrayed and to treat the Aaron Eckhardt Character the way that happened was against all the natural instincts of the film and story, The plot line got confusing in many ways, but I suppose it ended up the only way it could, I was pleased with all the characters, especially Gary Oldman and of course Heath Ledger, how he performed that role will always amaze me.The many harrowing experiences need parents to monitor what their children watch and counsel them on such savagery.My 3 was not for the acting which would have earned a 10 but the violence that was allowed to pursue 80 Percent of the movie cause a right down to 3",0
Key points for my low score1. Film is 30 mins too long2. Heath Ledger is brilliant as the dark evil Joker - but it is supposed to be a comic book film - I mean who has ever heard of a man dressed as a bat - it needed lightening up. Sorry but Heath my be brilliant but Jack's joke gets my vote.3. Harvey Dent was too plastic4. Christian Bale seemed to have about three lines5. Michael Caine was earning his pension6. So was Morgan Freeman7 Some of the plot was obvious and therefore failed to cause any surprise.8. Too many plot lines9. Rachel was wooden10. It took itself too seriouslyGood Superhero Films ( so you know whether to take any notice of me)1. Batman ( with jack) 2. Superman 2 3. Blade 1 and 2Lets hope they lighten up for future films - I couldn't stand a angst Penguin,0
"I expected a lot from TDK after seeing the spectacle that was Batman Begins. Unfortunately, TDK failed in most respects - there's not a scene in the movie that makes you care about the fates of any of the characters. The characterizations are very shallow and there's no chemistry between the main characters. Simply put, the movie doesn't involve the viewer in any way.TDK is undoubtedly the darkest Batman movie made thus far and the production values are first-rate as far as it comes to editing and filming and set design. Thus, it is a pity that the story and characters fail to deliver.",0
"Well, i'm fighting a gushing torrent of positive opinion here, but i think this film is in no way anywhere near a masterpiece of cinema, the main reasons being that the plot is poor, the film is far too long and that it is also balanced far too far in favour of the villains.The movie started brilliantly with an excellent bank robbery scene, and continued with aplomb until about halfway through, when the flow of the film just stalled. The plot just stopped making sense with the joker seemingly sauntering around Gotham with face paint on and obvious facial scars doing exactly what he wanted and nobody even noticing this strange man. He would stick out like a sore thumb wouldn't he? why did batman have so much trouble finding him? At about this time in the movie i really started losing interested due to the many plot flaws and inconsistencies on top of the fact that we were about 1hr 30 minutes through the film with no ending in site.And, yes, the film is too long, and thats because the plot is too convoluted. And you couldn't cut anything out because the film would suffer even more from it. I would even imagine a lot was cut out anyway, particularly from the latter half of the film.The joker dominates the film from start to end and you would think this is a good thing because heath ledger does a great job portraying him. But its too much of a good thing - it just unbalances the film - it makes it too dark, too downbeat. I was expecting batman to come into his own in the later half of the film to balance the darkness of the first half, but he doesn't - another villain joins instead! I just think this film is vastly overrated and nowhere near as good as the original. Batman Begins was more consistent in its portrayal of the batman universe - the current batman franchise is based on a brutal realism but Dark Knight had too many flaws that undermined this, from the unrealistic plot elements to Harvey Two-Face's ridiculously over-the-top and unbelievable cgi facial damage.Lastly, the film has compromised itself by trying to pander to general cinema audiences. In the UK the film was given a 12a rating which means practically anyone can see it. So the blood and violence has been reduced. But the nasty tone of the film remains with many scenes of implied violence that are probably worse than actually seeing it. It is in fact a very violent film with many sadistic torture scenes that are in no way suitable for people under 15.Having written all this, i still thought the film was OK but in no way the masterpiece everyone thinks it is. I was expecting much more and it didn't live up to the hype for me. But once everyone calms down a bit and looks at the film again in the cold light of day, i think time will judge this as an above average action movie with a good turn from the joker that really does go on a bit too long.",0
"In my opinion, this movie has been completely over-rated by the fan-boy crowd and most critics (with the notable exception of The New Yorker's David Denby and New York's David Edelman). A sentimental, knee-jerk obligation to praise the late Heath Ledger's performance--which *does* merit all the accolades it's received--has spilled over into blind worship of the movie itself.When the dust settles, I think it will become clear that the movie is overlong, unnecessarily complex, pretentious, visually muddled at various points, and saddled with a dull-as-dirt hero who's computer modified voice is completely laughable. I mean, seriously, every time Batman tried to talk to someone with his stupid Darth-Vader voice, it jarred me right out of the movie. The Dark Knight certainly isn't Art. It's not even a particularly good blockbuster, compared to, say, the far more entertaining and coherent Iron Man or a classic like Die Hard.Ledger's achievement is astounding, but the movie around him is just not on the same level.",0
"I must admit that this movie should receive the trophy of ""Anthem of a generation"" for incredible bad movies of the new era of film making. First time I've heard of this movie was from a friend who told me and I quote ""Man, this movie is on the top of IMDb list, we have to see it"" so I did see it. I was expecting something great , but after one hour I was sick of it and left the room. It is non stop action with no script ,nothing at all.All you see and hear in this movie is bum-bum,bang-bang and not even some cliché lines, nothing artistic ,the only plots in this movie are kinder garden plots and they are tied in an anarchic structure.The only reason to look at this movie is to see special effects and CGI.Batman begins is a much better movie than this one.Christian Bale's performance was less than mediocre even if everyone praised him for reinventing the character of Batman.It brings nothing new the Batman concept, the only actor who did something was Heath Ledger (Joker). You would probably ask why is rated so high.The answer is that the marketing and the propaganda did a great job infusing in people minds the idea that this is a good movie, plus the rating of a movie it is mostly subjective and when you say that a movie costs $180 million and it has all of this presumed great actors people will say ""Gee that is a great movie"".And the critics do you think that they are honorable people who rate movies with objectivity for the good of the people, of course not they have to sell the newspapers they work for.And once i asked an American friend why do you listen to a popular band at that time and he said because it is what is cool now and what people listen, i don't agree with him so when you rate a movie listen to your inner self not others.",0
I'll try to keep this brief. Here's what I want all of you die-hard Nolan Batman fans and comic book geeks to try to imagine: Imagine that Heath Ledger wasn't wearing clown makeup and that Christian Bale wasn't wearing a bat costume. Then try imagining if this movie wasn't based on your beloved superhero.Would any of you still think it was a good movie or that it was even remotely well acted? Would it really rank #4 on IMDb greatest movies of all time?,0
"Humm!I saw this film before Batman begins and possibly it has better special effects (I have only seen the first one it bits), but, and it's a big but; This film is very much a perfect example of what is wrong with contemporary cinema - it's garbage.Truly appreciate the quality of Tim Burton's Batman by first watching this cart of steaming plops!You might be the kind of person that doesn't give a fig about what you watch. Or you just want to see pure spectacle. This film has spectacle and then more spectacle and then just as you are trying to follow what happened, and possibly work out that the film is not that great, something else will happen.End result is a kind of mood, average at that, rather than any cohesive enjoyment. In fact it is probably a bit worse than that even tawdry.",0
"When you watched that movie called Shawshank redemption it shocked your very foundations on all levels, and may even have changed the course of your life if even for a few moments. Batman is an amazing movie. Yes it is fun and exciting,,,,,But is the rating that is higher than Shawshank or The Godfather a reality in any mine except for the Warner Brothers executives who keep pressing 10 as a rating for Batman or the 14 year old faggy boys who still can't wack off without waking up the dead normal..? Please you wanks,,,,Show some Balls even if they are not hairy and take back those 10's and make them 8's and Kharma will go back to ya brothers... Peace out.",0
"Shot well but with a plot so full of holes it was hard to enjoy it and not get annoyed. How exactly DID the joker manage to fill buildings and passenger ferries up with drums of diesel and explosives without anyone knowing?? AND why did Bruce Wayne's voice change every time he put on the Bat Suit?? etc etc Very annoying. (Although it seems as if I'm the only one who didn;t enjoy it!!) When they smashed the Batman search light with an axe WHY did they have it plugged in and switched on???) Joker escapes from custody too many times and after a while it just gets irritating. The movie is also too long and each time you think the story is coming to a conclusion it goes off on another tack... you've guessed, the Joker escapes and starts on another mission of pointless mayhem.",0
"This movie was: 1. Way too long. 2. Way way too long. 3. Tried to do too much. 4. Made me believe that Jake Gyllenhall is a more believable love interest than his sister. Sorry , she's just very plain looking and a mediocre actress at best. 5. Lost the dialog in an overwhelming music score. 6. Had a horrible script. 7. Ledger is the best thing about the film - but no one could live up to the hype. Sadly he will not be able to reprise this role. 8. Put every good scene in the trailers and fooled everyone by doing so. 9.The people who made this knew it is a stinker and sold it hard on the Net. 10. Had an over and over and over feel to it - I started looking at my watch about 45 minutes into the movie and about every 10 minutes thereafter. I thought it would never end and then the ending was blah.I have read stuff here about Maggie Gyllenhall being a BETTER actress that Katie Holmes. Well she may be but Katie Holmes was much more believable than she was in the role. She was unwatchable. She ruined the movie for me because no one could believe that she was being fought over by two handsome men. I almost puked when the Joker says ""Hello Beautiful"", and some one in the theater actually called out ""She's a beast !"".The first movie was great. This one , just really disappointing.Go see it. I won't have such high expectations again.The honest vote should be a 5 - but I lowered it to account for the deluded and blind.",0
"Of course this film sadly had extra weight attached to it as it features one of the last performances (and what a performance it is) from Heath Ledger.Other than that this is an above average superhero film, that again adds new depth to the Batman mythology.It's very, very dark at times, and it made me somehow miss the lighter Batman films of the 90's, but its quality as a film can't be denied.",0
"I don't understand the love for this film. There are better Batman films in existence. The cartoon from the 90's was better than this film. (then again, how do you top that masterpiece?) 1. Christian Bale was hilarious.When you make you voice as deep as possible, it's pretty hard to take you seriously. Kevin Conroy (Batman from the cartoon) had found a perfect balance between intimidating and realistic for his voice for Batman. But Christian Bale? He's completely laughable when he's yelling at the Joker during the interrogation scene. He also did this weird thing with his lips where he forced them to stick out as much as possible. My point is, Batman is supposed o be intimidating ad awesome, but Bale tried to so hard to do just that he failed on a massive level.2. Heath Ledger was not that good. At least in person.The only points in the film where Ledger as the Joker was intimidating was in the scenes where he was film something on a camcorder. Those scenes were great. In every other scene, though, he's cheesy and stupid. That thing he does where he runs his fingers through hair and likes his lips? How can I look at that and say that was scary? Mark Hamill (Joker in the cartoon) was the perfect joker. All of his mannerisms and his speech patterns were what you'd expect form a psychopathic clown. In this film, he's just a psychopath.3. Stupid decisions.Why did nobody on the police department go to save Rachael while Batman was going after Harvey Dent? Why did the police let the Joker out of his cell ""to make a phone call?"" You'd think they'd have reason to keep him in the cell, maybe even in a straitjacket. Why did that police officer get in a fight with the Joker? The movie would have ended right if the Police Department wasn't full of morons. Why did Batman never kill the Joker? I'm pretty sure if you asked anyone else, they would say they'd be willing to if it would save hundreds of people. Batman just has this stupid moral code that keeps him from seeing the broader picture (I have the same issue with the comics and the cartoon) All-in-all, a lot of idiots making stupid decisions.4. Everything else was okay.The soundtrack was decent. The action scenes were decent. Everything else was just fine. But laughable acting, stupid plot conveniences, and so-so everything else is good enough to get #4 on the best films ever made? No. This movie is overwhelmingly under-average.4/10",0
"So this is the second installment of Christopher Nolan's trilogy and it carries on the tradition of being too long, too gadget central, too many subplots and villains..and most damningly it's too hyped up and unable to deliver.The special effect are what these films hang as much on as the acting l and they are indeed spectacular...Well most of them are spectacular...Well some...Well so many are not only plainly absurd but incomprehensible such as the 'wall of phones' whose sole reason to be considered as a good idea was likely because it would appear so impressive when finalised on screen - oh how wrong they were as it was a mess of fast paced blurry images further confused by rapid camera pans and fast zooms.Some have disliked this more modern darker Batmam but i feel it works so much better considering the industrialist metropolis the films are supposed to take place in. It works well and is a major saving grace - so why they took the story out of its home turf for the first time for a scene didn't really make sense, nor did kt add anything other than a seeming pointless 'you cant escape me' scene.(hardly a new one for Batman!)So eventually you have to mention Heath Ledgers Joker, who's entrance to the story is contradictory to what follows as he robs a bank before later on denigrating those who do such things for money (burning his own literally warehouse sized pile of loot in the process). He also makes a habit of killing his cohorts, yet oddly is never short of company when required for a job. Surely anyone worth hiring is also wise enough to avoid taking the job.I find Ledger performance annoying, and at times bizarre. He supposedly spent 6 weeks alone in a hotel room perfecting the role? What on earth did he do in that time because it wasn't acting lessons. Supposedly he developed the characters idiosyncrasies and 'made them his own'. All I see is a whiney, lip licking fool with grandiose plans that really should not have a hope of succeeding even within the confines of movie land.Yet succeed they do as obviously in Gotham city its easy to sneak in to hospitals, lay dozens of explosive charges in order to blow the place up room by room, and all while wondering around with a white painted face that no one ever questions. If you wish to avoid the surveillance state then Gotham's the place to live it seems as only Batman himself has any success monitoring and preventing crime whilst everyone else couldn't spot wrongdoing or spy on people even if the subject had a big scary clown smile, white face makeup, frizzy hair, purple suits, and a whole whost of other personal and social pointers to his myriad of psychological and sociological problems.Fear not though as Joker is not alone. TwoFace is a pointless addition to the plot and adds nothing. Maybe he could have been a worthy villain in the future but we now know that won't be happening.Batman himself...well fine except that raspy signature voice is as annoying as Jokers wet lipped squeakiness.Morgan Freeman, so often a stalwart of great films, was a nothing character. His drive and motivation of Batman's technical side was limp and he felt like he was running on flat batteries.Pointless me going through an A-Z of all the film moments and character, good and bad, a I reckon most people will see this as either a Magnificent 10, or a Terrible 1 and many others will have listed a myriad of both positive and negative arguments in support or damnation of the film... So my final roundup is this.Its not a terrible film, but its far from the classic some make out, and I suspect some fanboys will never downgrade a film from a 10 if based on their favourite comic.I found too many faults and was too irritated to care about some characters including primary ones. Also far too long and I failed to react to any last second twist of big bang finale thus most definitely not leave me hanging on for more.5/10...wanted more but in less time. Alas it didn't arrive even when running late in to the night.",0
"Nolan is a filmmaker who actually never cared for mimetic, emotional and ethical honesty, and it seems that for the last couple of years with every new movie he's been sinking deeper into pure escapism - a tendency culminating in ""Inception"", an epitome of what might be called postmodern pseudo-art-for-pseudo-art's-sake.Nolan's works are known to be structurally sophisticated. The question is : Who needs another structurally sophisticated action strip masquerading as a cinematic essay on human nature, ethics, philosophy ... ? Many of us seem to do, judging by this site's reviews. In the end, we get what we deserve, thanks to Mr. Nolan, who is the real Joker here, playing a cat-and-mouse game with audience all over the world. Although there's at least one crucial difference between him and his character : he wouldn't burn the stack of money that ""The Dark Knight"" earned him.",0
"Compared to the original movie:1) No Batman movie can beat the original Batman (1989). 2) There's not even a Batwing and Batmobile. 3) Heath Ledger did a very good dark version of the Joker, but unfortunately there is no better Joker than Jack Nicholson. 4) Danny Elfman could not do a better job making the soundtrack. 5) The 1989 Batman ""Main Theme"" has an unforgettable, recognizable classic. 6) Christian Bale's voice as Batman is always grumbling, which just sounds horrible every time he speaks. 7) Christian Bale's head wearing the Batman mask does not even fit him, looking ridiculous which he fails in the role of Batman. 8) Original Batmobile is a classic car. Vehicles used in The Dark Knight? Enormous large sized wheels under an ugly armored piece of steel. 9) No Batcave. 10) Christopher Nolan, you're out of order with these modern Batman film series.1 out of 10 for The Dark Knight (2008)",0
"The Dark Knight is a good action movie that features tightly crafted action sequences and it boasts a decent story to tie it all together. Sadly though the story is still drawn out like all comic book movies. The acting also is very bland with only Heath Ledger, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine performing well.The direction is solid and Nolan has learned from his mistakes in Batman Begins. To say the least though, the film needed a better editor as the film kind of drags on past it's expiry date. For a movie this long it needed a really good story but it lacked it and the ending is terrible. Overall though it's a good film, just not one of the best of 2008. It'll be a fun movie to see for a night but the Dark Knight won't have you looking back on it as a classic.",0
"Don't believe the hype. Not good at all. Focuses too much on the joker.Batman is supposed to be a hero. The old Batman movie with Nicholson is a much more satisfying movie. Watch this only if you are 12-15 years old. And what is with the darkness? Batman isn't supposed to be like this. It is like they took the worst of the 90s comics and made this movie out of it. And I bet that there are a lot of you saying ""but it made all that money!"" So what? That doesn't mean it is a great movie. Wait a few years. The Micheal Keaton Batman will still be around. This movie won't. The acting is mediocre. The action is OK, but it focuses too much on the evil side. Watch Iron Man or something if you want a super hero movie from this year. I give it a 1/10",0
I gave this movie a one (1). Not that it deserved it. But what it doesn't deserve is the lofty 9 from IMDb viewers that put it #4 on the IMDb list. The movie is good but it is not great. So I give it a one just to balance all the ludicrous 10's.What was good. Well Heath Ledger as the Joker was the most obvious. Unpredictable but never over the top. A scary Joker - Jack Nicholson - who? Aaron Eckhart was also quite good as Harvey Dent/Two Face. And finally Christian Bale was a good Batman the best of the bunch. Didn't feel like a hero at all. Oldman was good as he always is. Finally Maggy held her own. So I had no complaint about the acting. I just found the story jumpy and confusing at time. Christopher Nolan is a good director but his stories get lost amongst all the gimmicks. And that is just annoying.I hadn't seen this picture before nor the other Nolan Batman's either. And now I know why. No not really a bad picture. Just not worthy of a 10 or the overall 9 rating let alone a top 250 IMDb. Not that my one is going to make any difference .,0
"If this was just another action film with science fiction / comic book plot, it would have been adequate. It had the usual sequences of fights, explosions and just general mayhem.The problem is that this film comes with an incredible amount of hype and one is kind of expecting it to deliver something really special. In this it fails. Oh, at 2 hr 32 minutes, it is also way too long.Most of the critical praise goes to Heath Ledger's Joker and rightly so. He is by far the best performance in the film. He still does not compare to chilling performance given by Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"".Bale's Batman is very disappointing. He comes across more like James Bond than Batman. Batman is a very dark character who is not that different from the people that he fights. For him the fight is personal. This does not come across in the film.Probably my main complaint is the length and the pacing. The film is filled with many fast-paced action scenes but lacks progression. The story-telling does not take one on a journey as it should but rather one feels that the last fight scene or the last explosion is pretty much like the last one.At 100-120 minutes, this would be a adequate forgettable film and I guess that I am penalising it more for the hype than anything else. It is, however, nowhere close to the really good films out there.",0
"I could not believe what was on the screen. I fell asleep twice because it was boring. I looked up IMDb.com to see the ""memorable quotes""...all the quotes listed are boring and trite. Then I looked up the ""user comments"" and then I screened the comments to see the most negative, which are listed under the category ""Hated it."" I agreed with them all. Here are a few headlines from them in order: ""Mediocre."" ""Convoluted farce."" ""The Dark Nothing."" ""The Dark Knight is overrated."" ""Falls short of greatness."" ""This movie is the proof that the world is becoming a sick and dumb place."" ""Are you nuts?"" ""The jokes on us."" ""Too much of everything."" ""Had to do it..."" ""Best film ever? AHAHAHAHAHA.""

""what happened?"" ""Absolutely not dark. Hardly Batman-like."" ""This movie was a joke..."" I agree with all of these headlines. It is unbelievable to me that everyone is going crazy over this film. ""Batman Begins"" was far better. Save your money.",0
"This movie was so so. The Joker was played by Heath Ledger who died in real life afterwords. But what most movie buffs wonder is why was the joker so powerful? He was beaten in the face by The Batman repeatedly but never really was hurt. I would think that so many punches in the face would result in a major injury. That was very strange. Also, what happened to the joker to make him that way? Jack Nicholson's Joker was made that way when he went to a plastic surgeon or something like that and had botched dental procedure. This joker gargled with razor blades and everything was somehow related to how he was beat by his Mom. I can't understand why The Batman hated the Joker so much.",0
"I don't mind comics in general as they provide great base for special effects. That's what i went there for, i haven't seen a SINGLE special effect that could make remember the movie. Only the truck comes to mind, but come on it's so below average that's not even worth mentioning. Hrm, the two-face that was just a snort, his eye reminded me of an Army of darkness, it made me smile somewhere deep in my subconsciousness.The Joker that was so terribly overdone, lip licking and smacking could fit couple times, but watch his tongue every time he stops speaking is an overdose. Definitely he's the highlight of the movie, but damn it, i like the amount of evil and craziness he's delivering, but not when it verges with disgust to a physical appearance. Luckily we didn't get to his dirty underwear.And, oh well, the movie is extremely grave, there wasn't a SINGLE joke to cheer up the people, all attempts at black humor failed as they were already beaten to death somewhere else. And the language used is extremely pale and primitive.3/10, just a waste of my time, should've worked instead.",0
"Why The Dark Knight sucks:It is basically akin to Triumph of the Will; pure propaganda. Batman = George W. Bush (or any shady, uber-rich government official). As Bruce Wayne, he must portray himself as a spoiled, bumbling fool, who boozes and womanizes and is just a big walking joke. As Batman, he can use any kind of destructive method to take down the bad guy (in this case, the Joker is often called a terrorist), including using billions of dollars of Wayne Enterprises money to secretly implant 3D-sonar-imaging devices into a wave of new cell phones that flood the market and consequently give him the ability to create a 3D map of the city that can locate and track anyone. His closest friends, who know his secret identity, think this tracking map is unethical, but he justifies it by saying that he must use any means necessary to take this one down. Does any of this sound familiar? Besides all of this, the movie feels like that 15-minute montage of super-heroic feats from every FIRST superhero movie... sssssssssttttttttttrrrrrrrreeeeeeettttttccccchhhhhheeeeedddddd ooooouuuuuutttttt to 2 1/2 hours! It starts out too talky with a bunch of mob bosses (among them Eric Roberts) wriggling out from under D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in court and throws a few unnecessary story lines up in the air (that don't get resolved until much later... and poorly at that), then strings together action set-pieces (that all seem like leftovers from a Die Hard movie) for the next 2 hours, then finally wraps it up with characteristically cheesy ""the fight will continue"" dialogue that every superhero movie ends with. So it's boring, PLUS it's poorly done apart from that. SAVE YOUR MONEY!",0
"So here we are a month after this films release and we're still talking about it. Actually by talking about it i mean it's jaw dropping box office performance and recently ranked best film of all time on IMDb. Thankfully as of today it has dropped from #1 to 3 and probably will keep dropping. Let me get this off my chest i thing it's a good movie not a great one and it sure as hell is not a masterpiece or even the greatest comic book movie of all time that dubious honor belongs to the Fantastic Four followed closely behind by the first Spider-Man. I know this to many is blasphemy so crucify me fellow comic book fans but this is what i truly believe. My main problems with The Dark Knight stem with the fact that it's way to friggin long, is a little hard to follow, and at times felt rushed with scenes either missing or suddenly appearing with no flow to them. For instance (one of the awkward scenes i'm talking about occurs at the beginning) after the joker puts his calling card on the table next to Gotham's most notorious mobsters while they have their therapy session meetings (as the Joker puts them) in a anonymous kitchen. The moment the joker bolts out the kitchen's swaying doors suddenly we're treated to a scene with Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes sitting at a table having dinner in an expensive restaurant. This may not seem as bad in my review but trust me in the movie it's really awkward like there's no built up to it it just shows up. one of other problems i have with this movie is the way scenes seem to go on forever just to have the film run two and a half hours where they could have been resolved much faster or cut out entirely. (Spoilers)Example: The ferry scene. Toward the end The joker has 2 ferries rigged with explosives one carrying innocent civilians the other convicted felons and convicts (One of the convicts happens to be played by Tommy Tiny Lister Jr. from Friday and The Fifth Element). The reason their on the ferries is because the joker has threatened to level gotham and cause chaos and anarchy in the city. Gotham officials order the people be evacuated some choose the ferries. The joker puts one detonator on each boat and plays a game with his victims he tells them that at the strike of midnight one will decide whose lives are worth living more the civilians or the convicts. Than when midnight hits whoever puts the detonator together the fastest lives and in the process blows up the other ferry killing everyone on board. However, in the end everything gets resolved by Tommy Tiny Lister Jr. simply throwing his ferries detonator thru a window into the water and turning to his superior and rightfully proclaiming ""You should have done this a long time ago"".My words exactly had Tommy Tiny been the one to decide the fate of everyone on the two ferries instead of the warden who was stupid enough to believe that the ferries were rigged the scene would have lasted mere seconds cause he would have known that the whole thing was a charade. Cause convicts know when they're being played. So this lengthy scene for nothing had one character gotten control of the situation. The movie would have ended 15 minuted earlier.My big last complaint against this movie is the way it treats two of Batman's other villains. (Spoilers)Scarecrow is horrificly underused in this movie to the point where it's anti-climatic. Scarecrow appears for about 2 minutes in the beginning as a drug dealer selling his hallucinogen drug in a parking garage only to be ambushed by fake batmen and then batman himself before he's tied by batman and left in the garage probably to be used again in the next movie. We never find out his fate whether he's arrested or put in arkham asylum. Then to top it all off Cillian Murphy himself who plays Scarecrow only says one line in his deep raspy voice (a mere three words) while the rest of his dialogue sounds like willem dafoe crossed with a young child. Talk about weird.(Big Spoiler) However, the greatest sin this film commits is the killing off of Two-Face. Yes, people two face dies in this movie. i thought he was being built up for another movie but i guess that was beneath Chris Nolan so he kills him off. The problem with his death is it's so damn weak he simply falls over a ledge with Batman after holding Jim Gordon's family hostage and breaks his back. What a waste of an iconic villain. Why aren't more comic book fans upset about this? Way to forgiving.I know i'm making this review sound like i hate it i don't i'm just pointing out it's hugely glaring flaws that everyone seems to be looking over.The good things about the movie are a great performance by Heath Ledger (tragic what happened to him) Great chase/ambush scene with armored trucks, helicopters, the batpod, eighteen wheelers, and police cars all vying to get harvey dent who's being transported to prison, and a couple of well timed out of left field plot twists.So overall good to watch once but more of an experience than an entertainment.",0
"I deemed it expedient to review the movie, ""The Dark Knight"" due to the positive reviews and acclamations it has unduly received. In actuality ""The Dark Knight"", henceforth to be referred to as TDK, is a trite manifestation of mediocrity that is cataclysmic in proportion. A cinematic travesty; it is the embodiment of mass-produced, assembly-line, manufactured and uncreative pop-cinema that dominates the modern box office. **SPOILER ALERT**.For most of the cast of TDK, the acting was obviously and embarrassingly far below par. Never before in such a high-budget, hyper-over-hyped cinematic enterprise has there been such drab and boring under acting. Christian Bale seemed bored to even be in the movie as if he was waiting to get home to beat his mother. Perhaps he needed someone to tell him how to move his cheeks, lips, eyes brows, and other facial features in order to portray Bruce Wayne. His voice acting is much worse than his facial expressions as he refuses to change its tone or pitch except when he is rasping in an utterly fractious way to disguise his voice when he is in his Batsuit ( this is not often since for a movie about Batman, the character makes surprisingly few appearances ). Christian Bale earns himself a sub review of 0/10 for his portrayal of Bruce Wayne.Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting Rachel Dawes was no better than Christian Bale's, however, as she did not have an annoying rasping ""batvoice"" I would have given her a better rating. Except that her looks, which fall well within the category of ugly, points towards a poor casting decision. It would have been worthwhile to sacrifice acting ability for attractiveness in this case. Movies are venues for good looking performers to showcase certain interesting performances and not for ugly people to attempt vainly to perform at all.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain The Joker is the only boon in the otherwise atrocious acting of the film. He is certainly the only actor in TDK that took it upon himself to give a performance. He does a fine job as a menacing and maniacal, albeit, formulaic and predictable villain. His voice as The Joker is much less annoying than the batvoice of Bale. Heath Ledger went as far as he could with the character within the bounds of the contemptible screenplay.TDK has several action scenes. And while some these are intense and somewhat exciting there is nothing unique or particularly breathtaking about them and for the most part they are very manufactured and bland. It is possible that Christian Bale was filmed in a batman suit punching air in front of a green screen for 30 seconds and reused and looped the footage of this for every fighting scene. Batman punches the same generic henchmen (or hostages dressed as henchmen) in almost every scene. He is attacked by dogs TWICE (The capitalization will be explained fully in the next section). The car chase scene halfway through the movie when The Joker attacks the convoy carrying lawyer Harvey Dent was reminiscent of shots from Mad Max over 20 years ago except that everything was dark and covered in shadows. Instead of making things more dramatic and horrifying this just made it hard to see what was happening. Some scenes were entertaining, like the helicopter crashing into the ground (See: Die Hard 4.0 ) and the semi truck flipping (See: The Matrix Reloaded ). The action scenes were well-made, but unoriginal and similar to the action seen too often in recent movies and will hence earn an average rating.One issue that plagues TDK is that some of the more exciting things happened twice and hence one is able to see their flaws and blemishes and be annoyed rather than entertained. For instance Batman is in Hong Kong and crashes through a window to break into a building and kidnap a businessman. Then, later, he crashes through a window to fight The Joker. Batman is also attacked by dogs two times, Gets T-Boned in his ""Batmobile"" by a rocket, and then in his Ferrari by another vehicle. The untalented writers must have run out of ideas half-way through the movie and decided to recycle all of their previous ideas.The screenplay is uncreative, unoriginal, and cliché. From the start of TDK the tone is set to be dark and foreboding. Initially this works, but as the movie lingers on, the darkness becomes boring and the tone becomes more and more annoying. The chaos becomes predictable. Every scene was shot only in shades of gray; the movie could have been shot in black and white and nothing would be missed. The only occasion that primary colors make an appearance is when something explodes. The lines are cliché, but not so much that they add a humorous element and many seem like they are trying to make the audience feel intelligent. Examples of this are quotes such as ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" Any line such as this is easily made, for instance ""It never bodes well for a movie that tries so hard to be foreboding"", and as such no quotes really leave a lasting impression. There is a palpable feeling within the movie that the movie ITSELF is trying to be good, but, ultimately fails to achieve this task. TDK takes itself much too seriously.Things that were done well include the CGI on Two-Face which adds some color to the otherwise gray Gotham City and whose goofy looking eye can wrench a guffaw out of the most stoic and humorless amongst the audience. The scene where Batman was on his motorcycle was also entertaining and much more creative than most other action scenes in TDK.Suffering from a poor screenplay, statuesque acting, and mediocre and bland action scenes, ""The Dark Knight"" will receive an overall score of 3/10.",0
"This movie is incredibly overrated on IMDb. Top five film of all time? What are people thinking. Half the movie was action & chase scenes. If you agree, please register and vote this out of the top 10.I agree it was an entertaining film. But is it one film students will be watching in 5 years? Is it one you'd watch 10 times? I mean, it currently outranks Pulp Fiction, Empire Strikes Back, Goodfellas, etc. It should be at least 100 rankings below where it is now.When I look at the top 50, this movie sticks out like a sore thumb as not belonging. Yes Ledger gave a stellar performance. Maybe even Oscar worthy. But a ""top 5 movie ever"" performance?",0
"Well...First of all ,the whole story and plot got nothing to do with the original comic-book story (which already makes it even more unauthentic and unwatchable then it already is...). The Joker basically had some help killing the mobsters of Gotham City along with other 'freaks' /Batman's foes like him -like Two Face ,Poison Ivy etc').Second ,the movie changed the whole atmosphere and story into a shallow script with too much special effects and CGI not mentioning big stunts and the same predictable and uninspired below mediocre kind of plot common to most action movies and comic-based movies these days.And besides ,the acting and direction were just bad and some characters seemed not convincing and stupid not mentioning the way the writers changed some important /key characters like the Joker (Heath Ledger was just weird...he didn't fit to the Joker's role). In conclusion : a complete waste of time including your brain cells ,an endless and unwatchable crapfest--an overrated and over-hyped lame knight who is not a gentleman ,nor a good movie or a good comic book adaption.",0
"I went to see the advanced screening of The Dark Knight on IMAX. My first IMAX experience and boy was I blown away - the screen is HUGE. The main reason I hated this film can be summed up in one word - Batman. I hate Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman. He's plain awful, sorry but that's my personal opinion. Bale is stiff, lifeless and even worst lacks charisma, regardless of whether he's playing Bruce Wayne or Batman. He's so disconnected emotionally that as an audience member I didn't care what happened with him. Heath's Joker knows how to grab you straight away and demand your full attention. While Heath's performance is stellar it does lack the wit and humor you'd expect from the Joker. Whereas Jack Nicholas brought us the fun, over-the-top, magically devious Joker; Heather brings us the sad, dark, and pitiful side of the character. He plays it well, so well in fact, that it becomes a complete downer as you pull into the final minutes of this 2.5 hour non-stop shoot 'em up, throw 'em down, car chase, mob flick. It's beyond me how this movie was able to secure a PG-13 rating when it truly deserves a D rating. D for dark, dreadful, depressing, deep, and distressing. This film takes itself so seriously it's nauseating. It's a superhero movie with zero heart, where even the so-called good guy turns bad in the end. And Batman usually has beautiful love interests. The love interest being played by Maggie Gyllenhaal was simply bad casting. While she's a great actress she lacks any sex appeal and doesn't light up the screen as past women have in the Batman series - counting both film and TV, which says a lot. If only the director could have found a way to inject some LIGHT into Dark Knight I would be able to call this a masterpiece, but alas it's more of a bad nightmare.",0
"I really hate reviews where people write about how much they hate some movies. But I found this movie so annoying that I'm really surprised why did people like it. So I'll just try to explain why I didn't like it. 1.This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. I never liked Batman movies, but this is the worst one. I watched it just because my friend told me it was good. But I didn't enjoy it I nearly fell asleep. 2. The movie doesn't have any sense it's stupid. I don't get the idea..It's flat 3. The characters are so annoying. There is no likable character in this movie. All of them are boring. I have to admit that Heath Ledger was great, but there is nothing else I liked in this movie. It's just my opinion maybe I just didn't get something..",0
"One of the worst films I have ever seen. I nearly fell asleep during the movie due to lack of a compelling story. A big budget film at it's worst that was hyped beyond measure due to the appearance of a certain actor. Yes some of the special affects and costumes are excellent like they are in all Batman movies. The car was embarrassingly poor however and Christian Bale's acting was non existent who's voice was simply peculiar.Hands down worst Batman to date. Well done Hollywood hype machine for scoring another hit with a useless film, I have great respect with how much money they have made with so, so, so little. How this film has won Oscars is a myth and probably just a sympathy vote, including the high rating on this website. Avoid like the plague.",0
"Thith movie thuck. Bale's performance thuck. He is like the cardboard - dry. Ledger's Joker is there for eye candy, nothing ingenious, because who of us doesn't have an inner arse-hole to unleash? Thith movie thuck. Michael Caine flies through thith movie because he knows it thuck. As does Morbid Freeman. Maggie Gylenhorse thuck. I don't like that. Gary Oldman does. Hot fudge on a cool Saturday sells for less than 185 million dollars that this movie was made for. Thith movie made over 1 billion dollars worldwide. How many rabid dogs can that cure? Ledger's Joker is there for eye-candy, nothing invaluable, because who among us doesn't have an inner arse-hole to be unleashed?",0
"I believe this movie is ""good"" because of Heath Ledger. His performance was outstanding! This movie isn't remarkable, Heath as ""The Joker"" is! Bale is really bad, sorry but he is! and has an annoying voice. I remember once i was watching ""equilibrium"", and this was my face: ¬¬"" so as TDK... i wanted to get out of the place, but I'd paid to see it!It's really sad to see this movie ranked on #5, leaving spectacular ones behind like ""The Lord of The Rings"". I remember when i watched LOTR for the very first time, i was speechless. It's the BEST movie ever of course! and i cried at the end of Return of the King, well... who doesn't? I don't know if is OK for me to say this but... i believe TDK succeed because of Heath's death. The media overwhelmed him, and his last completed movie in so many levels. But he ended his carrier as an actor in a perfect way ;D",0
"I really can't understand why everyone is calling this things like ""the best movie ever"" ""the best comic book movie ever"" etc...This movie was mediocre. I can only figure that people are giving rave reviews because of Heath Ledger's untimely death. It's the same thing that happened when Kurt Kobain died. While I agree that it is tragic that Ledger passed away, that doesn't make him the greatest actor of all time. Nor does it make his performance in this movie better than it was. Ledger's Joker was O.K. I found his mannerisms distracting and annoying. He didn't bring all this dimension to the character like everyone is saying because the Joker is a one-dimensional villain. I don't really understand what's so exciting about it, or deep, or dark, or revolutionary. Christian Bale's weird voice thing was ridiculous, distracting, and obnoxious. The plot was honestly, kind of boring. My boyfriend fell asleep and he is a total comic book nerd.The Dark Knight has a 9.5 out of 10 rating on IMDb. Sin City has an 8.4 out of 10. That's completely insane. Sin City was a phenomenal comic book movie. The Dark Knight is not even worth seeing in the theater. Don't let all the hype fool you. Think for yourself and form your own opinion.",0
"""Here's your new batsuit, Batman. Should protect you against the most vicious dog! Oh ... on the downside, it is just a leee-tle bit less bulletproof..."" After about two hours I just wanted this film to be over. Heath Ledger was brilliant, though. No wonder Christian Bale looked cross all the time, he was out-acted in his own film. TDK lacked any real style and humour. The plot was unnecessarily complicated without really going anywhere or saying anything. The film flirted with concepts like evil, violence, morality, etc. but never got to grips with them. If there were any ideas, at times they came dangerously close to right-wing ones, but that may have been accidental. Actually not the best film of all time. Maybe people who thought this film was great are too young to have seen The Godfather, Seven Samurai, On the Waterfront, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, etc. Check out some REAL classics. And, for that reason, I'm out.",0
"This movie is just as expected with the action scenes. they are great! Although it has a bunch of politically correct one liner's, it still is very entertaining. It's over 2 hours long. I was hoping nothing would annoy me from this movie like in Spiderman 3 every time he turned ""emo"". But sadly i have to say when Batman opened his mouth and he sounded as if he had Throat Cancer.. my boyfriend and my friends we all looked at each other hoping it was just for that scene. We said ""omg he better not do that voice the whole movie because that will get so irritating"" of course then he appears as Bruce Wayne and he's back to normal... but once that Batman suit was on again.. it was back to Grizzly bear/lion/serial killer/doberman/enphycema patient's voice... I think i was disappointed because everyone told me it was so great so my expectations were high. Go with no expectations and you will enjoy it. It wasn't as great as the Michael Keaton Batman's. Gotham City looked like LA, and there was no blood on any of the violent scenes, i know its PG 13 but they should still show blood when someone gets killed. What was the point of the scarecrow showing only for a few seconds? Oh and doesn't Batman only date hot chicks? sorry but Maggie Gyllenhaal was not the cutest actress for the part. Anyways because of his annoying voice i will not buy this movie.. end of story.",0
"Really, a very unpleasant film. There's nothing but climax after climax ... no down time, no comic relief, per se. It's not that Heath Ledger didn't do a swell job; he did. But a movie that's nearly three hours long, which forces the viewer to spend most of his or her time squirming in their seat, is not, in my opinion, a very good movie. To give one example: it's said that Christian Bale studied a martial arts discipline in order to portray his fight scenes accurately. And yet, when those scenes are unspooled, they are shot in such close quarters, so fast and in such darkness, that it's difficult to determine what, exactly, is happening. Who cares? It's hyper-kinetics for its own sake. There are swell action scenes, but what about the relationship between the characters? Their development? Who cares? There's no time in this non-stop hyper-noir potboiler for any such softer sentiments. No time ... in a three-hour film? Nerts.",0
"I'm sorry but I'm not being paid to write these reviews and it sure looks like those ahead of me are. Did we see the same picture? I thought it was too long, confusing, poor plot line, very very dark, a lot of gratuitous violence and Ledger's performance was just not Oscar material as so many are proclaiming. During the movie several people got up and left. There were a couple of times there my date and I thought about leaving but we paid premium bucks to see the thing and you hate wasting money like that.The film gets off to a pretty good start. We were all excited but as it went along it began to drag. Ledger looks awful and they relied enitrely on makeup (with no prosthetics they way they did with Nicholson) to give you the impression of a smiling joker. Here it was just white and red makeup piled on the way a six-year old might do after getting into mommy's makeup. And dark. Everything was so dark throughout the film that each time someone opened a flip phone it was as bright as a flashlight! (I thought, surely they aren't going to call anyone but because so many were doing it I figured they were looking at the time - a sure sign that the film was lumbering along.)From this viewer's perspective I thought it was awful.",0
"This movie was much too long and much too boring for me to enjoy. The action scenes were very sloppy, almost like a bad sci fi channel movie. Two face seemed like a throw away character and was really useless. The movies theme seemed to be ""Batman can't stop crime and is the reason Gotham is in misery"" which seemed odd to me. Hard to believe that so many plot holes made it into the movie. Lazy screenplay and lazy directing.Christopher Nolan's style of film making seems to be slap one scene after another together without making a coherent story. Honestly had to check the end credits to see if Michael Bay directed this movie.Heath Ledger was amazing.",0
"I'm at awe of how highly rated this movie is. Honestly, I feel bad even giving it a five. This is coming from a comic, movie and Batman buff.*spoilers begin* The Joker was awesome. However I got a more sadistic feeling from him rather than laughy jokey. His jokes weren't all too funny. However, I still enjoyed his character. Action could be OK. Sometimes it was poorly done though. Same goes for the acting..This movie was way to long and was very scattered. I'm still wondering what the Scarecrow was doing in the movie at all. Also the eyeliner and mascara of the mayor... There were a lot of pointless added things. As mentioned before, the city didn't have a very Gotham look or feel.This movie focused a lot on the cops. I don't mind cop thrillers and such but I went to see Batman vs. The Joker...not the life and times of all of Gotham City.They should have waited to give Two-Face his own movie. As mentioned before if he really wanted revenge he'd kill the Joker not take the cop's family hostage and threaten to kill the son as payback.One thing that really bothered me though...they have all these videos of the Joker making obvious threats to kill people until Batman unmasks himself...they catch the Joker and ""Oh no we can't do anything but hold him until morning because we have nothing on him."" Then when the Joker has a cop hostage, they don't shoot him. Instead they give him the cell phone so he can trigger a bomb inside some guy's stomach. That with the boat scene...As if they'd really wait it out. It did kind of make me smile when the one convict threw the detonator out the window. There were multiple plot holes and this movie probably could have been cut in half. The ending was rather cliché and blah. I definitely enjoyed some scenes...but I'd often find myself wondering when it would end. It's doubtful I'd watch this movie again..aside from wanting to see the Joker.",0
"Gave this a 5 just because it is just a yawner.The only good thing this movie did for me was allow me to do some laundry and the dishes while it rambled on.WAY too long!Overall just a bore.Pretty much the same as the Dark Knight Rises. About an hour too long.I really enjoyed the first movie in this trilogy and the third was way too long just like this stinker.I'm going to enjoy the little Bat lover comments when they start crying over my review. i can almost hear them now...""Oh, I've never met anyone at a Bat convention that did not like this movie. You must be demented! I must get you in my Bat embrace and wrench the goodness out of your review!""Bat lovers rest your dreary eyes. This one is truly a sleeper. ZZZZZZ.....",0
"This was a decent film but the Batman from the 90's was better than this, in my opinion. People have jumped on the bandwagon & exulted Heath Ledger but I'm afraid the film itself has been over hyped. That is my opinion, anyway. I think it was a decent film but at the time, with the hype, I was so looking forward to seeing it &, to be honest, it let me down fairly badly. I went to the pictures to see the first Batman, with Keaton & Jack Nicholson & that was a brilliant picture. Although I didn't see this at the pictures, I did watch it with great expectation &, as I say, I wasn't as impressed with it as I thought I would be. I think the hype around Heath Ledgers death at the time was the buoyancy around this film but it didn't live up to the expectations for me. But I hope that you can appreciate that this it my view.",0
"I found this movie too pretentious, too long and too boring. Christian Bale is wooden in his role, with his lips firmly squeezed together all the time. And his voice as Batman... Whah-Grah... Ridiculous. Maggie Gyllenhaal irritated me with constant(ironic?)smile on her face. The plot has serious holes. There are some unbelievable turnovers. During Major's speech, no one noticed a crazy guy with big scars in police uniform? And Joker manages to take over police station using a knife? Or a sequence when Batman runs into him on his motorcycle(or something like that) and then turns in the last second almost killing himself, because he is too good to kill a madman. What about Two-Face, who speaks and acts normally, although a half of his face is missing? The end is not very convincing: Batman took a guilt on himself, just to save a hope for citizens of Gotham? Give me a break. Fighting scenes could be better. It seems that Batman is a master of slow-motion fighting style. All in all... Very overrated movie.",0
"I loved the first film, but i just could escape the feeling that this was a lot more of a popcorn movie. The only bright spot in the movie for me was the joker brilliant insane agent of chaos.Played to the hilt by heath ledger. The were too many things that made no sense in the film and could only be explained by corporate interference,The man responsible for the first great film simply couldn't have made this mess(or so i thought)The heavily armoured ""tank like"" batmobile built for the army is taken out by a rocket?Thus batsy must eject in the bat pod and a new ""must buy"" toy vehicle for the kids. The military must have asked for a bridging vehicle that can eject a motor bike from wayne industries?? (an example of the military-industrial complex gone mad or completely non-sensical idea that the writer didn't think through?)Batman goes to hong kong for about 5 minutes to catch a man we barely see again.The bullet ""resistant"" armour is penetrated by a DOG?With kevlar Dentures perhaps?So now batsy has to have a completely different suit made and thus a completely new action figure for the kids.Ker chingThe gotham city of the first film looks completely different,even the brass looking monorail of batman begins(a major feature and plot point of the film) .It is replaced by the very dark industrial looking chicago elevated train system.And did they really think we wouldn't notice that the sandstone pointed-roof tower of wayne tower was suddenly morphed into Black flattop of completely different design.Several signs bellow ""welcome to chicago"" in the background.The new Rachel dawes is completely different and the new actress doesn't even try to emulate the character seen in the first film.An utterly pointless cameo from the scarecrow ,captured in 30 seconds flat .over all a wasted opportunity kind of like comparing x men to the dire sequels avoid",0
"In Hollywood, most of our movies have plots, in independent movies and those from overseas, more often than not movies have stories. A story is far superior to a plot. Plots fill in gaps with special effects and gimmicks and have awkward moments where the elements or story don't fit. It's like the difference between events related by a man who is telling the truth vs. a man making up a lie. The one man is focused like a beam of light, while the other is pulling rabbits out of his backside. Stories flow with smooth logic from event to event and have layers of meaning to be explored with additional viewings whereas a plot tends to be two dimensional. ""Batman Begins"" has a story and in my opinion is a masterpiece. ""The Dark Knight"" has a disjointed plot(with incredibly cool effects and gimmicks). All three Spiderman movies and The Fantastic Four movies have plots. ""V For Vendetta"" has a story to tell. ""Ironman"" has an improved plot.Batman is a twist on perhaps the oldest religious theme in human history, the battle between the light and darkness. The twist is that he is of darkness, but battles for the light. He is an alter ego that conforms neither to a constitution nor the laws of any land, but instead walks a very fine line which he must often step over into the realm of lawbreaker. This comic book character is a hijack waiting to happen for a pro-torture political argument.However, applying ""The Dark Knight"" movie as a metaphor to the real world is really problematic and is in fact a horribly flawed argument. In the context of the times, George W. Bush would be Bruce Wayne (ok when you're done laughing or throwing up) with a heroic but dark alter ego (Dick Cheney) that allows him to skirt the law and do what must be done for the good of the people.But seriously, the common theme of all Batman shows is that the ordinary police, courts, and judges are hopelessly incompetent, corrupt, and incapable of administering order and justice on behalf of the people. Therein lays the rationale for the existence of the Batman. The problem in the real world argument is that in this country, the justice system is none of these things, but does on occasion display such failings as they are after all human institutions. Our justice system with some fine tuning, such as removing the two tier system where the rich are favored over the poor (ie. O.J. murder trial), may in fact be the best justice system anyone's ever going to develop. To my knowledge, no one has topped it yet. So first and foremost, no such vigilante is required (particularly not a power drunk redneck who couldn't karate chop a ham sandwich). But I will say, Dick Cheney was ordained by God to play the character Penguin.Second, laws and particularly a constitution as a framework for government and to govern our ordinary lives, CANNOT be compromised without grave harm that inevitably destroys the foundation of the system in which they comprise. Commissioner Gordon ""looks the other way"" and ""abets"" Batman by supplying him with information, so that he may then do whatever he deems necessary to achieve the end result that they both wish for. In the case of ""The Dark Knight"", Batman drops a man from a building subsequently breaking one of his legs to get information that will save the lives of innocent people. This is a new turn in the chronicles of the comic book character. Previously he would do what was necessary to capture criminals, which sometimes resulted in inadvertent harm, but never intentionally inflicted harm upon the criminal beyond what was necessary to subdue them (Batman Begins he drops a guy but catches him). Batman would have pulled some ""truth serum"" off his belt and injected the bad guy with it, not throw him off a building. In the real world, if authorities look the other way or abet criminality, the system is not enhanced or enforced but instead crumbles on a slippery slope. Only in the fantasy world of comics does breaking the law make the system of law healthier and stronger.So why at this juncture in time does Batman begin to torture a bad man in a perfectly arranged scenario where torture seems justified and correct? The bomb is ticking and the innocent people will die if only Batman will put some serious hurt on a scummy guy who probably deserves it anyway. If he does this he can save two people (one of whom he loves). The director/writer Christopher Nolan is a Republican (donation records online). On ""The Dark Knights"" behalf perhaps it's not as far fetched at all to see Bruce Wayne as a Republican (rich and entitled). If Nolan does the next Batman, will the superhero do something to an abortion clinic doctor or deregulate a financial institution? Perhaps Batman will beat the excrement out of and torture the director/writer who hijacked this iconic superhero of my youth and turned him into a politically expedient whore with smeared lipstick.""They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."" Benjamin Franklin, 1775",0
"Poorly told movie, none of the Batman essences is here, It looks more like a realistic, movie about terrorism where two completely insane lunatics in weird costumes battle for the security of so called Gotham City. To be honest with you all, I just liked the batman movies done by Burton and since than Hollywood made one trash after another. This one included. Batman begins was really awful, to turn the story into such a way where you actually destroy the true starting of batman and now a Batman who is supposed to fight against his own ego, is powerless. I mean it's quite good when a super heroe has his problems fighting the bad, but here I didn't see what he is fighting against. Only good thing, is very well done special effects avoiding all this CGI fx. And maybe Heath ledger has done well. But that doesn't make a good movie. And oh yes, who the hell is Harvey Dent? For Christ sake, making out of bad two face a good two face. They should have given me the script in the hands then people tell would tell me now this is a truly dark film. This one was poor, too much light, too shiny and to luxury to be the dark gotham like I know it from the first comic books. I almost fell asleep. Sad.",0
"No villain could come close to matching Ledger's inspired Joker, but give Hardy credit for supplying Bane with plenty of conviction and gravitas in a movie that, frankly, is less about actors than knockout set pieces captured in eyeball-popping spectacles.As befits the saga's engagement with the economics of Gotham City, a great deal of topical material floats about here, insufficiently digested.The pleasure, however preposterous, is in Nolan's dedication -- creating, maintaining, and to an extent defending a universe in which people still take this stuff very seriously.If there were ever doubts about Christopher Nolan and his ability as a filmmaker, he puts all things to rest and declares himself one of the most innovative and visionary directors working today.",0
"This is in itself a pretty good movie. But as a Batman movie, it's an epic fail. Christian Bale is the worst Batman ever. No, he's not a bad actor - he's a really good actor, in fact. But he doesn't feel like a true Bruce Wayne at all. The Joker is too serious and realistically psychotic, and Harvey Dent does not suffer from having a split personality like he is supposed to have.And yeah, the biggest flaw of this movie and Batman Begins - they try so hard to be realistic, it's kinda pathetic. If Nolan wants to make his own movies, that's fine. But Batman, realistic? I don't care what people say - there's NOTHING realistic about a guy dressing up like a bat to fight crime. Nor should it be. The fans of the movie claims it's realistic because we are supposed to take it as serious as possible. Uhm, really? I'm sorry, but are the fans of this movie that dumb? Since when does it require a movie is realistic for us to take it serious? Was Watchmen realistic? Was Lord of the Rings realistic? Was Pan's Labyrinth realistic? Of course they weren't. Yet, all of them are easier to take serious than this overrated movie.It even breaks it's own rules of being realistic... and it does so all the time. Like when the Tumbler gets trashed, and Batman makes a bat-pod pop out of it. Now, this IS a cool thing to have in a Batman movie. Only problem is - this is supposed to be realistic... and that's everything BUT realistic to have such a convenient feature. And how about when Batman punches the Joker in the head several times without him fainting, or even getting dissy (except the first time)? Oh, and I guess it's really realistic near the end when Batman gets attacked by the rottweilers biting him and the Joker beating the living s**t out of him with a crowbar at the same time? And like I said, I don't get why they changed the Joker so much here. He seems almost insecure. And why does he have a plan to spread anarchy and chaos? The Joker is supposed to BE anarchy and chaos. But here, he's just a confused psycho who doesn't seem to know what he thinks himself. Oh, and the BS in the end when Batman tosses out the Joker - in self defense, mind you - to fall down the skyscraper, and then he manages to save him. What's that load of bull about? It wasn't even his fault... and how the heck could he catch him up so well? And really; if he was THIS careful about saving all the criminals from dying - wouldn't he have saved Ra's Al Ghul in the end of the first movie? He says ""I won't kill you... but I don't have to save you"". Uhm, that's technically to kill him, Batman. But hey, what do I know? Keeping the psychotic crime clown alive who will not stop for anything in his search for chaos might be a lot better than letting the one live who one could be able to discuss with, and who Bruce has a long friendship story with. Genius...And really, Nolan... you're dissing SO much from the ACTUAL Batman universe for the sake of your realism. Like villains such as Mr Freeze, Killer Croc, Clayface, Poison Ivy etcetera. And you are even dissing Robin because you are ""afraid people won't take that serious""? As far as I am concerned, Nolan is just too much of a coward to try to challenge himself to do things like they are supposed to be - and still making us take it serious. I mean, come on - Batman: Under the Red Hood did this. Sure, it was an animated movie.... but weird enough, it felt more authentic than the Nolan flicks. Isn't that saying something? Batman should not live in a realistic world, period. I mean, come on - they didn't even try to make Gotham City in the movies original and unique. To quote behind-the-scenes from Batman Begins, their Gotham City is ""New York on steroids"". This movie does not deserve it's praising.",0
"First off the good thing. The movie has some really funny jokes and creative scenes in it. For a while it seems like it could become interesting.Sadly, one gets disappointed. The movie lacks real depth. I didn't really think it would have much depth, so that's not what really disappointed me. However the lack of it isn't compensated by good special effects, violence or interesting characters. It is defiantly different from other Batman movies and one could maybe consider it as an experiment to mix an action film based on a comic with more casual parts. However it least this time I wouldn't call it a success.It was said this movie is very violent, but it is only when compared to other Batman movies. One should expect it to be any where to splatter, horror or even psycho thrillers.Still not everything is bad. I am certainly not a Heath Ledger fan, but he had an awesome performance.If you are looking for an action movie it may still be worth watching it, even if you aren't a big fan of other films based on comics.Maybe my reason for disliking this film is just that I focused too much on characters besides Joker.",0
"To start, I'm gonna just quickly vent.The Dark Knight is overrated. And chock full of plot stupidity.All Batman had to do was kill the damn Joker.Thou Shalt Not Kill rule be damned.End of problem. End of story.He also gives up his moral high ground reasoning when he lies about Two Face (who he killed with his own actions, by the way).Now that that's done, time for the substance behind the (dark) magic.As many others have said before me, there is more (over)emphasis on exploring symbols, ideologies and themes rather than the characters who are supposed to embody these ideas and ideals, leading to the characters feeling cut and dry due to half-baked writing.Batman swings across the Lawful spectrum so much like a pendulum that he just becomes annoying to watch. From disregarding other people's vigilantism (yeah, because having the training and the money automatically makes you all set, right?), to brutally smashing criminals' faces in, to refusing to kill any criminal no matter how dangerous they might be, to lying to the public, this Batman is one that lacks any charisma and doesn't give me any real reason to root for him.Not to mention that Bruce kills Harvey (inadvertently, but since this is Batman, the point still stands), who is a traumatized Tragic Villain driven to insanity, while leaving Joker alive in captivity. Moral inconsistency much?Speaking of which...Joker is just a Straw Nihilist with no profound reasoning or understanding for his motives. You want a sympathetic nihilist? Look at General Shepherd from Modern Warfare 2. Back to Joker, the film doesn't even have much logical explanations on how he can pull off his outlandish criminal stunts - which is detrimental to a film that wants to deconstruct and add realistic grit to damn well everything.Also, 3 hour blockbuster movies becoming the norm can be a standard that can rot in hell.To sum up, this is not The Dark Knight.It is Lawful Stupid: The Movie.An overrated and overhyped film unfortunately brought to the world by an overrated and an overhyped film director.",0
"First of all I must say that when the new Batman project was announced, I had good memories and the best expectations. I watched eagerly on the big screen Batman Begins. As long the movie was reeling forward my enthusiasm was reeling back. Boring, lot of good actors lost on a non coherent story and then the end credits.I didn't doubt for a second that maybe I was too much attached to the Burton's ones, that probably with Beetlejuice,ScissorHands and Nightmare Before...are his best movies as Director because later he lost his magic.The three movies from this new revamp are overrated and totally waste the chance to really bring the dark knight into a fresh and mature path.Lot of money wasted on nothing ,the plots are bold and the actors wasted. The Nolan touch in my opinion overrated, ruins this saga the same as the Inception film and the Superman's revamping.Unless in Marvel they try to be close to their comics, to maintain the spirit cause one good thing about the comics is that the script is already done not need to change much just adapt it visually to the big screen. No more no less.Mario Puzo can teach Nolan how to write a serious superhero's movie.I know almost everyone high rates this saga but with the same theory everybody loves junk food and it doesn't mean its nutritious or healthy.",0
"While no doubt a big budget, box office hit, the hype surrounding this movie is what I feel the '9.1' score is based off, rather than quality film making, scripting and acting. Let me explain...Christian Bale delivers a solid batman performance once again, but his raspy 'batman' voice gets laughable at times and one cant help but to think he may have blew an o-ring trying to add some nuts to the voice. Supporting cast (freeman, etc) is all around decent, but definitely loses points in my book for dropping the lead actress from the first film. Perhaps Kate Holmes was going through Scientology boot camp.Gary Oldman was the real treat here, watching him act is always a pleasure and I'm very excited that he landed the role of Gordon (and kept it). Definitely one of the best actors of our time. And finally, the Joker. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Ledger did a fair job at playing the Joker, but his performance seemed based off Nicholson's joker a little too much for me. Talk of a Best Actor award for this role is for the birds, but will probably be awarded by default to the late Heath Ledger (RIP). The film makers claimed to have finished filming by the time Mr. Ledger passed, but I couldn't help but feel that the ending was rushed and felt entirely incomplete, since we never really see what finally happens to the Joker, unless they have already shot footage for the 3rd installment...like how they closed things up with scarecrow in the beginning of this flick (which also felt too rushed). After Harvey Dent's transformation into two-face, his role in the batman universe was NOT done to justice. He had about a 20 minute screen time appearance that was pretty sparse in between other plot lines. I feel two-face is a big part of the Batman legacy and should have had more focus. In the end he felt like a character that was stuffed in quickly in a re-draft to add more sub plots... They should have not had him at all, or waited for the right time to bring him in full swing and for a longer stay.All in all, it's a pretty solid eye candy kind of movie for the kids on a Friday night. There's not much thinking that needs to be done on the sidelines, however at a 152 minute runtime, the movie begins to wear out it's welcome at points and does catch some drag on the mushy plot spots... A mildly enjoyable follow up, but not better than Batman Begins.5/10",0
"The Dark Knight is not an exceptional movie, period. Heath's Joker was good, perhaps several times better than Jack Nicholson's. Nevertheless, it was just another good performance - nothing groundbreaking.The action, the drama, the suspense - agreed, its all there. But haven't we seen all this so many times before? Some of the Joker's schemes - such as the two ferries that were to be blown up at 12am - seemed reminiscent of those from Speed (Keanu Reeves). The gadgets were like James Bond on steroids, Wayne Enterprises was just unbelievably lax about its operations, and everything that could have seemed odd in Bruce Wayne's personal life was so easily covered up. This should have remained a comic book.Batman Begins was a much better movie in comparison. It had something fresh, a new beginning, a new story on offer. This is just a remake of past concepts - the only difference being that one of the lead actors died and ended up being glorified beyond imagination.Watch Batman Begins instead.",0
"I really did enjoy this movie, I think it was a great sequel to the original which I feel a lot of people are overlooking due to the fact that Heather Ledger passed away before the release which helped the movie get a lot of buzz. Apparently I am one of few people to feel that the original was better if not equal, it gave the viewers so much background and answered so many questions, it really was a great re-boot for the franchise and I feel many people forget that fact, I understand that usually most sequels are very poor and nothing compared to the original, and this movie was not one of those at all, it was a very good movie but is it better than the original?? I really don't think it is, I think that Heath really did a great job, and should be acknowledged for it, I think so many people are caught up in Heath's passing that they are blowing this movie up so much. I think after a while people will settle down and really view the movie as it should be. Its sad that he passed away, but judge the movie as a whole not on one characters performance.",0
"This was not a bad movie, but had way too much going on, and went on too long - I started looking at my watch after about an hour and fifteen minutes, and the last half-hour seemed like an eternity. Sometimes it seems as if pictures such as this one are made for audiences who are easily bored or who have ADD. Too many explosions, car crashes, too many plot points, not enough substance. Heath Ledger's characterization was interesting, but in light of his death it is difficult to objectively analyze his performance. The other performances were so-so. The movie takes itself a bit too seriously; it is, after all, a film about a comic-book character, and doesn't resonate the way a truly great film like The Godfather does.",0
"This movie is not worth watching. Most certainly not worth paying the full price at the theaters. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it full four stars. This is another blow to my confidence in his reviews and ratings. The bad part about it is that I'll have to find other ways to get reviews before going to see a movie.The first thirty minutes of the movie seemed o.k., when the characters and the story is set up. Some action here and there, mixed with the Joker's evil ways. Then at about the 2 hour mark I wondered when it was going to be over. It's got way too much dialog, and not a good one at that. Whenever the cameras got a closeup of Batman, played by Christian Bale (Empire of the Sun), with the mask and suit on I couldn't help but marvel at his mouth and his pronunciations. It's the lisp. It's like Daffy Duck, Jay Leno, and Barney Frank the gay politician from Massachusetts. It's like the Austin Powers scene with the ""mole"" on the guy's face. He couldn't get over it. I couldn't get over it.The Joker's mouth and the way he talked also got to me. He kept licking his lips while talking. It was o.k. at first, but when he has so much dialog with so much lip licking, one can't help but wander off and start to think about how the studio actually inserted the licking sound every time he did it. I was licking MY mouth. I prefer Jack Nicholson.If I had been by myself I would definitely walk out of this movie, but I was with three other people. I even considered just going outside and waiting for them. That's how bad I didn't like this film.The only thing that makes this movie tolerable for so long is the all-star support which includes Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules), Gary Oldman (The Fifth Element), Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles, Johnny Be Good), and Eric Roberts (Runaway Train). But even with these guys in the film it's pretty bad.If this movie is the best movie according to IMDb, I think it's time to move on to other film sites.",0
"I first feel the need to make something very clear; whilst i'm a casual fan of the Batman Comics i in no way went into this film with any presumption or expectancy of how close i wanted it to stay to Batman's origins. I will not judge The Dark Knight-or any film- based on comparisons.So where do we start here?Mark Kermode- who's taste and good judgement seems increasingly less reliable these days-once congratulated Director Christopher Nolan on marrying the Pop Corn Block-bluster with Art House and bringing it to the mainstream. I disagree with Kermode very very strongly about that. On the basis of this film (and subsequent ones) Nolan could not stage and shoot a decent action sequence to save his live. Take the truck chase- one of the most boring, confused and poorly executed chase sequences i have ever seen. Nolan seems determined to destroy any sense of momentum or excitement with his trademark messy camera angles and jarring edits. He inexplicably ignores every fundamental narrative technique when filming all his action set pieces, techniques that you appreciate are established for good reason when you witness the horribly convoluted mess he makes of things. If i was ever on the edge of my seat watching The Dark Knight it was because i was agitated and bored not tense. Nolan even manages to turn climatic dilemmas involving ticking bombs into yawn fest. As for this film being regarded as intelligent, it seriously isn't.Embarrassing pseudo-intellectuality is all that's on offer here- dished out by Michael Caine's Alfred in faux pearls of wisdom. Nolan writing monologues for Caine in which he merely states the bleeding obvious in a way that's supposed to sound profound is becoming quite a stalwart now. The use of Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox as a prominent character and as Bruce Wayne's moral conscious and voice of reason is basically a cop out by the writers; why didn't they want to fully explore the inner conflict created in Wayne that comes from being responsible for his own restraint and decisions? Despite all the War on Terror rhetoric Nolan avoids having to REALLY examine just how right wing a concept Batman is by having a moderator absolve him and make controversial decisions on his behalf.Ledgers grungy, twitching, lip smacking joker is the only reason i gave this film any stars at all. He couldn't be more different to the clown prince of crime played by Jack Nicholson in Burton's 1989 film- yet they are definitely the same in one aspect: They both completely walk away with their movies; mainly due to the fact in neither cases is there much to walk off with.Its called The Dark Knight and Batman is a non entity really. For a film that the makers insisted they were going for realism with there are as many plot holes and contrivances as there are in your average brain dead Hollywood silliness but its even more noticeable here because of how solemn and po-faced it all is. Subplots that go no where. Characters that were simply pointless.Half way in i found myself actually glancing at my watch wondering how long it could go on for; its 152 minutes running time feels more like 5 hours. 5 dismal, hours. How on earth this movie is considered an all time great is beyond me. Its an utter mess i don't care how well it did at the box office or how many critics poured over it.",0
"This is not a Batman movie. It is just wrong. Again with the realism! Batman isn't supposed to be realistic and when you make Batman realistic it doesn't feel like Batman anymore. This movie is full of speeches! All the Joker does is vomit up dialogue. He also doesn't even look like the Joker. The Joker is supposed to use toy-like gadgets and weapons not all real weapons. Now onto Batman. Christian Bale is once again terrible and is not fitting in the role. His voice is the worst voice ever! This also has to be the most overrated film of all time. People rave that this is the best Batman movie ever. No it isn't! This doesn't even feel or look like a Batman movie. This is even less creative than Batman Begins. It is also even more boring. I am so sad to see my favorite superhero be reduced to a growling, dancing, and uninteresting character. Nolan is to into making his Batman films realistic that he forgets one of the most important that make a Batman movie and that is creativity. You have to be creative when making a film on any superhero especially Batman. It is just something that lacks in his Batman films. This is such a bad movie.",0
"Being one of about three people who didn't like Nolan's ""Memento"" I know I will be in the minority on not liking ""The Dark Knight"". But here goes. I thought this movie was awful. It was boring. And when it wasn't boring it was pretentious. And when it wasn't pretentious it didn't make any sense. It has to be one of the most poorly edited films I've seen. There always seemed to be three things happening at once and every time one event became involving, the movie would cut away (on an action no less)to a second or third event until you weren't sure which event was happening where and when. Not only was this completely confusing, it undercut the tension in any one of the single events. The action sequences, where Batman is actually involved in a fight or a car chase are so mangled they are drained of all excitement. The fistfights are too close-up and choppy and the motorcycle/truck chase is all over the screen with no continuity or point of view. It's a total mess. So is the overall plot. It tries so hard to be ""complex"" it defeats itself on a dramatic level. It's trying to thwart audience expectations, but you know, sometimes audience expectations should be honored. Aren't super-hero movies supposed to be fun? This is about as much fun as walking barefoot through an open landfill. When I think about it, the answer to that question is ""no"". Arguably, The Terminator is a super-hero and he isn't much fun. But the first two Terminators were fun;and they were as dark as could be. The rest of these comments are just random thoughts I had, watching the movie. They are disjointed and perhaps non-sensical, but then, so was the movie. The Dark Knight completely lacks a sense of humor, unless you count the Joker's insanity. Heath Ledger was great at first, but his ""Crazy"" act became repetitive and started to grate after ten minutes. There's not a single likable character, or actor to play them. And the Gotham Police Department seems to have recruited it's staff from a local home for the mentally challenged. Why are Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Alfie in this? Couldn't they throw a bone to some struggling unknown actors and let them play these disposable roles? Maggie Gyllenhaal has all the appeal of a bruised cantaloupe. I was routing for her to die. When did Batman start disguising his voice by talking like Astro from the Jetson's. Like people really aren't going to recognize the bottom half of his face anyway? Wouldn't Harvey Dent's facial burns require at least a little Solarcaine to keep from getting infected and killing him? How did the Joker manage to pay for all that gasoline before he robbed the bank? The only scene I thought was good was when the Joker pushed Maggie off of the Wayne building and Batman swooped down to save her. Maybe because it reminded me of the same scene from Superman? What I hated most was all the holier than thou (Batman!) moral posturing by the filmmakers when they are marketing this disturbingly violent picture to kids. And then they have a little boy on screen being threatened with a gun to the head. It's pretty sick. People in this movie are brutally murdered and physically threatened usually by gun, or by knife, and even by a pencil. The theater where I saw this was packed with little kids. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN.",0
"I hate to buck popular opinion, (not really), but I thought this movie was too long, too boring, too confusing and two out of ten. Perhaps I had unreasonable expectations. But I walked away from the movie thinking that this was probably the biggest ""four-wall"" in cinema history. If Heath Ledger wins an Academy Award for this turkey, the Academy should apologize to Harold and Kumar for being overlooked twice. This poor guy mumbles through this unrecognizable part like an amateur. And, how may plot lines does any movie need? I intensely dislike movies that have to set up the sequel. This is the most blatant sequel set-up since ""The Empire Strikes Back."" And what's with Maggie Gyllenhaal in the female, romantic, lead? Were all the attractive, talented, females busy? Maybe she'd be better suited for a remake of ""Tugboat Annie,"" but I wouldn't say for sure whether she should play Marie Dressler's or Wallace Beery's role. Christian Bale? Bale of what? Certainly not delivering dialogue. Aaron Eckhart? Better suited for a small screen sit-com. Gary Oldman? Actually a bright spot, delivering his usual flawless performance that so rarely gets noticed. The caped crusader should become the crepe draped crusader. Try again fellas.",0
"This movie was good for a ""Comic book movie"" at best and thats it! sure the acting was good, but as far as the rest of the movie goes same ole same ole, yes, thats about it! nothing new with the plot or theme! I don't see how people can even begin to rate this movie as the best move ever!? I think most people who rate this movie the best movie ever haven't been exposed to much movies outside the usual summer Hollywood blockbuster bore! In fact if we stick to the proper genre of this film (Comic Book movie) I think Sin City was a better movie then Dark Knight, again, as far as comic book movies go! I gave this movie a rating of 2 simple because of all the ridiculous ratings people have been given it, which is not justified. I would have given it more if not for all the unjustified high ratings by the summer movie blockbuster fans! Therefore, I hope people with the same opinion as me will rate this movie low enough to bring it down a couple of notches where it belongs.Oh yes, and whats with the ridiculous voice Bale puts on while he's got the outfit on?! I mean hello?! This is a comic book movie so at this point one would think that the audience have suspended their disbelief, right? One would think so with the ratings people have given this film!? so we can all assume that his identity is pretty much hidden without trying to sound like Howlin' Wolf with a nasty cold!",0
"Oh, well, here we go again.....the mob mentality, the cult figure who dies from a drug overdose and automatically catapults a mediocre movie into instant cult status. I can't remember one memorable line from the first half of this movie, and to be honest, there is very little worth remembering.In my opinion,it appeared as if everyone was sleepwalking their way through their performances, and Heath Ledger's wasn't really a stretch or any more significant that any other Joker.Let's hope they make one last Batman film and this time they have the formula to get it right.I should have spent my money to see the X-Files movie....and so it goes.",0
"I gave it 4. Its not as good as Batman with Jack Nicholson. This one is too much action and FX. I don't understand what was so good in acting of Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Aaron Eckhart, Their acting is very stiff, rather boring and truly nothing worth mentioning. As usual Michale Cane and Morgan Freeman are playing well, but all in all its just another action packed, special effects movie without anything that would stay in your mind and heart after you exit the theatre. In my opinion, this got so high notes only because of tragic death of Heath Ledger and the media attention that the role of Joker was suppose to be the cause of his death. I don't buy it and I don't buy opinions of PR guys and film critics. Giving it at least some objectivity, this movie deserves max 7 points. I m not that big fan of comics so I m not much into Batman, thats why my personal opinion is just 4/10",0
"Wow, saw the movie yesterday and must say I was completely disappointed in the whole thing. I enjoy action movies - Transformers, Superman, Spiderman - basically every comic known to the world and the common theme that good does indeed win over evil. Not in this movie- The DA Dent - the hero figure was bent into an evil monster. The heroine - blown to bits. Batman at the end a criminal hunted by the police ............. the notion - either you die a hero or stick around long enough to be the villain........ yup that is pretty much this whole movie. Batman was one dimensional. I did enjoy MC's Alfred but for me that was the bright spot as well as Morgan being the one that had morals. The scene where the boat captives had to choose - totally unbelievable - crazy convict would do the right thing ........ right. It is a twisted version .... a once great comic hero that now is a - should I do this or not type of guy. As in Jerry Maguire .... that is NOT what inspires people. It was a disturbing movie that I wished I had skipped.",0
"Everything you need to know is in the title. If you want to see an astounding portrayal of the Joker, then go see Joaquin Phoenix nailing the role in ""Joker"".",0
"I thought this was the least satisfying of the series (with Batman Begins as the best). Certainly the high point was Heath Ledger's performance, which was even more impressive since the character was written without any depth. He did have some good lines though. The down sides: the plot was extremely weak, much of the dialog was drowned out by an oppressive soundtrack and the overlong movie was dragged down by the lack of meaningful story direction with too much of the action in low light. There were also too many questions left at the end. All in all, not very believable. In contrast Iron Man was a masterpiece and a far superior movie.",0
"What a let-down! All this talk has talked up the movie and the only relationship with the reality of the movie, is that in it there's way too much talking. Loads of earnest blah blah. From The Joker too and comically, in a very throaty fashion from Christian Bale. This would be an extremely rare misfire if he'd had anything enough to do to actually affect its outcome. Batman is a characterless suit with a sore throat while the joker is a nutter, unsurprisingly. Batman Begins was a good film, easily the best of the batman bunch. This one is just a normal movie made kind of laughable by the corny dialog. Blah blah suit blah make-up blah explosion blah suit make-up blah explosion blah blah blah.",0
"I went into this film expecting it to be amazing. I read most of the reviews on IMDb and people are wowed and amazed at the excellence of the film. I fail to share this amazement. And to suggest this is the best film ever made beating greats like the Godfather and the shawshank redemption.First of all batman plays a minor role in the whole film. He Occasionally appears. And when he does a stupid voice that sounds like he needs some cough medicine just gets more irritating every time you hear it. Bruce Wayne Played batman with no enthusiasm, just a boring, bland character. On the other hand Heath Ledger did play the Joker very well which is some constellation to the film.Second of all when they rob the bank at the beginning the school bus pinpoints the robber to hit and still manages to drive away after smashing thought a 10 inch thick wall. Then the police which are about 100m away fail to see the school bus drive out ? And the scene where Batman's suit can be penetrated by dogs but not by bullets ? This is ridiculous.Near the end rocket launchers are fired at the police van batman is being contained in. After Numerous shots there isn't even a dent in the side of it. In Iraq armed tanks can be blow up with a simple rocket launcher but an armoured police van cannot ? And a plane manages to attach itself to a thin piece of wire without ripping it to shreds ? The joker blows up a hospital but gave warning for some reason, did it in broad daylight ? The police are two miles away for safety but it would all make too much sense to have a helicopter or a bomb disposal unit on site ? The Final thing that actually made me laugh was the way he invented sonar to access phones. How could you possibly invent something like that in a couple of days !!! This Film was just a joke and I really cant see how people can suggest its going to threaten titanic as the biggest box office film ever.A Stupid Unbelievable Film that uses no common sense at all .",0
"The good:This movie was an improvement over the juvenile and cartoon like depiction of batman from the prior series.The action was good. Heath Ledger did a great job as the joker. There was some decent character development on him.I liked the cameo in the movie to the original TV comic TV series.The bad:Batman is not a comic (as in funny) figure, however that doesn't mean the movie has to be devoid of comedy to give peaks and valleys to the violence and disturbing trip down the dark shaft of the criminally insane that Batman journeys to.The movie was as dry as a martini with humor. You wont find it.Batman's voice when he has his cowl on is extremely annoying. It sounds like someone trying to talk tough who isn't.No further character development of Bruce Wayne. The original Batman actually did a better job with this.The whole fake death of commissioner Gordon seem forced into the plot like a square peg in a round whole.Again, the movie makers depart from the Comic strip and kill off the Joker. Batman and the Joker are linked and in the comic book he goes through a deal of effort to make sure he lives.Out of the three comic book to screen adaptations this summer: Batman, Iron Man, and the Hulk. The Hulk is best.",0
"In reality, I give this film a score of ""4 out of 10"", but the one-star rating you see above is intended to balance out the obvious shill vote (marketing hype, ""astroturf"", 10/10 votes and comments by paid-for marketing weenies posing as real, unbiased people).At the time of this writing, the film has a 9.7-out-of-10 rating which it clearly does not in any sense deserve. It merits half that rating.I saw ""Batman"" last night. 2.5 hours meant that one gets one's money's worth, but heck... it's not half as good as advertisers and IMDb.com would have us believe. The plot line drags, the characters are shallow, the morality is deeply confused and wildly warped.The ""dark knight"" is more like a dim bulb.It's hard to believe in Heath Ledger as the Joker. He's just too broad in the face, one-dimensional in this role, and weighed down by poor writing. His makeup was supposed to be degrading throughout the film, but there were obvious touch-ups and clean-ups that reminded the audience ""this is make-believe."" His garb was supposed to be purple-on-green, but was so dark as to look like a black suit. His actions were so reckless that we, as an audience, were constantly reminded that ""this ain't even close to reality. Even a toddler wouldn't believe that this scheme would leave The Joker alive and thriving.""Worse, we're given zero back-story to help us believe that The Joker's feelings and craziness are based on something. In fact, the film goes far out of its way to emphasize that The Joker has no past, no legitimate reason for his hatred and aggression, and is simply not understandable. To that, I say ""Go back to scriptwriting school, and take a few psychology classes while you're there. A character isn't menacing or intriguing unless we see the mechanism driving the emotions.""Worse, Christian Bale as Batman. Christian Bale, though good at dieting and working out, has all the humanity and emotiveness of rotting firewood. Without a sound track, sure, he'd do well as a male model. As a actor, though, he's just taking up space on the screen. Worse, his lisping (with obvious sound effects to lower and strengthen his voice) make him unbelievable as Batman and as perfectionist billionaire.Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) gave an unemotive performance. Worse, he seemed to be struggling with his accent so much that he had no time for other aspects of acting. This is NOT the caliber of performance that he delivered for ""Leon"" (""The Professional"") and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". This was an obvious potboiler, walk-on-and-take-the-money performance.Likewise for all the other performers except hyperactive Heath Ledger and a small one-dimensional part played by the wife of one character. I felt no emotion from any of the other actors and actresses, despite the big ups and downs in the plot line. Dammit, if your daddy dies or you quit your lifelong job, y'oughta look a little broken up!With two exceptions, the special effects did nothing for me: 1) I felt a bit of adrenalin when Batman was standing on a ledge atop a skyscraper while the camera looked over his shoulder into the street. 2) Harvey Two-face's mask was well done: that gets a thumbs up, though I wouldn't want kids seeing it or they'll have nightmares.A few scenes just left me scratching my head, saying ""that would never happen; that's beyond stupid, even for a cartoon movie."" When Batman glides down from one building on his wings, darn it, the wings should look full of air like a parachute, not luffing like a sail pointed in the wrong direction!Even the love interest was a bit bland. They found a frumpy, not-too-pretty woman to play Batman's love-of-his-life, and apparently asked her to play her role as though nothing-- romance, impending death, and explosions-- matters. I've seen people react more strongly when they get the wrong kind of coffee from a Starbucks! >:oThe morality is twisted. From a comic book, one should expect flat, one-dimensional thinking. From Frank Miller, the talented artist but stupid Ayn Rand follower who wrote the comic book on which this film is based, one should expect wildly offensive ""morality"" that would make even an idiot say ""wtf, man, rethink this!"" The plot and characters will inevitably be compared to America's McCarthyist-style ""war on terrorism"", and that just sickens me, because I see the film try to justify a patronizing, lying, violent attitude from government and a billionaire.Everywhere in the film, actors are saying ""This is wrong-headed, illegal, untruthful, patronizing to the citizenry, and an abuse of power... but we're in a dark, scary time so it's OK for now."" Art imitates life, eh! I felt deeply ill.So far this summer, Hancock is the only superhero movie I'd endorse, and that would only get a weak thumbs-up. It's at least funny, and does not try to paint a comic-book morality as ""heroic"".So what SHOULD you see as an action/popcorn movie this summer? I'm wondering if the ""Voyage to the Center of the Earth"" film or the new Mummy film, both starring Brendan Frasier, will be a bit better... or at least have a few funny lines. The trailers, though, hint that they'll be campy and unbelievable.",0
"The Action scenes are without style. beat = cut, beat = cut, beat = cut. you understand what i mean? the boring action scenes i have ever seen. And Heath Ledger as Joker is overrated, and also Christopher Nolan as Director.My Favorite Action and Movie Director/Producer of all Time is Steven Spielberg. He created action scenes with style in many of his movies!Compare Action-Scenes from Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan. And as you can see, Steven is the Master of Action!",0
"There is no way that this movie should be the number one on IMDb's list it is in no way just to this site. Although it was an enjoyable film that did keep me entertained i could not get over the way people were talking about this movie.The number one thing that bothered me about this movie is editing there was no need for many little scenes in this movie which is why the movie ran a bit long for my taste.The other issue that bothered me was TWO FACE???? He looked so ridiculous that i could not take him seriously. They should have made his other half looked like it had been burned (which is not what they did in my opinion). People cant just walk around without skin on, this was a big distraction for me and could have easily been dealt with if someone had the balls to talk to Nolan he is only human and therefore can make mistakes.All in all a good movie but please take it off the number one movie on the list.",0
"I will keep this short because my point is easy to get. I think the movie was very over hyped and lacked the creativity Tim Burton brought to the original. The location for the movie did not capture the gritty mystic feel Gotham City has. I mean that is a big part of the movie, isn't it? So that threw me off from the get go and I never really adjusted to it after that. It was almost like I was waiting to see Spider Man come swinging through from building to building The highlight was The Joker as I thought, Heath was excellent but that is pretty much where the excellence stopped for me. Also the Joker's background history was non-existent, he kind of just came out of no where with no explanation?? Bale is a horrible Batman and barely an okay Bruce Wayne. The missing bat cave & Wayne Manor were huge negatives too... In addition to what the movie missed it was very drawn out a much longer than it needed to be.",0
"Last night I went to see what I thought was going to be a Superhero movie. I left the theater feeling betrayed. Warner Brothers and D.C. comics tricked me into going to see a shitty, 3 hour cop movie/crime drama.I was prepared for a movie with a darker tone even than 2005's Batman Begins. I really enjoyed Batman Begins. It had the splendor and wonder one expects from a superhero movie, while introducing a deeper, more adult atmosphere. The Dark Knight keeps the adult, but loses the splendor.My issues with this film are numerous, so we'll begin with what I knew about it going in. They shot this film on location in Chicago. Gotham City is more than just a city. It carries with it a certain imagery of over the top Gothic architecture. It is shiny on the top, and seedy on the bottom. This imagery was present in Tim Burton's films, as well as Batman Begins. The Dark Knight's Gotham City just looks like....Chicago. As a frequent visitor to the windy city I even found myself, during the film, calling out tourist locations.Director Christopher Nolan made this creative choice to ground his audience in a certain reality, but guess what? I didn't go to see Batman for reality. I went to see a fantasy film. That it took place in a city I've been to took me out of the fantasy.Secondly, this movie is too long. At nearly three hours, I found myself staring at the ceiling and making ""get on with it already"" hand motions. From a story telling perspective, this movie has six acts. Count them SIX! There's a first act, and a second, but then the story devolves with four third acts. First they catch the Joker, then he gets away then they have to save Harvey and what's her name, then The Joker blows up a hospital then The Joker is going to blow up some boats. Choose one! Choose one of those third acts and you have a winner. But Four?Prolonging the film even more, is the Harvey Dent B-story that doesn't even start until after the second third act. This plot really needed to be the next film in the series. Dent is a complex character, and Two-Face could have been a great main villain. But, stuck away in a movie about The Joker, the character was wasted. He only had one scene (as Two Face) with Batman, and by the time Two-Face was introduced, I was already ready to leave the theater already.The aspect of The Dark Knight that made me truly realize how much I hated it is the violence. Two scenes in particular stand out. Once, Batman has to stop some S.W.A.T. team members from shooting some innocent people dressed as The Joker's henchmen. Instead of saying ""Hey guys don't shoot the clowns!"" He beats them up and strings them from a rope over the 30th story of a skyscraper. Are you kidding me? This Batman always takes the more violent way out (short of guns and killing of course).The scene that almost made me walk out had Two-Face jamming a revolver in the earlobe of Commissioner Gordon's kid. Come on! I hate censorship but are we really a society that has fantasy movies where we threaten to kill kids? I want to see superhero movies with my kids, but my step-son will be 21 before he's able to watch this. Gimme a break! While I've been typing this I've seen 3 Batman related commercials on Nickelodeon. So are you making a movie for kids? You're advertising to them, and pointing guns at their brains.The worst part about this film, and the thing that I keep harping on, is that it is not fantasy. It is not a superhero movie. It is a cop drama. The Joker is kind out of control, and Batman wears a suit, but otherwise its just an action movie starring Vin Diesel. ""But Pirate Ninja, this is more like the comic books."" Well, those comic books suck.Okay, they may not suck, but if the writers at D.C. have decided to change Batman from a superhero then they have made a grave mistake. The ""the comic books"" you're talking about started in 1986, but the Batman character dates back to 1939. So you tell me which is a better representation of the character.I like superhero movies. I do not like cop dramas. I do not like shoot-em-up, blow-em-up action flicks. I feel like I have been duped into spending money on a film that I would not have gone to had it not had a character named Batman.Through all this panning I do have to say I did enjoy the acting in this film. Christian Bale is alright, Heath Ledger was phenomenal (as all accounts indicate) Aaron Eckhart was great, Maggie Gyllenhaal brought more to her performance as what's her name than Katie Cruise did, and even Morgan Freeman had more to do this time, including a moral choice.",0
"I just knew from the very first moment I set eyes on The Joker that he'd later show up wearing a dress. And I was right. He did.Yep. The Joker looked so absolutely divine sashaying around in his nurse's frock and fright wig. He was a truly frustrated transvestite, if I ever saw one. You can bet there was a genuine drag queen hiding out underneath all of that smeared mascara, smudged lipstick and flaking pancake make-up. He didn't fool me one bit.And besides all of that - Other than being an even worse monster than his father (who he obviously hated with a passion), The Joker had no real background to his character. I found Heath Ledger's portrayal of this villain to be neither sinister, nor menacing, just incredibly small, petty and irksomely annoying, very much like a pesky mosquito that just won't go away.And, like, I know that The Joker had connections with the criminal underworld, and all - But, hey! - Where the hell did he get his hands on all of those explosives needed to blow up the hospital, etc., etc.? Eh? Where? And, when did the setting up of all these explosives take place? Do you not realize just how much TNT power would be required to topple a building the size of the hospital? - Hello!? - That much dynamite couldn't be just easily tucked away inside a closet, or whatever, without somebody (like, maybe, security?) not detecting it well in advance..... Sheesh! And, what was with that frickin' piece of petrified wood, actor Christian Bale, and his voice sounding like he's got a severe throat infection, or something? Was that Bale's idea of sounding butch? Of all the actors who have ever played the Batman character, (next to Michael Keaton) I'd say that Bale has got to be the ultimate worst. He was about as shallow and boring as you could possibly get. Even Adam West of TV's Batman made a more dynamic superhero than this doofus did. And that ain't saying much.And, when it came to our leading lady (the bland, pudding-faced Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachael Dawes), she was the most dog-ugly, flat-chested nothing I ever saw. And, yet, this frumpy-looking bag had not one, but two, pretty-haired pretty boys (in the dynamic duo of Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent) lusting after her, hot'n'heavy, ready to do battle on a moment's notice..... Like, spare me! Basically, I found The Dark Knight to be the sort of movie that was clearly meant for people who can't (or won't) think things through for themselves to a logical conclusion. The Dark Knight was so full of laughable inconsistencies and gaping plot holes that it inevitably sucked, big time.Yep. I could literally go on for days tearing into this film - A perfectly flawed story for this doomsday era, if there ever was one. After all of the huge build-up and excited praise that The Dark Knight has garnered for itself I feel completely cheated and, yes, disgusted, by what I was so pathetically offered here.And because of its major disappointment factor, this picture doesn't deserve more than a 4 star rating as far as I'm concerned. No, it doesn't.",0
"People who like this movie have no taste in movies, I have seen some bad movies in my life, but I can honestly say this is the worst movie I have seen. I can not see how people think this movie is any good, honestly the only thing that made people like this is the fact that it was one of the last movies Heath Ledger was in before he died. Christian Bale's voice throughout the movie gave me a headache, the story line was horrible, and this is just a movie for batman fans who have no hope left in another good movie. To tell the complete truth Batman & Robin with Arnold Schwarzenegger was a better movie, and that was atrocious.",0
"My partner and I were very surprised by how boring this was! I started checking email on my PDA just to pass the time - something I have never done at a movie I paid for! Lots of chase scenes, (which I find dull anyway) but sort of average ones-- nothing special. Obvious plot - I realize this originates from a comic, and so is painted with a broad brush, good versus evil, mad versus sane, blah-blah, but thought from reviews that this somehow reached beyond that. It didn't. Not-spectacular special effects. Atmosphere-- Gloomy Gotham, etc, Yawn. I did not see that the acting redeemed it it any way. Some cute lines, but not enough to make it worth seeing. Not awful, just not very interesting.",0
"I believe the this movie exceeds in 40 minutes. It's conflicts far beyond the story of Batman versus Joker in the new and ephemeral villain: two-face.Sometimes folks comic superheroes don't have the meat needed for such a big sandwich. If you love explosions and big cars you'll hate this review but:The Story of this Batman is not powerful enough to gain the Dramatic-Epic- Semishakesperean intentions of the second and third act.The joker is amazing cause he really makes you laugh at his cruelty, Comissioner Gordon demonstrates the admirable interpretation gamma of Mr Oldman but... what tires me after 2 hours?-the deep throaty voice of batman... after one hour is irritating... -the complex schemes and evil... after an hour are incomprehensive-the growing presence of extensive monologues on darkness and light...make you indifferent... complement and explaining an ongoing confusion... i can remind you... movies are mainly visual and you need a great craft for Shakespeare... the best example is the ""dog chasing cars"" text... great metaphor that survives a mass of intellectually rounded up script.I hope one day Clint Eastwood will interpret batman in the best batman story ever:the Dark Knight Returns(frank miller)... directed by David Lynch. And i'll take credit on that one for gos'd sake!! (A 60 year old batman returns to Gotham...)",0
"Given vouchers to experience ""Gold Class"" cinema, we ended up seeing this movie. I'm not really in comics state of mind so may be a little biased for starter. But my friends kids thought a lot of it and my wife wanted to see it so we went for it. I was not disappointed in my disappointment - Very loud, theatre shaking, story all over the place, dialog at time too soft for our ""seniors"" ears - I was thankful for the great comfort and the ""Sunday"" that turned up half way through the screening. Perhaps all these kind of movies should be shown only on Gold Class, at least you get other things to enjoy, and if by chance you like it you're really in for a great outing then. I'm very found of Heath Ledger, and like many will miss him dearly - Although he did a very good job with his role, I sincerely hope that it is not how people will remember him. I enjoyed some other older but famous actors, even if I thought they weren't doing themselves a professional favor. But as goes the saying it takes all kinds, only a few days ago I saw a guy on TV that had screwed little still horns on his head and wanted to upgrade this with, if I remember right, real bull horns. He was very rational about it and explained himself to the audience in a very intelligent and educated manners. So when I read the comments here that by the default were sorted by ""Best"". As such there were some ecstatic comments written with the full power of the English language. This was very impressive. However, since my feelings weren't so inclined towards this movie after reading some eloquent comments I switched the search to ""hated it"" (I was looking for ""worst"" but that what was available} and was ""pleasantly"" surprised to find equally well written comments very much relating to what I felt about this movie. There is no doubt people will like it had it has a lot in it in way of action and special effects. I would recommend it to people who don't feel the need to feed their brain with something more substantial. Yeah, I'm trying to be a snob MM",0
"I went to see Dark Knight despite not being big fan of comic genre. I think I was influenced with high media and public anticipation of the movie and maybe even with the fact that the Heath Ledger is in it. Anyway, as the movie started I watched first few scenes and realized this movie is not my cup of tea. I couldn't relate to the characters in any way and could not care about what they do. I think this comic movie is so serious and pretending to take place in a real world, and it didn't work for me. In the end, it is just movie about superheroes, so why so much reality? As the movie continued, I end up feeling bored and couldn't wait for the movie to finish. The story seemed to go nowhere with more explosion and chaos and I couldn't figure out what it is all about. In comparison, lately I saw Iron Man and this movie works with the genre and thrill me from start to end with the simple concept and limited subject matter, not trying too hard as the Dark Knight does.The positive thing about the Dark Knight for me is the acting. All actors give good performance, but it doesn't safe the movie.",0
It was an awfull movie!!!! i don't recommented at all,0
"First of all, they are trying to make this type of violence realistic in a dark, gritty intense type and the rating of this movie is rated PG-13? I have to disagree, TBH, they overdid this type of realistic violence into a permanently fearful rated-R type and it might caused fear into real-life 13-year-olds of either killing or getting killed along the way.Next, they made Harvey Dent act like a serious loud-mouth prosecutor and also proposed marriage to Rachel Dawes. But right after the Joker tricked Gordon, which led to Gordon turning down Dent too quick, Harvey grew worse than that Godfather character Michael Corleone type.Third of all, Joker did too many tricking violent deaths and especially killing Rachel Dawes by explosion automatically. Harvey screamed like a violent victim as he was transformed into Two-Face. The worse part is that he began violently scream and kill Gordon's crew members, like Michael Corleone did in the Godfather trilogy, and also threatened Gordon's son with both coin and gun because of both his lost-love of Rachel and his job at the same time. That scene of Two-Face threatening Gordon's son with both coin and gun should have force-changed TDK rating from PG-13 to R officially. If Two-Face threatened Gordon with both coin and gun instead of his son, then we don't have to change the TDK rating from PG-13 to R officially.Finally, that too much overdone rated-R type of fear in TDK may have additionally inserted in real-life Joker actor Heath Ledger's sleeping problems, which led to his death. That death of Heath's may have really caused TDK director Chris Nolan to suffer financial mental breakdown and panicked filming TDKR in a hap hazardous way.I disagree that the TDKR isn't that bad at all, even if you think TDKR isn't that great as TDK, I prefer the TDKR rather than the TDK because the TDKR violence is also dark, gritty and intense, but not fearfully overdone as TDK violence, even if the terrorism violence in TDKR is considered rated PG-13 type. One last word, none of the TDKR cast members aren't dead at all.",0
"Really this movie is wrong in every way it is an example of how not to tell a superhero movie placing it in reality is OK but then you are bound to the rules of reality and this movies applies superhero rules in reality(jumping on a car in the car park without breaking legs ??) And it also defies logic(henchmen who keep getting killed and still there is an ample supply of to fill the ranks,these guys must be dumb.) A villain who act contrary to what he proclaims he isn't funny(he is not chaos he acts to much like like an Einstein for that). needless sidetracks that lead to nothing(the whole bullet set-up). The philosophy 101 scenes that interrupt the flow of the movie just to make a point is so lame. The totally wooden acting from everyone except Ledger and Oldman(as if they edited all the worst takes of the other actors to give Ledger's performance some shine??) Setting is not Gothic it is dark techno-punk or tech-noir the city doesn't look like the city in Batman Begins(which was a great film). This part is not needed if you look at the three movies because it has nothing to do with the story-line of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises (Dent was not in BB and TDKR and Two-Face was killed in this movie and Rachel whose part had a different actress than BB is killed of and for the plot of TDKR Rachel is only needed to be reminded that she is dead ,and would not have waited for Bruce.) Even the Joker's performance isn't that great either but it stands out because all the other acting is wooden. I can continue about more things that annoy me about The Dark Knight but then I can write a page full of things.What surprised me what rating this got and that is too much for such a bad movies that tries to be two movies at once but fails at both of them. (and the raspy voice and way to prominent soundtrack)",0
"First of all, the joker died in the first movie. You can't bring someone back from the dead. The only reason why this movie was such a big deal is because Heath Ledger died. After watching the movie, I don't see how playing the part of the Joker would have drove him to die. Don't get me wrong. If he was the first Joker, then yea. He did a really good job. He wasn't the first and looked nothing like the first. I have nothing against the man. He was a great actor. But he had problems of his own and to say that he died because of the movie is a bunch of sh**t. Anyone could have played that part. I just feel that the media and the film makers, if they had a part in it, used the movie to cover up Heath's problems which in return made this movie out to be something so crazy when really it wasn't. I bought the movie and now I wish I wouldn't have. The true fans of the original Batman and Joker I think would have to agree that the movie was OK but that's all it was. Just OK.",0
"This might be a useful review for other folks like me who saw the movie, but are not typical action/comic book movie fans. I went in not expecting this to be my kind of film; for fans of this genre, it will admittedly rate higher.Firstly, Chicago looked great in this film. Gotham, and its look and feel, is as important as any character in the film. Chicago's architecture was wonderfully suited to this film.Heath Ledger was brilliant. The rotting stench of human decay poured over his putrid yellow teeth and through the screen right into my seat. He brought an energy and interest to every scene he was in, and the other characters were made more interesting wherever they interacted with him. Watching his performance, I felt the tragedy of Heath's death all over again.The movie is too long - I found that its extraordinary length ultimately diluted the impact of the story. And I was frustrated that with such a long movie, there wasn't more good storytelling, so much as there was a lot of complicated and over-wrought action scenes. The fight between good and evil is the oldest story, and I needed more to make it one I could really care about.Here are my thoughts: 1. Heath Ledger's Joker was brilliant. The character, the costume, the atmosphere he created - he was completely engaging and completely repulsive at the same time. But who was he really? There is no back story, other than the Joker's various versions of his past. Did he truly spring into Gotham having never before made an appearance? I wanted to understand him as more than a plot device to forward the Batman story.2. Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne feels wooden and heavy. We 'know' how he feels, but don't actually feel any of it. He seems overwhelmed with the burden of being the last defense against evil, and his character and the story are both suffused with this heaviness. I wanted to see more of his own spirit and conviction at work, instead of his inevitable resignation at being 'the Batman.' 3. So many philosophical/moral/spiritual issues were raised. Can you overcome evil without becoming evil? Can ordinary human goodness be heroic enough to combat evil? Is the ordinariness of people evil in its ordinariness? What is the impact of one agent of chaos on organized society? What do you lose by not destroying evil for the sake of goodness? Can society survive when the scales between good and evil are tipped in favor of evil? Lots of good questions, but questions that were overwhelmed with too many plot tricks and complications.4. I was frustrated that the ""truth teller"" in the movie was so completely evil. The Joker speaks a wise and unfiltered truth without fear and is willing to lose everything (much like Hannibal Lechter in Silence of the Lambs). While Alred the butler, and Morgan Freemen are clearly the conscience of Batman, they speak openly only to him, and then they say very little. The Joker is the only character of complete originality and creativity, crafting a world of his own design. I wanted Batman to offer us the same depth and insight. I wanted him to be energized and excited by the fight for good, just as the Joker is by chaos. 5. Aaron Eckhardt/Harvey Dent was initially a warm and three-dimensional character, ready to take the helm from Batman, so his decent into evil felt contrived, too quick and too predictable. Clearly he was broken hearted at Rachel's death, but it's not clear why his integrity, which stood strong against every other opposition, suddenly collapsed. I wanted to see his struggle, not just the evil that followed. 6. The acting by all was generally solid, but mostly uninteresting. I wasn't really pulled into the story and the only character that felt 'real' was the Joker. 7. The directing was generally solid, but action sequences and story line got muddled and overdone. I got lost again and again in over-long action sequences and in the incredible plot twists...suddenly the police commissioner has come back from the dead! But how? No explanation of this miraculous occurrence, and so I just felt shut-out of the story development.The Matrix proves you can mix action and philosophy, stories and special effects. I wanted to see a closer marriage of that here, but never felt the divergent elements of the film working together to truly support the underlying message.",0
"I just came back from the movie and I quite wanted to like the movie. I was really looking forward to it. But I was pretty unimpressed to be honest. I get the prerelease hype, but I can't see why people aren't disappointed by the lack of style of this director, this Gotham, this Batman.I've liked Nolan's non-Bat related movies, particularly Memento and The Prestige. I think he has talent, but it isn't really coming through in these movies.The Gotham of this movie, basically is Chicago. But not even the memorable aspects of Chicago. It's just the tall buildings of corporate Chicago in broad overcast daylight. It could have been just about any generic place. This is a mistake for a story that hinges so much on it's mythology. Even Batman Begins had a more distinctive Gotham City which of course is nothing compared to Tim Burton's menacing and stylish as Hell metropolis.I agree with misgivings over Bale as Batman. Only, I have the opposite opinion. I think he does fine as Bateman (aka Bruce Wayne), and is somewhat laughable as Batman. The gravelly voice had me smirking a few times. They have actually added a lot of bass to the voice of Batman. Go back and listen to how he says ""Here!"" in the original Batman Begins ads. It is distinctly higher and softer than the voice you get in the two movies. In fact that sound of that line changes in each of the trailers for Batman Begins.Does Gary Oldman wonder why he is in this movie? There is nothing about the character he is playing that particularly requires his talent as an actor. Same goes with Michael Caine, although I do like him, more-so in the first movie. I feel like they are both being underused in their scenes. I'll throw Morgan Freeman in on this as well. They are phoning in their performances with no complaints from their director.Kudos to Paul Giamatti as the Joker, though. He did an excellent job. Honestly I liked Heath Ledger's angle on the character, where it was allowed, but The Dark Knight's rating will not really allow for the character he was trying to give us, and as a result, I don't think it worked. I think Jack Nicholson gave a much more menacing character to be quite honest. It was a more tongue-in-cheek performance of course, but I think that actually worked in the favor of that particular character's menace. Jack didn't get to blow up buildings or do nearly as much psychotic stuff, though he had his share, and what he did, I think he did more effectively. I think this is more the director's fault, and the script's fault than it is Ledger's.Even if you ignore all that, the most important flaw to me was simply the messy jumble of a story. I felt like I saw two movies mixed together. The editing was awful.Finally, does anyone else find it odd that a movie about Batman doesn't have a single bat in it? To most, apparently, that isn't a major thing. To me it is indicative of the lack of consideration of the mythology apparent throughout this gazallion dollar franchise.",0
"Upon watching the film I did not enjoy it whatsoever. It lacked a decent plot, it went far below the standards for superhero movies, and I can't understand why it's regarded as being the best superhero movie of all time. Sure, the action was mildly good, but the costumes? Oh, the costumes. They looked like they came from the $5 and below Halloween costume store down the street. This movie is awful, AWFUL, and I cannot stand it. Even Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice are better than this, and that's saying something. Hell, Iron Man 2 is better than this! I'm done, this is a horrible movie. Do not recommend watching.",0
"I just saw it. This is the most horrible movie i have ever seen. Please don't waste your time. The story makes no sense. The characters are stiff like frozen cucumbers, the purpose and motivations are completely ridiculous. This is a disgrace of a movie. It is as if the director wanted to create the antibatman. Oh My God! Oh My Buddha! Wasted life! There is no logic, the characters are half-dimensional, the star is beyond ridiculous and annoying, the joker is on drugs, the pace is awful they jump from scene to scene like monkeys jump from tree to tree. The director clearly had no vision. I don't know what to say other than STAY AWAY. STAY AWAY.",0
This movie was so hyped for no reason and so boring everyone I talk to told me that it was OK but kind of boring this is the same answer I get from people I don't even know now that I think about it know it's kind of like breaking bad someone said it was great so everyone else saids it two beuase they heard the talk from one source it was interesting but don't watch it if your kind of tired it will put you right to sleep just like breaking bad if you have sleeping problems Breaking bad and this movie are the cure and I still think even though the 90 batmans are stuipd they are close to the comic books that we all read unlike this movie which is the exact thing and who ever said dark is realistic I live in arizona it's bright all the time maybe in Alaska that would be realistic in my lifetime there are nothing but colors that surround me so who ever said that is a idiot .,0
"I rated this movie 1/10 cause it's rated 8.9/10 . The film was boring,ruined 2 hours and lead to my 1st IMDb comment. The whole story revolves on 3 incident and they go like ""Joker strikes -batman saves , again Joker strikes - batman saves"" and judging by the fact that it was rated 8.5 when I watched this movie I was expecting kick ass T2. And all I got was a 2 Face(My fav. in the anime series) who is portrayed by a dumb ass who lacks any kind of style whatsoever and looks like sh1t even before he burned his face. A reasonable rating for this film would be a 7.5/10.Look for the movies it beat in Top 100 List and surely doesn't belong there.And when you've watched it,you'll come back writing one comment of your own. Peace.",0
"Now before i start i must first say i am no huge fan of the batman films and i have never seen Batman begins however after going to the cinemas to watch this film i was surprised how good it is, i mean the Joker did the best acting there was, and he was kind of funny however I'm afraid that was the only guy that did amazing.Christian Bale did very good and I'm looking forward to his next film, TERMINATOR 4 SALVATION however i thought his deep voice in TDN was a little bad..Why did it have to be so bad of a voice? Anyway forget the voice, its a good film but for the time it lasts 2:30 hours? It could of been shorter and just as good.But yeah 7/10 I recommend this film to anyone however it isn't one of my favourites.Why so serious? ;)",0
"I was really expecting a lot more for this movie and it looks like some company is paying for good comments around and I can't understand the good comments here either, it doesn't make any sense to me.The movie is too long, full of fragile dialogs such as the one where Bruce Wayne attempts to give up from Batman in order to save people from the Joker. Not to mention one of the last scenes where the joker is captured by Batman after Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox have traced the communication of all cell phones in Gothan city. Really terrible.I would say that DC comics and Warner Bros did not learn how to produce good Batman movies yet, which is really sad since Marvel does good movies quite often. It's also really sad because people like me (and several other people around) who really like Batman, are often wasting their money with poor movies like The Dark Knight.BTW, not sure why they chose this name for the movie, I was hoping that one day we could have a film with the original story written by Frank Miller but now that WB has used (burned) this name with such a bad movie I have no more hopes.",0
"Heath Ledger gives a great performance as the legendary Joker. He is funny and scary; all maniacal as he corrupts/kills people. Despite this, whenever he is not onscreen we deal with crappy Batman performance by Christian Bale who sounds like he needs Halls for his throat along with a sappy love triangle. Two-Face appears in the movie but he is killed almost immediately and thus a waste of a great villain. The film tries to be cutting edge via references to the US War on Terror and government surveillance but this not only makes the movie look like it was trying too hard but also makes the movie look dated. Batman and Robin, as silly as that movie was, aged better by at least being a comedy! The stupidity of the ending with Batman taking the blame for Harvey's could have been avoided if by simply blaming it on the Joker since it was technically his fault anyway and Alfred being against tracking the Joker by mass hacking people's cell phones is stupid and just a shoe-horned reference to US government spying at the time. This movie could have been great but the only thing great about the movie is Heath Ledger's performance.",0
"Batman. Pause and think about that character for a minute.
""The Batman"" is a guy in a spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is ""the Joker"", a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely, utterly seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc",0
"After Spielberg's introduction of humor to serious thriller with Jaws in 1974, his derivatives quickly changed cinema forever. Distilling his easy and life-like approach towards storytelling to the technique now known as 'comic relief' violent, serious or simply unappealing movies could now be made digestible for a broader audience by inserting random bits of comedy after stressful scenes. One of the big advantages of this method was also that it seemed to work even without putting much thought into it. You don't need a genius to do it. A stupid oneliner here, some odd physical comedy there and you can get even the most sensitive viewer trough a movie that can still be marketed towards an action oriented audience. What this has resulted in of course was, that making high- budget movies without elements of comedy now became a bad business decision and it became more and more rare that you could sit trough a piece of high caliber cinema without having to endure idiotic jokes and tasteless characters, often ruining crucial parts of an otherwise promising flick. One can not go about writing about this without mentioning infamous entities like the Jar-Jar Bings character from Star Wars: Episode One, Rob Schneider in Judge Dredd or Michael Bay's over the top ideas, often crossbreeding vicious melodrama with borderline cases of slapstick.Cinema is about what the audience wants and the audiences kept supporting this so comic relief kept ruining cinema for the last few decades. But you can only go so far (though this was somewhat more then far) and at some point stuff had to change. Sequels repeatedly promising a 'darker' more 'character centered' tone while dishing out the same topsy-turvy bullsh*t again and again kept loosing credibility and someone finally had to deliver. One year after Spider-man 3 and it's infamous emo-Peter-fever-dance-scene Nolan Presented the first 'serious' blockbuster for nearly a decade and brought about a revolution in mainstream cinema. Sounds cool? Just give me a few more minutes.The concept of Nolan's Batman is to switch bat-nipples to army gadgets, pull back on stupid comedy, give the main character something that can be called a background story, motivation, introduce a 'philosophical' aspect and basically place Batman into the real world as compared to la-la-lala-land where Sam Raimy's Spider-man lives together with Michael Bay on the back of a purple dinosaur.And all of this is really cool but wait a second, what about the box office? Wouldn't that mean that people need to THINK to grasp all this? How would this complex approach not frustrate the average moviegoer? How would Bruce Wayne's inability to express love, the Joker's hedonistic psychopathy not startle young mothers who go to the movies for fun and delight and like to enjoy movies together with the whole family? Nolan's got the key.Movies can be serious. They just has to be dumb as sh*t.It was a misunderstanding all along and Nolan (accidentally?)figured it out. It's not about the stress (in fact people love stress, isn't this the whole point of drama?). It's about the intellectual challenge. People want smart movies and they want serious movies, but not smart and serious like smart and serious. Smart and serious compared to their own abilities. That means on the average the intellectual abilities of what used to be a 13 year old way back when.So present all the deepness, complicatedness, motivations and this on the lowest, dumbest, most childish level that is possible so every idiot can understand and then put trillions of dollars into making it look like something big and then start viscerally overstimulating the viewers by having a severe score blare all the f*cking time and the tons and tons of dumb, shallow bullsh*t will sound like Dostojewsky because there was the really heavy music and they said it with this deep voice and they were sitting in this incredibly expensive setting, it has to be profound. Hell, they might even feel a bit profound themselves now, after all there is profound written all over this movie and it's dark, serious looking posters and you have to be a profound guy to enjoy a profound movie. They won't care, that it's pretentious, that it's shallow and infantile, they don't even know what those words mean.So this movie is on kindergarten level. It's not that there is nothing good about it, some of it is high quality stuff but it's a stupid, childish, shallow, phoney melodrama, it's overly long, extremely self- important and the production value is exactly the trick that makes it to be taken serious and therefore so harmful. It works because audiences are stupid and fall for everything flashy and loud and expensive looking, cause they are mainly teenagers and mainly Americans and because people love marketing and movies are only about marketing now.But the problem is not that Nolan made a phoney movie, it's that he brought about a new revolution in mainstream cinema, as now it is the bad business decision not to have low-level, pseudo-philosophical bullsh*t in high-budget movies and flicks like X- Men: First Class, the god awful Spider-Man reboot, Prometheus and many others already adopted his mind bogglingly boring, anti-intellectual approach centered around infantile conversation and now make more money then ever. Nolan ruined mainstream sci-fi and superhero movies at least for the next decade and the thing in which his misdeed is truly severe as compared to Spielberg's case above mentioned is, that he has shown people how to do the tasteless version right away, rather then just having invented something cool which the capitalist world then abused for it's own merit. He did the sh*tty thing right away, god forbid those studios have to figure it out for themselves.Thank you Mr. Nolan. 4/10",0
"oh, what a travesty! i was pretty jacked up to see this, but it failed on a number of fronts. definitely, Ledger's work was admirable, as was all the work of the estimable cast, but nothing could save the poor, poor directorship/editing of this abysmal cookie-cutter, video-game, i-don't-know-what of a movie... what a disappointment! i can't blv what an appalling lack of understanding of story-telling the director (C. Nolan) showed, after such brilliant work as ""Memento"", etc.; i can't blv it's the same guy! honestly, i fwd'd through the last 1/3 of the movie... was it really just 2 1/2 hours? and i LOVE long movies, as long as they use the time to develop character/plot/etc... but this was just such a mish-mash of images, effects, bla-bla-bla, that i couldn't care less, as much as i wanted to respect Ledger's last work. what a shame. 9 out of 10 stars, on average?!? ugh. i think we've got a generation raised on video-games, unable to distinguish between flashy scenes of fire and throatily-delivered dialogue and true, developed story. sigh..... :(",0
"The movie isn't too much of a blockbuster or anything unique if you took out two face, and the Joker from the equation. It has gotten so boring that the second viewing, I simply can't watch it (unwatchable) that I simply had to fast forward and just look at The Joker. In fact the beginning of the movie, that begins with the robbery is just too much of cliché. Surprise me! This followed by ho hum Bruce Wayne talking to his Butler, and other parts are just humdrum. The only reason why the movie's rating are so high in a 5 minute scene where the Batman interrogates the psychopathic Joker. I think the best part of the movie is actually the makeup artist that makes the Dark Knight like Friday the 13th. In all fairness, this is the only installment of Batman that gives that look and feel of a flick B movie horror, instead of a blockbuster, which I believe a 9.1 IMDb Rating(November 2008)is just a passing fad. I guarantee that it isn't as gripping as The Godfather. A really good dark Batman I believe is the early installment of Batman with the Penguin, which is quite dark. That baby scene when the baby was abandoned into the river and float on one very dark night allowed to float away by their parents just still haunts me. Perhaps the reason why The Dark Knight is highly overrated is the very sad passing away of a really brilliant and promising actor, Heath Ledger. Aside from that, Two face played a fairly good scene, although, I still believe The Oscars should be given to the makeup artist (much like the move The Fly) to give it a look and feel of the only horror movie genre in the Batman series. What the studios are doing I believe is to redefine who is Batman, into horror and psycho (but they didn't they only looked at Joker and Two face completely IGNORING Batman), such as James Bond in Casino Royale, into more meaty type movie such as The Scorpion King genre. I think people today simply got sick and tired of all the polished CGIs and wanted to move to more reality type show, more meat (ala Casino Royale), more horror (ala The Walking Dead) type of movie. In all fairness, the story and directing is woefully sleepy (if it hadn't been for the Joker Scene during interrogation or his blood curdling description of a knife cutting up a smile), it really resembles the same bore I have received watching Angelina Jolie, Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life. Sure all the action sequences are there, but it has been done with outright cliché, that you can just go to sleep as the men jumped from building to building using a wire. Oh I seen that before, I think it was in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, played by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Give me a break. Killing the robbers amongst themselves to reduce their share loot is a stale cookies. Do something different! Batman in this movie needs to be a little maniacal or extreme obsession in getting the criminals, that was the key missing issue in this movie. The other thing I would like to see added is hallucinations of dead innocent people, his father, mother, and perhaps his deadly madness for revenge. This would add a little flavor to the vanilla type Batman. If the directors have lack of imagination, learn that a Batman can have the same craze personality and scenery as that of American Psycho that Christian Bale played in. Haven't anybody learned? At least that would give it a kick. Still, personality aside, the plots and story lines doesn't have the twist and turns and emotional element filled atmosphere as that of The Negotiator, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The movie needs to have a more convincing story line. Sure, Mafia are competing for territories and robbery is spoiled by Batman. Gee, what else is new. The basic story premise should be changed when the police are the real mafia who used Batman for their own gains would have been more exciting along the lines of ""The Departed"" played well by Leonardo DeCaprio. I keep the best for last: the best movies anyone can make is an outstanding premise of the story. The premise of this story is simply Joker wanting to rid of Batman because he is interfering with crime, isn't an interesting premise. It's hardly an interesting story to begin with. Try a more interesting premise: Batman is being used by the police force so that Joker can monopolize the criminal gang warfare. But his methods are psychopathic and strings of ""Jack the Ripper"" type horrific murder. Isn't that a nicer premise. Greeks teaches the importance of a good story is the plot. Well the Premise is even more important the plots because the premise is the guiding light to the entire plot of the story.",0
"I had the luxury of seeing Dark Knight when it first hit theaters this week and let me tell you, I was quite disappointed.I do not understand what the rave reviews are about but I found the plot line very complicated and confusing most times. Jumping from here to there, pushing far too much for a nearly 3 hour movie. Heath Ledger is an excellent actor of course but I found Nolan's version of Joker very demented and nothing like the comic book Joker or cartoons. He seemed like a mental patient then the Joker I grew up reading. Where were the jokes and the twisted sense of humor? The only thing they left was the menacing laugh which Ledger did fantastically.While I love watching Superheros, there just wasn't enough Batman. The whole movie focused a lot on the Harvey Dent character, who in my opinion should have been left for the third installment. It was already enough to have Joker as the villain, but Two-Face too? The development of Two-Face was quick as it ended. And his agenda was too poor to be believable as to why he was the classic Two-Face Batman fans know of.Batman himself was ho-hum. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, but as batman? No. That voice he puts on which supposedly was to be menacing came up more constipated and very forced. You could barely hear his dialog along with his spit fly out of his mouth occasionally. However, I did enjoy his fighting, which was downright how I see Batman fight the big baddies. But the main thing that bothered me most on whole that was missing was the Batmobile. I have no idea what Nolan was thinking to not include it in the movie. It was the main reasons I wanted to see it in the first place. Not to mention his classic domain, the Batcave, which was replaced with an underground high-tech warehouse. Not impressive.Overall, the movie was just too long, too complicated and forgettable. I favor Tim Burton's Batman over Nolan's version by a long shot. But then, everyone has their own opinion.4/10.",0
"It was a good movie, but it wasn't as spectacular or amazing as everyone has been saying it would be.You should see this in the cinemas, but only because the quality of the film just wouldn't be there if you got it out on DVD.Not a good film for the children, good for teenagers/adults and anyone familiar with the batman franchise.If you have not seen the first movie then there are several places in The Dark Knight where you will get a bit confused as they add in references and it is assumed you have seen the first film.End result? See it in the movies, before you go watch Batman Returns, try not to read reviews done by professional film critics as that could ruin the movie for you.",0
"The biggest mistake this trilogy made was to meld the comic book craziness with real life logic in the hope of making a gritty, realistic Batman. News Flash: The comic Batman is totally and utterly unrealistic. You either create a decent comic film, or you take only elements that can generally work in the real world. This trilogy tried to create some kind of hybrid and, because of that, it falls flat on its face. But even the parts that should be believable regardless are done badly - like the police force. In order to make the joker a super- villain, Nolan made everyone else a super-moron. LAZY WRITING",0
"I really have to give this movie a low rating. I didn't want to at first, but I must. And here's why.The annoying recasting of actors didn't prove well, because the actors are very highly irritating and HORRIBLE at acting. Not to mention they look like really mean people. Plastics if you will, plastic being a term from Mean Girls (a Lindsay Lohan movie) if you've seen it. Every girl is a plastic in the movie. Rachel Dawes was recasted, I don't get why. You just killed half the movie by making it not about Christian Bale and Katie Holmes, but about MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL? What was the thought process? And recasting Scarecrow? Are you serious? It's not buyable as a Batman Begins sequel after you've taken those two out.And plus, this may anger the ""fans"", but Heath Ledger really wasn't that good as the joker. And no, I am not a Jack Nicholson fanboy. He just wasn't good. Not to say if he tried again with the right guidance he wouldn't be good. He's just too normal to be honest. You think that he's so different, but all our kids from the 90s were like that. My dad used to be like that with me to make me laugh in the morning before school. I've seen peoples pets that are crazy like him. Although not violent of course, but what he got accredited for was the wide eyed psychopathic look, but it looks all normal if you ask me. I'm like that all the time. Well sort of anyway lol.Next? Well the movie is too much of a cop movie. Right off the bat (no pun intended) it didn't have a Batman Begins feel. Too much about rednecks trying to do the whole Law and Order storyline. Batman Begins was not about ""the police"". It was about seeing the ninjas, samurais, superheroes and stuff clobbering 50 million bad guys. NOT seeing the weak Gotham police force trying to solve crimes. The whole thing is about Batman just solving things, there was never an actual story. The first one was EPIC, there was actually a story to follow. This time around, it was storyless. Literally. You're just watching collections of different things happen, there's nothing connecting it. It's an episode of CSI, that's all.We had a beautiful martial artist Ducard in the first movie who was like Qui Gon Jinn in Star Wars, expertly trained. But this time we don't really get anything. All the fight choreography was lame. If you count him bending a gun as being ""choreography"" then sadly you're mistaken, that's not much of a choreograph. It's just a cool feat to add into a scene, like sprinkles on ice cream. The cinematography for the fight scenes was just okay as well. Sure you could see more than in Batman Begins, but the fighting moves THEMSELVES sucked.The music was cool at least and sure, it had some good moments. But it's not really that good of a movie. Big disappointment.1/10!",0
"Advance said it was darker than ""Begins"". I'd say bleak was more the tone. Certainly the Joker was much more psychotic than Nicholsons', which was the clearly the intent of the producers, so I guess if you see that as reality, it works; this is a comic book, so how real can it be? But the psychological monologues by Ledger got to be rather tedious. Not that he didn't deliver them well, sort of a modern day Hamlet musings, but without the clever word play. But after one or two, we got the point, he was a murderous psycho, I don't think we needed it drummed into us. Compared to Hopkins Lecter, or Perkins Psycho it was pale. If Ledger had not unfortunately died, I don't think you'd have had the adulation that's been bestowed on his performance.And Dent this ""white knight"", this hero that Gotham so desperately needs, suddenly becomes a psychopathic murderer because the Joker spends 5 minutes with him and one of his psycho monologues; a bit hard to swallow. And rather than take the memory of this beacon of hope from Gotham, Batman takes the rap for Dents killings. Please, why? Easily explained by his own terrible lose, why would that shatter Gothams hopes? And Dents Two-Face was like a T1 in flesh. Amazing how muscles can still work with no blood supply.But the real killer for me was the explosives on the ferries. After the Joker threatens to bomb the bridges/tunnels out of Gotham, no one on the police force thinks to check the ferries for bombs? A blind man would have noticed the dozens of 55 gallon drums of fuel oil and fertilizer aboard each ferry. To get all these on board, the Joker would have had to have an army of helpers and no one noticed? This was as dumb a storyline as you'd find in an Ed Wood film.On the plus side the action was good. Fight scenes were hard to follow as it seem like they mounted the camera on an actors arm, but the special effects were good.",0
"I enjoyed the movie, until the last scene, when they decided to hide the truth about Harvey, it really change my opinion about the movie, because what I care about is the purpose, the main idea. The solution offered in this movie is very bad, showing this idea in public, in the cinema as a good idea is the worst thing to do. Hiding the truth is something that keeps destroying our faith in each other, our trust in the closest people to us, it's destroying the societies all around the world, in every nation. It's something we should fight and not encourage. So what if the White Knight couldn't keep his word? he is a human being and part of being a human being is making mistakes. I think there is a lot better end for this movie, an idea that completes the greatness of the story and the show. The White Kngiht falls and feel sorry about it, he lives and serves time while writing a book about ideals and about how the man loses himself, that book will encourage another lawman to become the next white knight who learned from the mistakes of Harvey. This way the next movie will be about the adventures of the new white knight.",0
Batman Begin was and still is the best in the series. I was disappointed in this sequel to begin. The whole movie was pretty dark and depressing. The joker character is kind of weak. I just can't see how batman have such a weak nemesis. It's a movie that tries to provide insight into a mind that is free from the emotional shackle and control of modern society and test the endurance of human character but fell short of what it tried to achieve and in the end felt like the action/plot didn't flow like the previous with numerous boring scenes. I'm not even going to bother providing details as it's disappointing to watch the sequel. Now I have my fingers crossed for the Casino Royale sequel Quantum of Solace. Casino Royale was and is the best Bond yet. I hope Quantum will not disappoint like this one. I am so glad Daniel and Eva are back and I am a fan of Olga who was in the movie Hit-man.,0
"Good film but lacked depth. Sad performance from the Joker who never really lived to be the psycho the character deserved. Lack of blood and gore made this a family movie which a attempted dark tinge.The jokers character never really developed well enough, this was my primary disappointment, and seemed to just disappear in the end without a fight. Awful end scene in which a sonar device is developed that can track cellphone owners.Possibly the worst special effects/makeup was that of two-face, he looked like some sort of robot from the terminator movies and never really seemed a threat. Just a bit desperate.Sad sad sad sequel that promised so much.On a positive Batman was played well as was the butler",0
"So - saw the Batman movie last night. Don't know what all the hype is about. Seemed to drag on and on and I would not want to see it again. It was an OK Flick - but like I said Duh - what's all the hype about. Nicholson was a much better Joker IMHO as was Keaton a much better Batman and in the final analysis I think they were both more believable. I liked the Batman toys in the Keaton movie a bazillion times better than the over-sized armoured quad and ex army gear they use in these movies. I feel like there is a sickness in peoples minds that they seem to enjoy the over the top misery , murder , mayhem and general psychosis that pervades this version of Batman. I look at the quotes here on IMDb and think ""OH MY !! - you think that is amusing !!??"".",0
"Being a huge fan of Batman Begins (10/10!) I was as excited as any movie lover for The Dark Knight. And when the hype built up to a historic point, I was PSYCHED, man! I couldn't wait! So now, afterwards, I wonder what went wrong. I wonder if I've just seen too many superhero and action movies and I've been desensitized by them, or if I'm just insane (or stupid) for being a 20-year-old who didn't adore The Dark Knight.From the beginning, something struck me as being a little off. The character of Batman/Bruce Wayne was not the same. He lacked the inner turmoil and the depth that we saw in the first movie. Not only this, but the film itself seemed to lack depth. None of the major themes of the movie came up until about an hour into it. I also could not ignore the sickening camera movements and use of music... Two characters would be having a relatively calm and simple conversation, and the camera would circle around them and fly every which way. Meanwhile, the music score sounds like it was misplaced, and it should be accompanying a fight scene. I think this complaint is just an example of what I found generally sickening about the Dark Knight. It takes all the techniques deemed effective in a modern action/suspense movie, and it piles them on to the point of exhaustion. I'm not just talking about the technical aspects of the film. It just fails to overstep the bounds of its genre. It's chock full of suspenseful (but old) little tricks and plot devices- dead characters suddenly appearing alive, events that have the sole purpose of giving the viewer a jolt (like the body smashing into the window), ridiculously high-tech equipment, villains who are complete geniuses with explosives and who force the main character to choose between two people he loves. I could go on if I thought a little bit harder.The gaudy style is a lesser tragedy than how dumbed down this movie is, though. In Batman Begins (Some might say it's unfair to compare the two movies... Well, I say it's not. This is a sequel to Batman Begins) there is plenty more to digest than what meets the eye. The viewer is treated to an amazing transformation of a man, thanks to the conquering of his greatest fears. The message was crystal clear, and it was amazingly thoughtful for a comic book movie. The Dark Knight, unfortunately, doesn't get very far past its identity as a comic book movie, giving us the usual ""moral dilemma"", ""right and wrong"", ""Am I going too far?"" stuff that I honestly don't find that interesting, because, how many of us have to decide on a daily basis whether or not it's right to kill some one who has killed? It sure hasn't happened to me lately. We all face fear, and that's why Batman Begins is so engaging. It has appeal as something other- something MORE- than a comic book movie. The Dark Knight does not.And now for the little things that I couldn't figure out how to put smoothly in a paragraph. There were definitely problems with the plot. Certain elements of the story seemed to disappear, or weren't resolved properly. Take, for instance, the phony Batmans. What happened to them? No one knows. I don't remember any resolution for that. Also, the whole subplot with the mob annoyed me, in general. It seemed as if it shouldn't have existed; or at least, its role in this film was much too big. The only point it seemed to have was as something for Harvey Dent to attack to show how powerful he was. Why does the Joker come up to them and make a proposition with them? They turn it down, and ultimately, nothing comes out of the whole thing. Also, the scene where Batman crashes his motorcycle in order to avoid killing the Joker, and then when he saves him from falling- that was PATHETIC. The standard superhero schlock of letting the bad guy go- in this case, one of the most convincingly evil and sadistic bad guys EVER. This movie could've had so much more kick if he had just manned up and killed him. How awesome would that have been? But no, of course it has to abide by the freaking superhero code. Sad.Oh, but wait, there were good things about this movie! I did give it a 6 out of 10, you know. After all the negative things I've typed, it seems like I would have to type just as much positive stuff to justify my rating. But no, I can do so in just two sentences (one is a fragment, actually). 1: I was entertained. 2: The Joker. As far as 1 is concerned: despite all the things about this film that bugged me and made me think ill of it, it still got to whatever part of my brain it is that makes me enjoy stuff. Like I said, I AM 20 years old, and I'm also male, and certain things are just highly enjoyable to me and most people of my age and I can't really say why. Well, the Dark Knight is overflowing with those things. There's people falling off buildings, people getting thrown off fire escapes, senseless betrayal, trickery (The hostages! awesome), truck chases, Morgan Freeman, and obviously, explosions. The list goes on. Yes, these things were entertaining and enjoyable, but they don't redeem the bad qualities of the film at all. They just make it watchable- perhaps even rewatchable. As far as 2 is concerned: Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar nomination. It helps that his character was written to PERFECTION, of course, but Heath was really something else. The voice, the tongue thing, the walk- everything about the Joker just oozed chaos and anarchy. If I see this movie again, I'll probably space off whenever he's not on screen.",0
"I really don't get the gist with Batman films. If I'm honest I think all are a let down. This one is OK, pretty standard Hollywood superhero film. Some good actors doing an alright job but nothing spectacular. This movies is always in the top 5 films of all time which I just don't get?If you want to be entertained for a few hours this will do the job but it isn't anything special.Maybe I'm missing something ?????The best batman was the first and that at best was average.Light entertainment I guess??",0
"This movie is really overrated. I mean, it was okay, but the casting choice was poorly made and the characters were horrible. I expected much more from Christopher Nolan. Batman sounded like he had throat cancer. Bale looked nothing like Bruce. The Joker's origins were messed up and he was weird. He was something like ""Hey Bats I know I have just met you, but what would I do without you? I can't live without you."" So overrated. Batman V Superman may not have included those many characters, but it was better. I was really expecting much more because Nolan is a great director and also lots of people were really praising the movie. This is my opinion.",0
"The only reason I give this movie a three is because the portrayal of the joker was interesting. Even then, it wasn't a faithful portrayal. A fresh take, yes. The other installments to the series, I gave a 1. As a fan of the 80's cartoon, I am dismayed by the success of these movies. Batman's voice is stupid and laughable. It isn't cool. He isn't cool. This franchise tries way too hard and fails. The cell phone eyes? that was retarded. The fact that he has some other guy make most of his gadgets is insulting to the source material. He in no way comes across a great detective or even that smart. In fact, he's pretty stupid in these movies. All the characters other than the joker are bland. This is terrible, as Batman is one of the most interesting super heroes. I did not like their version of Alfred at all. It isn't Alfred. It's just Michael Caine playing himself. And in the later installment, they even managed to make Robin boring. He's suppose to be the lighthearted element! There is little to no humor, which I think is one of the main factors contributing to the why these movies and it's characters seem so bland and contrived. The action...? Bland and forgettable as well. If I wasn't familiar with the cartoon series, I would have already forgotten about this movie and who everyone is. I think the only reason this rates higher than Thor the Dark World is because Batman is a better known, more popular character originally. They came so deceivingly close to making a suitable Batman, that they clearly fooled millions. Well I am here to speak to those less desperate ones with clearer heads. These movies are an over-hyped disappointment. By trying to make Batman ""more realistic"" they took away the fantastic film noir theme that the world's greatest detective deserves. They turned an intelligent and intimidating character into a unintelligible dimwit with some lackluster fighting skills and a cowl. Any other super hero could outwit and overpower this interpretation of the caped crusader. Dc should just stick to TV and stop messing up their own characters on the big screen. The end.",0
"You know why everyone loves this movie its because of the serious close to early Batman(minus the pink gloves)and its refusal to make a funny character funny. Yes the actual Batman comics are dark and Heath Ledger and Morgan Freeman are the only two good actors in the movie but they screwed up the BIGGEST aspect of the Joker.While yes he is crazy and terrifying, he also needs to be funny!!! When Bat mans stale and has a stupid voice Two face is shoved in and is generic and the Joker is boring generic crazy guy who makes jokes that don't have a good punch line. But hey Im the kind of guy the would must rather listen to Mark Hammel instead.",0
"you know this was good but I'm not gonna get m-ICE-self too ex-ICE-ted over it. Batman man should go to the doctor because he sounds like he vo-COLD- chords are going to freeze over soon. Ice-till think that Arnie was the coolest Batman villain around. There's snow-way that Heath Ledger did it better. The villain wasn't even compelling, he was a total Joker. I found his character to be cold and un-burrr-able. Batman doesn't have a sidekick in this movie, and without his acompl-ice it really is much less interesting. The chase scene is a blizzard of confusion at best, it doesn't follow any coh-ice-I've storyline. This movie is naïve and juvenile at best, it really is a movie for chill-dren. I mean, when Heath Ledger is robbing the bank, wouldn't someone have cold the police? There's snow way that the school bus wouldn't be noticed leaving the bank. Ice still don't know why people like the movie, the disorganization of the police force is something I would never tolerate during my time as Governor of California.",0
"Good performances, but so full of plot holes and i felt the jeapoardy was false. Similar to Skyfall the baddie is supposed to know everything, even random choices made by the characters",0
"I felt the script of the movie little thought, could have risked a more interesting story. The film has few acts",0
"I liked it at first it kept with the dark tone from the previous film and it felt like I was going to really enjoy it almost as much as I did the previous film but then in came Joker and ruined it...Heath Ledger's performance was absolutely brilliant especially after seeing his earlier works but what Christopher Nolan and the rest of the Dark Knight Trilogy crew did with the Joker was ironically enough a complete and utter joke, the Joker doesn't wear makeup he has had his skin bleached and his hair turned green from falling into a vat of chemicals I did not like what they did with the Joker.two-Faces rise to insanity was awesome however I didn't like the fact they killed him off after all he could have returned for a cameo or something in the third film but they killed off such an iconic character.The triumphs in the movie were spectacular don't get me wrong I can enjoy this film now and again however it was the spectacular master piece Batman Beginning was and the failures of the film were more than the triumphs and they are so bad which is why I'm only giving this movie a 3/10 stars",0
"""The Dark Knight"" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.The key performance in the movie is by the late Heath Ledger, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since Peter Finch? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928). His clown's makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (Christian Bale), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. ""The Dark Knight"" slips around those defenses and engages us.Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.The plot involves nothing more or less than the Joker's attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batman' secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesn't know Batman's identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isn't the usual jabs and jests we're familiar with: It's psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on ""Memento"") has more depth and poetry than we might have expected.Two of the supporting characters are crucial to the action, and are played effortlessly by the great actors Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. Freeman, as the scientific genius Lucius Fox, is in charge of Bruce Wayne's underground headquarters, and makes an ethical objection to a method of eavesdropping on all of the citizens of Gotham City. His stand has current political implicstions. Caine is the faithful butler Alfred, who understands Wayne better than anybody, and makes a decision about a crucial letter.Nolan also directed the previous, and excellent, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), which went into greater detail than ever before about Bruce Wayne's origins and the reasons for his compulsions. Now it is the Joker's turn, although his past is handled entirely with dialogue, not flashbacks. There are no references to Batman's childhood, but we certainly remember it, and we realize that this conflict is between two adults who were twisted by childhood cruelty - one compensating by trying to do good, the other by trying to do evil. Perhaps they instinctively understand that themselves.Something fundamental seems to be happening in the upper realms of the comic-book movie. ""Spider-Man II"" (2004) may have defined the high point of the traditional film based on comic-book heroes. A movie like the new ""Hellboy II"" allows its director free rein for his fantastical visions. But now ""Iron Man"" and even more so ""The Dark Knight"" move the genre into deeper waters. They realize, as some comic-book readers instinctively do, that these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes. And the Batman legend, with its origins in film noir, is the most fruitful one for exploration.In his two Batman movies, Nolan has freed the character to be a canvas for a broader scope of human emotion. For Bruce Wayne is a deeply troubled man, let there be no doubt, and if ever in exile from his heroic role, it would not surprise me what he finds himself capable of doing.POPULAR BLOG POSTS",0

"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film.",0
"The biggest problem with this movie is that large parts are dedicated to a theme that has been done to death by the Left Wing Progressives of Hollywood. The absurd premise of this entire picture is that if you kill someone, no matter the justification, you yourself become the bad guy; it's cliché, it's worn out, and it's just not true. To someone who accepts this pseudo-philosophical garbage, the Dark Knight might have some sort of meaning, but to the rest of us, it's just a rather silly message that turns Batman into a gibbering do-gooder with both hands tied behind his back. I'd put my faith in David Cameron before the weak-ass Batman portrayed in this movie - and that's saying something.In the real world, a mass murdering psychopath would be hunted down and shot without any remorse whatsoever. No-one would care. There is no grey area here. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN REAL LIFE. IT IS LAWFULLY ACCEPTABLE, especially when the said murderer is in the MIDDLE OF A RAMPAGE. Instead, in Nolan's fantasy world, killing a despicable killer (even to save others) is a no-no. Batman would much rather keep his 'morality' intact by sparing the killer time and time again - even at the risk of his own life. There are numerous examples of Leftist propaganda in this film, and silly scenes that serve only to give the liberals a warm heart, like the serious criminal who decides to throw away the detonator in order to save innocent lives. GIVE ME A BREAK. I'm not buying that cliché drivel. It's time for Hollywood to enter the real world. This film is an apologist for criminality.How on earth has this garbage managed to fool so many people? Given that the main theme of the film is utterly flawed, you won't be surprised to learn that almost all of it is. Like all of the films in the Nolan trilogy, there are WAY too many inconsistencies, plot holes, and totally unbelievable situations. Batman Returns is largely more realistic than this film is, and it wasn't even trying to be realistic. THAT should give you a good idea of how bad this is. At least the fast-cut editing has been toned down a little from Batman Begins.The biggest mistake this trilogy made was to meld the comic book craziness with real life logic in the hope of making a gritty, realistic Batman. News Flash: The comic Batman is totally and utterly unrealistic. You either create a decent comic film, or you take only elements that can generally work in the real world. This trilogy tried to create some kind of hybrid and, because of that, it falls flat on its face. But even the parts that should be believable regardless are done badly - like the police force. In order to make the joker a super-villain, Nolan made everyone else a super-moron. LAZY WRITING.There's not enough space to expand on every point I've made, and the film throws another curve ball at you before the end: The main law maker himself has a 100% reversal into a super-villain, because the Joker killed his wife hahaha. As you can no doubt tell, the script is completely bonkers. If you are going for realism, then don't insult my intelligence with this crap, Nolan.Imho, the Dark Knight is the strongest of the three films, but it's still a giant mess. My rating: 5/10.",0
"well, it looks to me like the industry people got on IMDb and wrote glowing reviews of this film. Some problems with this movie: everyone in it is miserable. Is it too much for a story based on a comic book to have a little lightness in it? The Joker isn't funny, he's just sick. Why bother to have the Joker if he isn't funny? You may as well have some regular psycho. Ledger does a great job with the character, but it's not written well. - like the last Batman movie, the action sequences are long and things whiz by when you can't really see or tell what's happening. Also like the last movie, there are a huge number of explosions and big special effects, yawn. - There really isn't much to root for here. Bale is dour and boring as Bruce Wayne/Batman and the only halfway likable character in the film is the character played by Maggie Gyllenhal.",0
"This Review Contains SpoilersThe Dark Knight contains so many plot holes it was a joke. If there is one thing that I cant stand and thats poor writing. I know it is a comic book film but Batman Begins was so tightly written that I found it unbelievable that this one was written so poorly.1: The story with the Asian banker was so pointless. It added nothing to the plot. Just a cool looking extraction scene2: During the Bruce Wayne party, when The Joker enters with his goons and Bruce hides Dent, why wouldn't The Joker kill all the innocent people he now has. Think about it. Batman flys out the window to catch Rachel and leaves The Joker with all the guests at the party completely unprotected. The next scene just cuts to the next day, with no mention of the party. If the Joker was such a crazy, he would of killed everyone of the guests at the party. Or better still, would have used the hostages to negotiate the hand over of Dent.3: Why does Gordon fake his death. Just so he can drive a truck. What the hell. There's much easier ways to go into hiding.4: Why did Batman have so much faith in the fact the the people on the boat wouldn't blow each other up. If I was on that boat the criminals would have been a million little bits in about 3 seconds.5: How the hell did Bruce build the sonar machine. 6: If Dent was so angry about the death of Rachel, he would have killed the Joker in the hospital. I mean, come on.7: Why didn't Batman tell Dent at the end when he had Dents son that he was trying to save Rachel and not him. Tell him that the joker tricked him.8: And the best. Why did they blame Batman for the dead cops and civilians. Gordon is the commissioner he could have said the Joker did it and people would have believed it. The Joker held the city hostage so he certainly could have killed a few cops. It was such a ridiculous ending. Poor writing is not acceptable. They have years to write it and all of the above could have been fixed easily.",0
"The Dark Knight: A different 'plot' of view (Warning: Spoilers!) Movies are men made, there will always be errors and imperfections The Dark Knight is no exception. Its production quality was great, well directed and well acted but its plot was far from flaw less. I will not go as far as claiming it as a great movie without connecting that super hero context it was based up on.The biggest problem for Dark Knight's story originated from its realistic theme. Since unlike other Heroes, the caped knight has no super power. Equally, his enemies should have no super power either. Yet this Joker character in the Dark Knight has power beyond any super hero or villain: Power to defy logic! The new Batman series was praised for creating a world that is not like the one in the comics, it tries to be as real as possible. In short, it takes itself seriously as a normal movie! Therefore, I expect the plot to be logical and can pass the test of common sense.While the first half of the movie was excellent, though there was already a dent that foreshadows the problem that was to come: When the Joker crash the Wayne's party.This is the first time we saw Joker's super power at work. He walked in to the party from the gate. How would a few thugs with a leader that has face paint not be stopped at ground level of the building armed security guards that normally assign to guard a party attended by so many important people of the city? How would Master Bruce not be warned by his men beforehand when they are at the lobby? An army of private security would be storming in from every exit long before the Bat shows up! The joker and his men would never get away as cops would seal the building before a dramatic scene involving Rachel. One has to remember that just a few scenes ago, our hero Batman have to pull all sorts of high tech strings to get in a building in Hong Kong then get out. The Joker must have used his super power to stopped logic for him to walk out of the Bat's property.The Joker's super power gets overly charged in the second half of the movie. It all began after the poor judge got blow up in her car and the police chief gets poisoned, where the Joker puts a challenge to the Bat by abducting Rachel and Dent. It may seem smooth on the surface but if we think deeper, we would notice that, unless it was Joker's super power at work and resources rival Mr Wayne, both victims would never get abducted as they were snatch off the streets.We can pretend whatever happened in 2001 never happened in Gotham universe. But with two such important person killed a few scenes earlier, it spells open war between the gangs and law enforcement. Mr 'two faces to be' and Rachel who was working so closely with him and has connection with the Bat would be well protected by the good police and the Bat's high tech devices if I was writing the plot. As smart as Rachel's character was, she should know better not to leave the watchful eye of the Bat until the crisis was over! The abduction attempt would be immediately informed to the police and the Bat's sources. Dent would not be snatched without sparking a fire fight or an all out alert! You can't just have him walked in to a car be driven off and not be notice of his disappearance until it was too late. It is simply illogical for both simply vanished like that. The two aren't homeless on the streets! We can forgive the use of Joker power at the sequence where Lt Gordon was shot, but what happen next was unforgiving. Unless there are super natural forces at work, no one in the real world would set an entire hospital with the amount of demolition charges seen in the sequence while the place was fully operational all the time before that. We watch and enjoy the gang in Oceans 13 went to great length and effort to simulate an earth quake under the target hotel, and set in place all their tricks before the hotel was fully operational. If that wasn't enough proof of superior Joker power, he loaded two boat prepared and guarded by the army with stationed big barrel bombs, not in a pick-up truck loaded with bombs like the one seen in the science fiction movie dejavu. There is no argument that sequence was great in execution but it would never have happen the way it was shown in a realistic world that follows real logic! Then, I wonder how many men Joker has under his disposal to help him round up so many hostages in the building. Logic tells us the bigger the operation the more attention it would draw, it would be impossible for the law enforcement not to aware all those are hostages instead of Joker's gang.Where is the realism? Well, Joker already explained to us: he does not play by rules! So this movie has no rules on the plot! For me, the second half of the movies is nothing but a few great set pieces sew together by illogical lines. These illogical plot elements totally destroy the movie's credibility and realism.I am not picking bones out of an egg. I simply apply common sense on the plot; therefore I will stop short of praising this film as a great logical 'normal' movie. It is a great Batman / comic movie never less, a great piece of entertainment if the audiences are willing to over look all those flaws.",0

What's all the hype about this movie? Serves well for comic fanboys but what about a layman? A mediocre thriller is way better than this CGI garbage!,0
"Wow... Words cannot even describe how incredibly awful this movie was.  The acting was poor, mediocre at best, (yes, that is including Heath  Ledger's supposedly ""oscar-worthy"" performance as the Joker) the plot  was simply terrible and amazingly uneven, as if no one had bothered to  make a final edit. It is one of the slowest and most boring movies I  have ever seen, I have never walked out of a movie before but I was  highly tempted with this mess, checking my watch every few minutes  before the one hour mark in what ended up being a two and a half hour  movie that seemed oh so much longer. I found that the best part of the  film was when the credits started rolling. Whilst Michael Bay's  blockbuster movies are terrible, at least they are somewhat  entertaining. Sadly, I cannot say the same for ""The Dark Knight.""  Ignore all the hype and don't be fooled by the trailers which suggest  this may be a good film - This movie was plain terrible, a complete  train wreck. 1/10",0

"Heath Ledger's joker is stupid and the most overhyped actor and movie in history by miserable kids. . Open beginning scene in broad daylight in Gotham with worst clown make up ripped off Brandon Lee's The Crow along with holding a mask waiting to get picked up by bank robbers.... passersby don't pay no attention at a weird damn clown like really!?! Tim Burton's Gotham is like the comic books.. it's gloomy, dark, full of gargoyle statues .. but in the dark knight it's always Sunny. Also the pencil trick is the most dumbest scene ever, no blood from the eye and Heath who is no Mr Muscle wrestled an angry black guy and for the pencil to stick on Blu Tak or bubblegum for it to stick upright and go all the way to the eye socket is pathetic. Even Hedge Leather can be pinned by the mobsters with guns to shoot him..the end, but they didn't kill him. Also what kind of Joker is he to not get excited by blowing things up and not have fun?...Boring! Also get away in a slow assed pace in a nurse uniform on a bus where cops could seal the area!?!
Heath Ledger's character is like an emo teen that is too high on weed without a plan, Jack Nicholson's Joker had a plan, the Penguin had a plan, Jim Carrey's Riddler had a plan, but Heath's joker doesn't have a plan, he is all over the place like diarrhea. The scene where Joker burnt the money is ripped off from quote by Donnie Darko to his Teacher Drew Barrymore, and this so-called edgy emo HL's Joker that is burning money is not a landslide when zillions of other paper money is all over the country, plus he brought a tailored purple suit with mobster cash, and he doesn't care about Money? LOL sure! Whatever. Jack Nicholson still rules, his face looks like a comic book character even without the make up.
The world's most overhyped movie ever.",0
"Well if you think this movie was better than ""Se7en, Fight club, Matrix,Psycho, etc. then you must have cinema.This movie is a good action movie but has literally nothint in it worth paying attention. The clown is none spookier than a spider your little sister (thats right pssy) already squashed and most of the characters don't know what they talk about. Joker wants to create havoc using paranoiac scyzophrenics, which would be the equivalent of trying to chop a sequoia with a rotten salmon, since paranoiac schyzophrencs don't know the difference between reality, guns, banks, etc. Two-face is just useless and the movie has no message whatsoever. Even the joker doesn't know the difference between chaos and anarchy. I could go on and on about the stupidity manifested in this film, but if you don't care about your own why would you not vote an unworthy film to be the 6th best film (wont know where it will be when you read it, but hope that it descends to at least 500th place) like this. shame on you. but if you hate cinema, you just have to follown the work of adam sandler.

"Just earlier this week i sat down and watched the 1966 classic movie, ""Batman"". After watching this movie, i felt happy, amused and satisfied, i knew i had spent 100 minutes of my life watching a movie i seriously enjoyed. Great over-acting, fantastic fight scenes and a truly epic storyline kept me watching this the whole way through and waiting to see what happened next. So you may be asking you're PC screen why I'm telling you about a movie which you weren't hoping to read a review for, well I'll tell you. The original 1966 Batman combined tongue in cheek humour, vast amounts of our favourite villains, and most importantly, Batman, yes, the very character you'd expect to see in a Batman Movie, however, in ""The Dark Knight"" we don't get Batman, we get a Dark Knight. And that is were the problems in The Dark Knight originate, often the movie can't decide whether or not it wants to be a Batman movie or a serious feature about an angry and revenge-driven man who protects the people who need protection the most, because you can't make a movie about both, because the bottom line is that the original Batman was about a regular man that dressed up as a bat and fought ridiculous villains, but now it seems as if the more recent Batman films wish to dust their origins under the rug and create this new, dark and twisted character. Obviously, the movie has a much more adult twist, compare any of it to ""Batman and Robin"" and the differences are vast, but is that really a bad or good thing? Certainly being similar to Batman And Robin would be disheartening for any movie director, but the point I'm trying to make is that perhaps the Dark Knight has come too far away form that silly slapstick version of Batman we all grew up with. And that may just be the problem, the movie spends to much time focusing on the dark creepy side of Batman's problems and doesn't focus on what we all go to a Batman movie to see, a hero fighting a villain, regardless of how wacky it is. However, this movie does have one truly great saving factor in Heath Ledger's wonderful and convincing performance as the Joker, although i still find his degree of insanity to little, the script making him too dark and sadistic, instead of crazy and manic, meaning Jack Nicholson's first performance is still my favourite, even above Ceaser Romero from the 1966 film and series; not saying that Heath Ledger acted this role incorrectly, he performed the Joker exactly how the writers wanted him to, but i'm not sure if that was the right decision. This movie puts the whole superhero problem into perspective, but it gives the Dark Superhero side a machine gun, and the wacky Superhero side an inflatable hammer, because in today's world there are few that want to see the true roots of Batman, they just want to be blown away with special effects ,difficult to view fight scenes and sinister gore, and The Dark Knight certainly provides plenty of these things, and none of the original humour. The thing is, today director's either make a movie dark and graphic and take the risk of scaring or putting off the viewers who came for a good fight, or they go back to origins and have their hero's fighting villains and saving the world, and in Batman 1966 and The Dark Knight, either side of the problem is represented. It just seems as if Batman cant quite strike the right chord and it may continue to have that problem unless a Director with an open mind and fresh ideas steps in and takes control of whichever future movies Batman stars in. This wonder director would need to find a way of pleasing both fans, but as far as I'm aware, that will be nearly impossible. Most of the shots and scenes in the movie are fine, but the Director still chooses to give you that awkward dizzy feeling by putting you right in the action and zooming around with the characters, instead of the Spielberg effect of watching the movie as if it's happening right there with you, and that's another problem, you just don't believe this batman, granted he's more realistic that the original Adam West patented Batman, but they've just gone too far, becoming nearly invincible and too cold towards everyone else. Furthermore, Christian Bale's second performance as Batman is just as weak and flat as his original, he still displays a clear lack of humour or emotion, and you just don't believe him, it always feels as if someone is holding up a cue card for him to read just off screen, and two movies in he still hasn't really nailed the role, i don't know anyone who impersonates Batman in Christian Bale's style, and i probably never will. So, to leave you with some closing comments, i think you should all see The Dark Knight just to judge for yourself, if you're into moody, dark and graphic realism then this will be a great treat for you, and you may come on here and argue your point against me, but if you're hoping for a great Superhero flick, with thrilling fights and a storyline that keeps you holding on the the end , i found myself counting the minutes until the credits began to roll, then you may just be a little more than disappointed with Batman's darkest and moodiest outing to date.",0
"I went to see this movie thinking it should be real good, number 1 9.5 score in IMDb top 250 and 158$ mil in the first weekend.Wrong, the movie stinks, weak plot, characters have no depth, editing is really bad, it's hard to follow what's going on, action scenes are bad, it uses this cheap sound sound to try and make you tense in certain scenes, the movie overall is completely not enjoyable.This movie is a case of the king is naked, it is so hyped many people just fool themselves into thinking this is a good movie, it's not, if you compare it to real good movies you will see how much this stinks.Bottom line is, this movie gets more hate from me than it deserves because it's hyped to be something it is not.",0
"didn't like it. no spoilers here, I won't ruin it for you, you might like it, I nearly walked out, but didn't out of respect for the late Heath Ledger (who apparently did one more film after this which I heard really stank), and also in hopes it would pick up towards the end. personally I was disappointed, particularly in the end, where one character, decided to take the heat for something which I thought was a pointless and unnecessary plot device.I thought all the actors did a fine job, since when is Gotham in Illinois? in the DC Comics it's a stand-in for NYC,like Metropolis, but has been established as a separate city, in NY or NJ now I think. that area anyway. I was not freaked out watching Ledger, was not thinking about the fact that he was now dead as I watched his performance. I know it was Ledger's swan-song, but come on, it's not that great. Bat's voice was a little too cookie-monster/death-metal, Keaton found the right level of gritty for it. I liked him better.it was too long, too dark and intense, and had too many holes, which I won't mention so as not to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. I'm losing faith in the film industry. if I'm going to spend upwards of $9 for a film, I want spaceships, or dragons, anything else I can wait for video on frankly, if it isn't a spectacle, I can wait. but genre films have been letting me down lately. still plan on seeing Iron Man, but actually, now I'm starting to feel like I can wait on that one, even though I suspect I will enjoy it more than I did the last three films I saw in the theatre. (Hancock :| the Hulk :\ ) oh wait I saw Hellboy, that was much more fun. very enjoyable.I liked the last bat-film, so I had high hopes for this one. I started to wonder what was wrong about 3/4 of the way through, I felt the urge to leave, I haven't had that happen to me in some time. action sequences, yes very impressive, it's all been done, I'm not that easily impressed by your flawless special effects anymore, if they don't serve a story, it's just eye candy, I guess I'm getting tired of lowering my expectations of genre films all the way. I don't understand why so many people are ga-ga for this film. It took me 50 pages of clicking to find a non favourable review, and once I found them, I found more reasons why I didn't like it, which I hadn't had time to think about, but I plan on not thinking about this movie any more. the next Bat film, I will wait for video on if there is a next one.I didn't like the Joker's make up like much of the film, it was all too realistic, comic book superhero movies have become afraid of being too ""comic-booky"" to their detriment. I'm not advocating yellow spandex for Wolverine, but I remember when the Batmobile looked like a cross between a Corvette Stingray and a Caddy, now it looks like a Hummer/tank. apt analogy, this movie is like an SUV, too big and consuming, frankly depressing by the end.",0
"The amount of violence in this film is disturbing for anyone, let alone PG-13. I expected comic book violence in the film, but I was appalled at the mass destruction and menace that smacks of terrorism. Is this what the creator of Batman intended? Moreover, while the plot of choosing good over evil is admirable, I feel that the sub-plot of masking good as evil for the sake of the order, is manipulative and dishonest. Sure it's a good ploy for setting up future Batman films, but it's merely setting the stage for more of the same old stuff. How much violence and bad heroes do we really need to be entertained?",0
"After seeing this movie...I thought of a more appropriate title...instead of ""Dark Knight"", I would have called it...""The Butchers of Gotham City"" ...to honor of the director, writers and actors... of course...This movie is a waste of time...a whole lot of time...at least on a DVD you can fast forward and protect what little is left of your brain.Question...aren't movies supposed to make at least some small attempt to resemble an ""art form""...??? The director of this movie apparently doesn't think so... or much of the concept that ""less is more""...nope...not Nolan.Sometimes by trying to do too much you can end up with nothing...like trying to jump a crevasse that is 5 feet too wide...You know you have problems when you start to cringe inside when it's imminent that a particular character will re-appear on screen... and you realize that you will have to sit through another minute of a one-dimensional performance that you have already seen a few hundred times already...Yep...I'm talking about Keith Ledger's joker...his career really ended up there on Brokeback Mountain...or should have.Where was Jack Nicholson when we really needed him? And what happened to the plot... where was that darned infernal plot?...I guess if you hide the plot you keep people from leaving the theater in droves, because they will wait for it all to make sense in the end...but that never happened.Well...maybe I am indeed being too harsh...after all, this movie was apparently written during the writer's strike...they should have just paid them what they wanted...Maybe different editing would have saved this one...some attempt at editing might have helped, it certainly couldn't have hurt ...they really should have spent a few more $$$ and edited the thing, but they needed to go back and take a class in Plot 101 first.On a scale of 1-10, I give it a 2...and my generosity is only for the ""...watch me make a pencil disappear..."" line...Do yourselves a favor...catch that scene on you tube...it's the only scene in the film worth watching.TC",0
"I've given the film a rating of 1 for two reasons: Film is of poor quality. Film is overrated to the point that I can no longer conjure images of it without immediate hate. This film is my 9/11. Why I didn't enjoy the film? Batman's voice resembled a cigarette smoked by Joe Cocker. Plot holes. Dialog written by a 15 year old who read a wiki article on philosophy but wants everyone to speak in Matrix vernacular. Poor choreography.In a film that had the presence of Michael Jai White, the fight sequences somehow felt like an episode of Kung Fu. On the bright side, we got to discover Batman's weakness through a un-Lucky surprise attack from....killer robots? No. Aliens? No. Superman? No. Dogs? Yes, Batman was incapacitated by two dogs. Not even Cerberus dogs, who would have 1.5 heads per limb on Batman. ""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villain."" Because, uh, um, it's convenient to say the plot. Seriously, I've only had this statement come up in casual conversation when talking to interns. Boring, pretentious, clumsy movie with a soundtrack that sounds like beached whales emulating a dying keyboardist.",0
"like many other posts here, i was so looking forward to this having thought that batman begins was after the first two superman films the best comic adaptation so far. what a let down, i agree with all the folk that said the film has no plot is repetitous and without any depth. of course the critics are all going to be sheep again it has already started, wow how dark this is, this word has been so overused to describe anything thats not light and fluffy and has now lost its meaning. this film just does not engage in any emotional way whatsoever. in going for realism nolan has lost any sense of wonder and fantasy that the previous film had. that had proper comic book villains well portrayed, the joker here is one dimensional had a problem dad and now just wants to destroy batman and everything else. i think we have had quite enough of this villain, lets put him to rest. this was going to be my film of the year, but like so many others my anticipation was blown away by mediocrity, mr. nolan please take note of the negative criticisms here, these are written by true fans of you and your films so far you have delivered with your previous films but now seem to have gone astray. get your scripts tighter, the film was at least a half hour to long, and really had nothing to say or to entertain.",0
"My personal opinion is that this is one of the worst superhero movies of all time, as I can sadly say about the whole trilogy.Sadly, because it had such potential.. and robbed the story of Batman from its heart.""Why so serious?""
Yes, why so serious!?
Nothing to ease the anxious feeling you got from watching sad dialogues and action filled fights..The movie lacked heart completely and will always be remembered as a complete waste of time.",0
"I do respect the score of the movie since more than 2m people rated..But, I think this movies has nothing special in terms of story, in terms of screenplay, in terms of cinematography; and doesnt deserve such a high place in the list.",0
Its just a masterpiece. cause it is the definition of storytelling and other directors should look up to this,0
"All these batman stuff has been done before, there is nothing special about this movie. Batman Begins is better.The portrayal of Joker is inaccurate, it doesn't even look like him.

"It pains me to see this shoot to the top of the best ever films. Yes, I'm well aware that as time goes on this film will find a more deserving place in these tables... but averaging 9.4, even now? This is by no means a bad film. It was mediocre and far, far too long. A neat ending point could have occurred around 1.5 hours in and I, and most of the theatre from what I heard afterwards, were a little bemused as to how the sparse plot managed to be dragged on for so long. Had this film been appropriately cut, I believe I would have actively enjoyed it.Heath Ledger(RIP) was by far the shining star in this film. His performance as The Joker is spot on: deeply sinister and almost nauseating at times, yet very funny at the right moments. Caine and Oldman are, as always, perfectly engaging. Bale, as much as I admire his other performances, really didn't seem up to scratch in this film as the caped crusader: he seemed far too much of a caricature. As Wayne, he was better.When it comes down to it, performances aside, this is an action film with minimal plot and little else to speak of that drags on almost endlessly. See it if you're bored- otherwise I wouldn't bother. Certainly don't expect a comparable follow up to 'Batman Begins'.",0
"I am a hardcore movie buff. I've seen them all and studied them all. Of all the movies said to be the greatest of all time or a contender of one of the greatest of recent times, this is the most undeserving. Do I really think that this is a 1/10? No. I ranked it this low hoping 9.0 rating would eventually drop. Because 9/10 on this site in 4th place? Many other sites ranked this either at the top or near the top? What the hell?! I will say that this was well made. The cinematography, action and danger sequences were well-done. But not as good as, say, Die Hard. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker is what carries the movie and is the only reason why it is ranked so high. Without Heath Ledger as The Joker, the movie would have been as dull as The Dark Knight Rises. Ledger gives one of the best performances in recent memory, but people treat it like it's better than De Niro in Raging Bull or Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. Because of him, they also treat it like it's up to par with the likes of Schindler's List and Shawshank Redemption. I gather those people have never seen either one, because both those movies blow The Dark Knight out of the water.What it my problem with this? It's concept is stupid. Citizens of Gotham blame all crime on Batman, and Bruce Wayne agrees. He thinks Gotham's true hero is DA, Harvey Dent. Dent may be Wayne's buddy, he even he knows it's bogus. As The Joker rises and spreads chaos, Batman is still treated like a villain and Bruce just takes it. What a dumb-ass! And that's what goes on throughout the whole movie! ""You are responsible for all crime Batman!"" ""Open your eyes! Can't you see it's The Joker that doing all this? You're welcome for me protecting you! Next time I'll just let The Joker kill you guys and let Harvey Dent save you."" I can see why they would label Harvey Dent as a hero, but can he really save people from a burning building? Or falling off a cliff? No, that's what Batman is for. Batman may not be allowed to kill, but just break his arms and legs: problem solved. And the Joker roams freely out in the open. With patriots and a half- decent police force, snipers would have capped him in an instant. The movie is very slow (practically getting nowhere) and the character development isn't very strong. The characters are developed into stunned pushovers. Good action, The Joker, and Two-Face were the only reasons this movie was worth watching. Joker and Two-Face/Harvey Dent where the only good characters in this.It baffles me how high people can rate and praise such a generic movie. The must not know how ratings work. Do they know who Robert De Niro is? Have they heard of Steven Spielberg? Have they seen Gone With The Wind? Maybe this movie isn't as bad as I said, but it is so overrated, I get sick of it easily and strongly believe it does not deserve the praise it gets.0/4",0
"I have enjoyed every outing of Batman till I watched 'The Dark Knight' and 'Batman Begins.' The basic story, from a comic book, is a comic story. As soon as it is put into a semblance of real life it fails. The main character is a man who dresses up as a bat. This is funny. The Dark Knight trilogy is made by people with no sense of humor. Who cares about lunatics that wear weird costumes and commit crimes? In the real world these pathetic folks would be locked up. The original Batman TV show and Tim Burton's outings maintain the humor inherent in the story. Subtract the humor and you have long dull scenes in between action sequences. Get rid of the long talky scenes and the Dark Knight films would be fair action films. If you are like me and prefer light and humor, these films are not for you. Even 'Breaking Bad' had some humor in it. I maintain that Batman is inherently humorous and thus the Dark Knight series fails to capture or honor the original.",0
"Immediately the title is off-putting, ""The Dark Knight"". Who in their right mind names a Batman Movie ""The Dark Knight"". You could write me an essay on how it is a brilliant title which is deep on so many levels but I won't have it. The inclusion of the word knight only makes me think of medieval times and the only thing medieval about this film is that it is a perfect form of medieval torture. Every time I am forced to watch this whether in class or at home because ""some"" deem it the best movie ever made a part of me wants to die.Here is a plot summary of the Dark Knight if you have been lucky enough not to have watched it. (Joker confronts mob saying he can kill Batman; mob think he is crazy. Joker broadcasts plan and says people will die until Batboy turns himself in, people think he's crazy. Harvey Dent wants to take down whole mob with one swoop, Mob thinks Dent is crazy.) That is only half of the plot and adds up for an hour and a half of boring predictable screen filler. So many subplots and characters overcrowd this movie. With the characters they have in this movie they could have made 4 great films but instead they made one cluster disaster. The other half of the movie isn't even worth mentioning it is so bad.The only good thing in the second half of the movie is where Rachael and Harvey are rigged to explosives at different locations and Batman has to pick one so he chooses Rachael. It turns out to be Harvey so Rachael dies! Yes! Thank you! I have never wanted a main character to die so much in my life. She is a useless character who just seems to dig her way into the story but adds nothing to it. Bruce considers her his love interest but she doesn't even like him so it is perfect that they killed her off. I applaud them for this. I applaud them because they completely disregarded logic in order to kill her. Surely there was enough time to save both if some police officers in the area did their job for once and went to the addresses. But no they did the right thing and it helps me sleep at night knowing Rachael is dead.The Joker is considered the start of the show but he is a really lazily developed character. He has no backstory and even the pathetic writers didn't give him a back story to work with. Heath Ledgers voice wasn't even used for filming because the Imax projectors were so loud so all sounds had to be added post production. Maybe this is why the joker doesn't feel scary or realistic. They ruined everything they had by dubbing Heath ledger. It makes me feel entirely detached from the whole movie not having original sounds.The Joker is a waste of space. He is not at all like what the Joker should have been in terms of his plans. Jokers usually generate chaos and disregard anything fair. But in this awful adaptation he acts more like Harvey Dent in the comics with his 50/50 scenarios, like the boat scene. The two villains are too much alike. They could have created this movie to have focused on just Harvey or the Joker but instead we end up with two undeveloped characters. How do you mess up this badly when they literally own the rights to some of the best comic book characters in history? It's like being given the instructions to a Lego kit and eating the Lego instead. How do you mess up this badly?The Jokers purpose in the movie is to push Batman to his limits in terms of morals. Batman has one rule; he will not kill. But what does he do at the end to Harvey Dent?!?! We are just meant to overlook this? He was willing to kill for one boy but won't kill the joker who threatens a whole city. If Batman got a Glock and killed anyone who threatened innocent people, this would have been a very short movie. If Batman was willing to kill for greater good which defies his whole moral code, then the whole character is useless.In conclusion this movie is an awful comic book adaptation which is about as funny as Schindler's list. This movie will make you send a complaint to piratebay.com for allowing you to illegally download this movie. Everyone involved with the making of this film should be publicly shamed for the rest of their natural lives. The people who made this film are the sort of scum that lie about having cancer so they can claim the benefits. I hope every night they wake up asking themselves why did I ever get involved with that garbage. This movie is still better than Batman Vs Superman Dawn of Justice. Will Batman ever get justice and have a good movie?",0
"This movie does not deliver on any level. What a boring, long, agonizing film this is. This movie will do well due to the unfortunate circumstance with Ledger and the DC Batman following. But to be honest this movie is dull and falls very short of the hopes I had for it. Sorry fans but I call them like I see them. The dialog was terrible and scene after scene it seemed that the film makers just repeated the same things over and over again. Was there ever any suspense? Were you ever really worried about the outcome? No to both. The movie was well made to be fair. Visually it held up. Ledger did a fine job with his role. Had he not died would we really be building this into what it has become? No again. Save your money and wait for HBO to see this.",0
"This movie is ranked as the 4th best on IMDb that pisses me off because so many people think IMDb top 250 is the definitive list, it is not in fact it is not much different from all the other voting lists done by the public and people who put this in there top 10 you will find have not seen many of the classics or don't like them cos they are stupid or just in there teens or both like I am but I know movies now just know this is not a top 10 if anything it is at the bottom off a top 100 list, Im not saying this cant be in your top 10 favorite movies it can, it can be number 1 if you want but don't say it is one of the top 10 best movies ever, because it is not, the same with a lot of other top 250 films, Shawshank is NOT the best film off all time, I will give you my list of my 10 favorite films off all time 1. The Godfather 2. Pulp Fiction 3. Raging Bull 4. Apocalypse Now 5. The Good The Bad and The Ugly 6. A clockwork orange 7 . 2001 8 Life Of Brian 9. Taxi Driver 10. One Flew over the cuckoo's nest. only 2 maybe 3 of them are top 10 material and those are The Godfather, Raging Bull and maybe 2001 but I can admit that those others are not as high as I would place them all you Dark Knight fan boys should start, like a lot of the other overrated movies on the list it is still great but it doesn't deserve to be so high for better lists of best movies off all time look at AFI 100 years 100 movies and sight & sounds poll",0
"While the central performance from Heath Ledger is a superb portrayal of madness the muddled plot and centre sound channel for the vocals makes this piece of storytelling very difficult to follow. In fact, I had to watch the Blu-ray of this film in three sittings because I got so frustrated with it until the last 30 minutes or so when it did actually introduce a fairly original idea (the two ships primed to explode). There are too many poorly developed characters in this film which meant I didn't really care about any of them. I seem to remember that the first film in this relaunched series ('Batman Begins') was also muddled but at least that was was a bit more comprehensible than this follow-up due to the first segment explaining Batman's origin. A couple of points - why does Batman talk in that ridiculous husky voice while as Bruce Wayne he does not? Presumably, so that he is not recognised as his alter-ego but I just found it laughable. Why does the aspect ratio change from standard widescreen to the IMAX format for the action sequences? This is either an unnecessary gimmick - (films should be kept in one aspect ratio or the other) or they couldn't afford to shoot the whole film in IMAX.",0
"The Dark Knight has been grotesquely over-praised. It is a passably competent superhero movie, albeit one with few virtues and a great many flaws. It certainly is not one of the greatest films of all time - it shouldn't even be in the top fifty.The virtues first. Heath Ledger's performance is quite good. Not brilliant - quite good. He has little to work with, but he does do his best with it. Although his Joker is more a mass of tics and mannerisms than anything deeper, they are memorable - and he brings a bit of gusto and a sense of a personality.The other actors, all of them very good in other films, have even less to do than Heath - they work bravely to round out dull, simplistic lines and resoundingly empty characters. Nobody here, except Commissioner Gordon, has any suggestion of a home life. Nobody has any personality. These people are plot functions, pawns in moving things from A to B. Of the good guys, Maggie Gyllenhaal perhaps goes the furthest in investing her character with some spark.The flaws? Numerous. For a start, the film shows bad editing and direction for the fight and chase sequences. Half the time, it isn't clear who is near to who or what they are in danger from. Meanwhile, the overall visual style is bland and unimaginative and suspense is generally minimal because every twist is thuddingly obvious.The dialogue is functional but clumsy - for example, we are told twice, just in case we didn't get it, that Harvey Dent may be prepared to take on the criminals of Gotham but he feels scared at a fund-raising dinner. Nobody, in the entire movie, not once, reacts like a real human being, to anything that happens - everything is stagey, simplistic, artificial.And the philosophy? The depth that is supposed to make this ""more than a comic book movie""? Not there. For a start, it is impossible to take seriously pronouncements on the human condition from a movie whose view of crime is that criminals are all either members of a Dick Tracy style mob underworld who sit around in suits, embodying racial and cultural stereotypes and talking about how the Batman is cutting in on their action, on the one hand, or pure, unexplainable EEEEEVIL freaks on the other. As a representation of evil, sin, temptation, crime or madness, this is so pathetically empty and stupid and clichéd it would be unimpressive in a children's cartoon. To anyone who has seen The Wire, read the news or even just been outside and talked to actual adults, it seems laughable. It's hard to take a movie seriously at all when its sense of crime comes down to something so callow and so naive.But apart from that, the movie does not seem to have the courage of its convictions. It flirts with an authoritarian message about needing a superman to protect us from chaos, someone who has to be empowered with the right to pry into our privacy and lie to us - a daddy who always knows best. And it toys with the idea that humans are fundamentally bad - but then decides that, no, people aren't after all (when neither group on the ships chooses to blow the other up). Except when they are (as Harvey Dent turns to the dark side). This is not searing complexity. This is trying not to offend anyone whilst flirting with relevance to contemporary political debates. This is saying nothing, very loudly and a bit pompously.",0
"What an anti-climax! There we go, I said right it off the bat. If Nolan wanted a character driven movie... he failed. Maggie Gyllenhall was like a wooden version of Katy Holmes, which I thought wasn't possible. Also playing a two timing hussy wasn't exactly an endearing quality. I'm tired of listening to Bale over-act Batman, someone fix his speech impediment please so he doesn't look & sound like he's trying to lay a Guiness World Record pineapple. How anyone can get an Oscar is beyond me, Ledger doesn't actually get enough screen time in my view & making slurping noises with your mouth doesn't sell crazy. Heath said that he wanted audiences to forget Jack Nicholson as the Joker but I was often thrust down memory lane, all the way back to the original Batman. Nicholson had been playing crazy long before Batman, One Flew Over the Cockoo's Nest, The Shining etc, so Ledger really had a tough task... in which he did OK but not Oscar nommie stuff. Also, what happened to the dark 'gothic' Gotham City Burton created? You can't have CGI Two Face in a normal looking US city, I wanted the full dark comic style of old! It felt like the movie dragged a little & had some weird head shaking anomalies, eg: When Batman drops Mafia Boss, seemingly breaking his ankles but later he seems fine with his ornamental walking stick. I couldn't help laughing at Batman's motorbike & the great wall stunt. Not at all what I had hoped for in this semi-entertaining film... the Box Office is happy tapping into the female ticket sale as they finally go & see a Batman movie for their lost heart throb Heath but I heard snoredom from the rows of girls behind me. Bring Burton back to Batman!!!",0
"One of the worst movies I ever seen. I didn't see it when it came out. I saw it on my 50 inch flat screen, hooked up to my stereo.All my friends were telling me how good this movie was so I expected a lot.Heath Leger was good cause everybody else was so bad. This was one of the most boring Batman ever. He spoke in that deep voice with no personally.All the scenes were dark. It would have been nice if a little bit more of the movie was bright.My main problem watching this was the sound. When they spoke, I had to turn to volume way up. Then when the special effects took place, I had to lower it. Then I had to turn it up again when they spoke.",0
"Heath Ledger played a brilliant Joker, and Christian Bale was a good Batman. Batman is supposed to be for little kids. It should not be dark and scary. This was by far the worst Batman Movie. I would still hope that they will continue the adventure. It just completely veered away from how Batman should be. The actors were good. The plot was horrible. Harvey Dent is not a good guy. I don't care how many criminals he put away. Batman put away many more. You cant let a horrible and psychologically unstable man be remembered as a good guy. The Joker was EXCELLENT. It was Heath's best role ever. I am just sad to see him go. This is just my opinion of the movie. I encourage everyone to see it and create their own opinions.",0
"A bad guy while fighting batman says 'impressive, most impressive' and then does a swirly cloak thing, did no-one else notice? Why is he quoting Darth? This movie was more disappointing than the second Tim Burton batman movie and a waste of talent. Batman is now little better if not worse than the bad guys, he needs therapy, he's a rich, narcissistic, deluded boy with way too much power. Off to Arkham with you bats in a straitjacket. I used to love Batman but this is rubbish. And since when does a review have to be more than ten lines long? Or not allowed slang words, so annoying. At least Adam West was fun as Batman, OK Keaton was short but I found him believable and then after him there was awfulness. Christian Bale's gravelly voice thing is annoying, nevermind the reasoning behind it. Never thought I'd say it but Ironman maybe the better super hero, at least he's honest about his flaws.",0
"To make it short, the movie is not that bad, its a 6/10 movie for me, but the overrated ratings, some maybe even paid, are ridiculous. This movie belongs not in the Top Ten or even in the Top Hundred Movies of all Time. I hope this gets fixed over time, and hope other movie fans are rating it the same way I do.Can't say anymore, won't bore you, but have to get the lines full, so I would like to to push some other movies for you to watch, some real Top Ten or Top Hundred movies, some classics like:The Apartment, Alien, Terminator, Blade Runner, Brazil, 1957, Fight Club, City of God, Seven, The Intouchablesetc. etc. Go watch these movies, and then tell me in all seriousness, that The Dark Knight is better...",0
"I've seen this movie more than twice but I felt like I needed to in order to prove that I wasn't just in a horrible mood the second time I watched it. So I did see it a 3rd and even a 4th. Same opinion, but more solidified.Let me back up. I saw this movie, opening night, out at the IMAX near Dulles Airport, and I was absolutely BLOWN away. The effects! Heath Ledger's psychotic Joker! The IMAX! WOW!! I walked out saying ""that was freaking awesome!! I can't wait to come back and finish it!!"" Yes, you read correctly. Finish it. This girl I took, decided to tell me in line that she doesn't like ""Dark"" movies and asked if it was ""Dark"". She walked out mortified 30 min into the movie.I went back, same theater, a couple days later, as about as excited (even more so now) as a movie fan could ever be, and I watched intently. The longer the movie went on, the more frustrated I became. I didn't want to be disappointed but how could I?? It is just simply a bad movie! This is one of the greatest examples of Hollywood putting a TON of money into a film (Actors, Special Effects, Marketing, etc.), without ever making sure the whole thing made sense! How does a director as experienced as Nolan, not shake his head and go ""wait guys, hold up, we can't have Batman jump out of a 4 story window and land on the concrete without opening his cape or firing off one of his 'wonderful little toys', or something. I mean c'mon do we think these movie go'ers are dumb?!"". I dunno Chris do you? Few things that really got to me. Firstly, Maggie Gyllenhaal, is a great actress, and this is no shot at her or her ability, but she was horrifically casted in this movie. I feel like her current up and coming status in Hollywood is what landed her this role, not if she was the right fit for the part. And by the way, where is Katie Holmes? Did you think we weren't going to notice? I mean, this isn't a minor, couple line role here. Nor do Maggie and Katie look at all alike really. I mean this is about as noticeable as Ashton Kutcher replacing Charlie Sheen on 2 1/2 Men! No attempt at saying it's her sister, or cousin, or maybe just write her out of the script? ""Oh, so sad Master Bruce what happened to young Rachel Dawes in that trip to Breckenridge last spring. Just awful. I'm so sorry."" BOOM. Done. No mystery. Let's move on with the story! It was hard to look beyond really, and just shows what lack of thought went into the whole movie in my opinion. Either negotiate KH's contract or don't include her character. No thought is for the viewer, just ""Ohhhhh theyy won't even notice"". BAD.Secondly, Heath Ledger. The man did an awesome job and deserved that Oscar, here or hereafter. He brought an element to that role that didn't exist with Jack, and Jack was phenomenal. He made the character sadistic almost. Like grown men were afraid of him like Javier Bardom in No Country For Old Men. Just a frightening S.O.B. Jack was a bad dude and you knew he was bad but he was also a little humorous, and you kinda liked him. You didn't like Heath's Joker. You were mesmerized but couldn't love him. He did this all while having a bad script, no character development, and, what seemed like, 45 min in the middle of the movie where he's MIA. Also, he's got the most ""makes no sense what so ever"" scenes, where he's doing things that if you stopped for 2 seconds to be like ""where'd he get that?!"" or ""how'd he do that?!"" or ""wait, where'd he come from?!"", your frustration factor would have been increased ten fold. But, you didn't, and why? Because he performed above it, and as much to his credit for that, is to the discredit of the makers, for short siding him on an amazing final performance. Imagine how much better it could have been if he actually had something to work with! Lastly, yet.......I saved this one for last because it is by far the most irritating aspect of any movie I've maybe ever seen.....Christian Bale's voice when dressed as Batman. He clearly liked it so much that he carried it over into Terminator Salvation (which was appalling too). But what in the heck? He was taking multiple breaths in the same sentence because of how much effort he was putting into that low growl of a voice/accent/whatever. ""I........ONNNNLLLYYYY HAVVVEEE.........ONNNNEEE RUUULLLLEEE"". So dumb. Which is why his line's were all 3 words long.Overall, extremely disappointing and I point out my two experiences for a reason. All that was wanted from the movie go'er here was to be mesmerized by the costumes, effects, and their excitement for its release (relentless marketing), would blind them from the slop job they paid to see. And what's so frustrating is that the slop job was done before anyone ever showed up on set, before ""Action"" was ever yelled, before one growl of Bale's voice was ever moaned. It was lost in the planning, the writing, the brainstorming, the overall thought process behind a story. There was none, and thank god for Heath Ledger because without him, this movie wouldn't have been so blinding.Not excited for the next one. Gotta say. But Nolan did do Inception, which is one of the best movies of all time, so maybe I'll give him another shot.",0
"I actually enjoyed this movie, it was a little too long and it doesn't give anything new, it has just the same as any average action movie: a hero, a very bad man, innocent lives in danger... But it didn't turn out bad, the result is a pretty good action movie. Something's just wrong here though, the Joker was horribly characterized, I mean what they did with the Joker is actually cool, it gives him a very chaotic image, but I can't say it's the Joker, that bad bad BAD man from the Batman comics and from the TV series, I remember him as an always clean and always refined guy, with his perfectly applied makeup just like a real psycho would, in contrast with this movie, where we see him like some kind of chaotic crazy hobo, it bothered me so much. Anyway don't get mad for the rating I gave this movie, I won't give it more stars because this is already #4 in IMDb's Top Movies on History and that's just wrong for this completely average movie.",0
"Yes, grow up! Having been informed by many a review that this was 'an adult superhero/fantasy movie'...I thought I would finally check it out.The score, currently 9.0 on here also attracted me to it. I must say that I find the genre not for me, but I did enjoy 'V for Vendetta.' I was informed that if I liked that, I would love this.Nonsense! This movie is for kids...apart from some political stuff (to make it feel all grown up). The word 'Batman' is the clue.There are a few annoying scenes where our hero is unarmed and facing umpteen bad guys with machine guns. Not one manages to get off a shot. Batman just beats them all up. Ridiculous! Grown up, you say? Batman's voice sounded like a bad impersonation of Clint Eastwood. Hilarious! The movie wasn't the worst I've seen but it was no better than any Jerry Bruckhiemer movie.All I saw was BOOMBANGABANGBANG!The Christopher Nolan love in continues.Fans of his and this genre are ruining IMDb. He's made a couple of average films and that's it.9/10? If you are over the age of 12 and still think so, all I can say is...Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! GROW UP!",0
"Some of the effects were good and some of the acting (The Joker in drag was great), but god was it long and at times just boring to watch. If you ignore all the hype and just watch it as a film you could have either had 3 films or condensed this into a couple of hours rather than nearly 3! The editing on the DVD was crap too it seemed at times that bits of the film were missing, especially when the Joker is confronting the guy by the pool table. The scene ends rather suddenly and if he had cut the guy as we are lead to believe why no screams? 2 face was a little flat as a character too in my opinion. No a top 10 film of all time by a long shot.",0
"Just for the record I'm not the biggest batman fan, even though I liked the tim burton version and watched the cartoon shows doesn't mean squat. I hated that awful batman beyond, the other batman sequels. So I'm 50/50 on batman. To me when I saw batman begins I was only anticipating a bad movie considering the fact that I did not enjoy any of Joel Schulmacher versions. When I finally saw batman begins I couldn't help but vomit. Why was this s**t a hit? I went to go see the sequel only cause I was on a date and she loved the Joker character, so thats how I ended up seeing the Dark knight film.When I watched the dark knight I was still expecting a bad flick with that awful music score and the cheesy deadpan acting with its dialogue that can put an 8 year old to sleep. Well I knew it wasn't that great from the get go.I'm aware of Heath ledgers tragic death. But a movie is still a movie and I hate the fact that they are overhyping it cause of his death and that makes me sick.The movie was downright disappointing to me. I apologize to all the comic book aficionados but I wasn't impressed.1. The plot of the movie seems kind of out there: Manipulating a campaign to cause havoc? Like people give a crap about politics.2. The Joker is overrated. Heath ledger didn't give a bad performance but the character of the joker is a far departure from all the other jokers. To me all I saw was ""the Crow"" with green hair. Whats with that thing he does with his tongue? As for his scars, they just remind me of the character ""Kakihara"" from ichi the killer. So I didn't get any kind of entertainment from the joker.3. Batmans voice: Come on!! Thats the most laughable voice I ever heard on batman!! It sounds like he should be in a death metal band. I couldn't help but cringe. It sounded like fingers scratching against the chalk board.4. Its boring music score. Your gonna tell me that it overshadows Danny elfman batman score? It was used in the damn cartoon!! The Danny elfman score is a work of music art. I don't even remember how the music went in this new batman film.I can go on even further into why I didn't like this batman film but it'll be longer so I'll just end it in the ups I thought should be mentioned.Twoface: Aaron Eckhart gave a great performance in a great re-introduction of the villain. Wheres his Oscar nom? Gary oldman: The man rules as commissioner gordan.As far as I see it, even if it beats out titanic or new york city gets re-named Gotham city. I wouldn't buy this film on DVD or blu-ray even if the Joker has a gun to my head.PS: Jack Nicholson still kicks Heaths ass!!",0
"Im going to have to be brief because I hate this movie so much: 1. The Joker is too invincible. He is so invincible he can drive a bus out of a public place, rig a hospital and TWO boats and no one notices. Also everyone he comes in contact with even teenagers want to work for him even though he will kill them once needed. 2. Pointless characters. Lao should have been written out of the film, he adds nothing and amounts to nothing, pointless. The guy who knows who Batman is goes no where and his character only amounts to a stupid explosion 3. Breaks the main rule of cinema. The protagonist defeats the antagonists. There are two main villains in this movie and Batman doesn't defeat either one. 4. Harvey's motivation in the end. I hated Harvey through out the film but once he's two face he just becomes dumb, he believes that people should have a 50/50 chance like Rachel, though thats NOT WHAT HAPPENED. Gordan was just late so now he's going to and KILL GORDAN'S SON! There are other problems but those are the most major and I can not believe instead of noticing these problems people and went and gave it #8 on the top 250.",0
"The caliber of actors in this film was of the highest. Individual scenes were crafted to a fine artisan's level. The overall story meandered murkily and didn't pull together well. I was so disappointed. I reveled in the moments of scenes. And the ""Camp"" has started to slide in. Dent's character wasn't developed enough. The Joker needed more scenes for a total connection.(Ledger was damn good. Not just saying that to spare myself a bullet.) Not A lot of Batman development. A more gimmicky Batman than the one in Begins. Gordon was classic and Brilliant. Fox was good. Alfred classic. Rachel Dawes, strangely I think I would have enjoyed Holmes more in this movie and Gylenthal in the first.I almost feel like this movie could be re-cut to be a great film. Save parts that were weakly developed to be the seeds of a third movie rather than too quickly tied together here.I know I'm not stopping anyone from watching this film. I wouldn't dream of it. Maybe an ounce of warning is enough to spare pains and allow one to enjoy what is great about the film.",0
"I wonder, why, why people - in all over the world - like this? Appreciate all the psychopathic things?! This movie HASN'T GOT ANY MEANING useful for humanity. It includes only crime scene, maniac monologues, actions that are completely nonsense! It makes people more psychic, help them to reveal their maniac soul. It feeds people's sadism. How one can get pleasure of watching burnt face, people dying tragically? How can you enjoy the movie which is basically consist of noisy uninteresting, anti-human, completely cliché death scenes, dreadful faces, psycho monologues and nonsense! You watched it, so what? What did this movie give to you? What have you earned? People's psychology are weak, why we need to injure it more? Our world is already full of maniac people and this is the reason why this movie has got 9/10! Shame on people! Shame on the humanity!",0
"This movie moves faster and is far more entertaining than its predecessor, Batman Begins. But that doesn't say much. Batman Begins was thunderously dull, pretentious and oppressive: its central conceit, that the character of Batman can be made plausible if one spends hours and hours exploring every iota of emotional trauma and angst, and hours and hours more explaining where Batman gets his batsuit, batmobile and other gear, was ludicrous from the start.Conversely, the Dark Knight is not bogged down by any attempt to relate the characters and events to any known reality. Moon-size plot holes, too numerous to count, and cardboard characters populate this film.Batman is portrayed as a boy billionaire, scion of the super-rich, affecting a bored and callous exterior that allegedly conceals profound depths of emotion. He is dependent upon the aid and counsel of 2 old men, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, who run his home and personal life, his finances, and provide him with all the wondrous bat-gizmos.Batman is relentless, and while he allegedly is troubled by the fact that his pursuit of criminals is resulting in collateral damage amounting to the destruction of half the city, he does not let it stop him. He eventually becomes reviled by the citizens he is sworn to protect, but ultimately he keeps his 'resolve.' The Joker is referred to, multiple times, as a 'terrorist.' The Joker himself says he is a 'wild dog,' not motivated by greed or power, merely the joy of destruction. He cannot be rehabilitated, nor can he be appeased by the liberation of a people, nor can he be bought off.Ultimately Batman's pursuit of the Joker results in Batman literally tapping into every cell phone in Gotham City, and in the destruction of much of the supporting cast and a hospital full of patients. And Batman tortures people now. But of course Batman is ultimately successful, and this completes this bizarre fascist bedtime story.Writing this now, having had a shallow boy millionaire and 2 old men 'protecting' me for the past 8 years, having them tapping my phone and email, and having them blowing up 2 nations and killing a couple million people in the process, I was not pleased by the results. So pardon me, Chris Nolan, if I happen to think you are unimaginative and cowardly for using your bully pulpit to write a $200 million love letter to our now thankfully gone 'Leader.' A lot of creative people use their position to challenge the status quo, or to promote peace and tolerance, but apparently violence and sadism are more your cup of tea. Me, I've just finished 8 years in Gotham City and it was 8 years too many.",0
"I think the dudes who gives a good rate to this movie have an IQ under 75. Is the most ridiculous movie of the year. Bale is one of my favorites actors, but his character is so stupid , his voice when he wear the mask is ridiculous, his monologues are silly, that you almost not see him. The Joker character is the only think in this crap that is somehow watchable. They choose the leading female in movie the most ugly actress possible (I remember the delicious cat lady in Batman Returns - Michelle Pfeiffer), how can two hansom guys fall in love with her ? The story is twisted without any logic , in a forced need to surprise you (but it just becomes irrational). There are so many bad things about this movie that i could write a novel about them. The Gotham city is now a ordinary American city ! Why ? Gotham has to be Gothic !Conclusion : wait to see this movie only on a cheap DVD , it not worths more then 1 dollar !",0
"I am shocked how many people actually rate this movie. The whole idea of a Batman was dreamed up by Bob Kane to entertain kids - so the idea of making it into this 'serious' picture is laughable. Bale's acting is terrible as the man in black, especially the way his voice changes in costume. As for the Joker Heath Ledger - no menacing at all, in fact so far-fetched its pathetic. The Batmobile has now become nothing short of a Hummer, what are they gonna do next - use an M1 Abrams Tank? You can't have it all - a tense thriller with this many childish ideas just doesn't work. As for Gary Oldman - he must have been broke to get involved.",0
"Let me preface this by saying that I did not enter the cinema wanting or expecting to dislike this film. I had heard nothing but praise for it as a film, and despite my usual preference for less mainstream fare, I decided to take a chance in the hope that it might indeed be a great work of cinema.Furthermore, I should add that this may well be one of the best superhero movies ever made, and indeed, may even be one of the best action films ever made.So perhaps it is unfair for me to criticise this movie too heavily, inextricably bound by its genre as it is. That is to say, perhaps it would be unfair, if it were not so seemingly unanimously lauded by critics and fans alike. Of course, we all know that the Internet Movie Database top 250 is not necessarily a great reflection of quality, but even so, you would think that the film that now heads this list should at least be in the ballpark of the greatest movies of all time.In my humble opinion, it is far from it. Indeed, even for what it was, and what it was trying to be, I don't believe it was entirely successful. Sure, 146,000-odd IMDb users might disagree with me, but you've got to factor in the massive hype surrounding this film when viewing the critical reaction. It is worth asking, how will this film be viewed in 12 months? 20 years, even? Either way, let me address what, in my opinion, are the major flaws of the movie.It might seem unfair to criticise it for the genre to which it belongs, but I believe that the cinematic art has far, far more potential than the action movie genre allows it. For example, however well ""Road Trip"" compares to other films of its kind, it is still justly recognised as a poor film. Returning to this movie, I don't think you would find much argument in defining the action genre as depending upon explosions, cheap suspense, cheesy dialogue and formulaic/contrived plot lines. Can one fault such a successful and popular mix? I believe so, because popularity does not necessarily amount to artistic merit, and film is, after all, an art form.One of the cornerstones of a great film is acting. Heath Ledger's admittedly excellent performance aside, the acting in this film is not that great. Maggie Gyllenhaal is wasted in a poorly written role that does not allow her much to do, while Aaron Eckhart is never convincing, and even approaches hamminess once the big plot twist has been revealed (Which, while a good idea in concept, is made to look silly due to poor dialogue). Christian Bale, in the title role, is utterly uninspiring, Michael Caine (himself a great actor) is given a clichéd and predictable role, and Morgan Freeman's character seems to be there for little reason whatsoever.The plot, meanwhile, often appears contrived. There were several confusing moments (""Why is he here now? When did that happen?""). Sure, further viewings might serve to explain these apparent shortcomings, but my first impression was that of an average script. As for the ending, I'm torn between commending it for its idea, and condemning it for its silliness and blatant preparation for another sequel.Of course, the film is not completely flawed. As stated above, Heath Ledger is an unusually convincing movie villain, and I commend the film for avoiding gratuitous violence. The dialogue and acting, while at times poor, are probably at a far higher standard than most movies of this kind, and the story itself has some interesting concepts, and unfolds nicely at times.Therefore, in the realm of action films, it deserves praise. Even in the realm of Hollywood film, perhaps, it deserves praise. However, as a representative of the cinematic art form, it does not - and that, in the end, is a true measure of a film's overall quality.",0
"This movie will cure you. When it comes out on DVD, buy a copy, and keep it at bedside... Writer, why did you throw away the very dark, mysterious presence of The Batman? He should have continued as an almost demonic wraith, mentioned only in trembling whispers among the crime elite of troubled Gotham City. The Batman I remember from ""Batman Begins"" was a black, gorgoyle-like spirit perched high atop a building, overlooking his beloved Gotham. Awe...mystery...foreboding. Sadly, you snuffed out this hard-won characterization immediately with the confusing (very) first scene of, ""The Dark Knight"". Oh, and having The Great Batman bend the rifle barrel was textbook, ""Super-manish"", and only further illustrated just how impotent you had made him in this second installment.To bring out the darkness in this character, Bruce Wayne/Batman must go through some personal crisis...a defining moment. This never seemed to fully materialize. I wasn't saddened by the death of Rachel Dawes, the sacrificial lamb.Writer, if you must kill off the love-interest, wouldn't it have been a good idea to introduce us to a replacement for featuring in the third installment of the Batman saga? And Maggie Gyllenhaal was a replacement, herself! Hopefully she was only intended as a place-holder, all along. If there were any heterosexual couples who turned out to see Ledger's last performance, it was likely the female who decided that she and her boyfriend/husband visit ""The Dark Knight"", drawn by the promise of a romantic element (...later, when some of these marry, she'll also choose the wallpaper). I know that for some time, readership of the comic was likely male-domninated. But hey, we have ""talkies"" now...haven't you heard? Wave bye-bye to any chances of a return visit from these couples, as the female has a firm grip on certain things, including her man's wallet. Movie-going is still accepted as a cheap date. However, cheap + movie with no romance= tuh-RU-bul! Didn't ""Mary Jane"" make an awesome contribution to the tangled web of a certain nerdy, lovable arachni-boy? Are we learning anything at all from the ""Marvel""-ous competition?Though I, among many others, love Morgan Freeman, and can appreciate any effort to draw the Afro-American dollar, ""Lucius Fox"" does leech away one of what little ""powers"" Batman possesses...his ingenuity. He once made his own crime-fighting toys. Now even this has been stripped from him. Batman hangs by the toes perilously close to ""average Joe-ness"". He has no real super-powers...and what he did have, you, writer, stripped this from him. There once was a looming, midnight monster threatening the evil of Gotham. Now the Bat has been skinned down to a pathetic, fluttering, squeaking thing...your aim with the stake was unerring, writer...dang, Christopher! Haven't you been told to never work with family??!!!The Joker: cuddling a puppy one minute, splashing in a puddle of his victim's gore the next, and back again in the wink of an eye. But Ledger's Joker? Plain vanilla. He seemed to have played this madman with some timidity, as if he feared being perceived as goofy...giddy...both aspects of who we know to be the Joker. He should exhaust us with his homicidal mood swings; keep us off-balance all the time. Ledger's characterization of him was ""flat-line"". Not even a blip. And writer, you missed a golden opportunity to characterize him, as he walked out of the hospital he was preparing to demolish. He was already dressed as a nurse, and with his makeup all askew, the picture would have been complete with the addition of some big, fuzzy pink bath slippers on his feet. Then, boom! I must confess that although it would be just like the Joker to blow up a hospital, this choice is a bit unsettling in this day and time. Reality suspended my disbelief at that point.Christian Bale himself attested to just how uncomfortable it is...running his voice through the gravel so as to sound more like a butt-kicking good guy...and it shows. Very contrived. Bruce Wayne requested, and, of course, received, a suit built for greater flexibility. However, I don't recall the advantages of this new suit having ever been revealed to us. Why even mention it in this overly-long movie? I do realize that this, combined with Two-Face shooting the Batman in the end might have been meant to horrify us that, in addition to a dead girlfriend, we now have a dead hero, but we are too confident in ""star-power"" (the one power of The Bat you haven't yet negated...). This ploy, if intentional, just didn't work out.The soundtrack drowned out what might have been some memorable lines uttered by Commissioner Gordon, as Batman roared away on his totally merchandiseable ""Bat-Cycle"". This seemed to have been an omnipresent problem.Okay, okay. ""The Dark Knight"" had a big, big weekend. Figures. Ledger, hero of the gay community, dies before the official debut in theatres. The gay and lesbian dollar makes a resounding ""ching"", but it doesn't make this movie any better. It stank, regardless. The reactions, or lack thereof, of the audience in the packed theate confirmed that it was just a big, sprawling, boring mess. I almost dozed off three times. And here lies yet another cherished comic book icon...mangled.",0
"...but I got through it over three sessions. I almost gave up and deleted the recording after the second session but I stuck with it.The movie started out OK then gradually got bogged down in an increasingly non-entertaining and implausible plot. The special effects were good, I'll give it that. Then it ended and I could cross that off my ""will watch again"" list.Like many modern movies the dialogue was hard to understand so I had to use subtitles to follow what was being said.",0
"As I was driving north to Chicago to visit my sons, I heard rave comments on talk radio about this movie. On opening night people were lined up at theaters to see the show.So, I decided to treat my son and grandson to this event. We went to the 11:45 p.m. show and had to wait in a line for 1 hour after buying our tickets.Now, almost right away, I became bored with the movie storyline and the layout of the presentation of the scenes. Why?#1. The scenes were choppy. Not enough time was spend focused on the actor's faces to develop good audience rapport with the characters. #2. The actor's dialogue was limited. I felt that there were too many one-liners which do not lend themselves to stretching the talent of the actors.#3. While I recognize that the storyline was about a dark side of Batman and unlike the more campy versions before it with Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, and Kim Basinger, I felt that I was wishing that the movie story could be more like the prior Batman films. At least the director of the previous Batman story treated us to good images of the characters and allowed adequate face time of the stars so that you could identify with them. The Dark Knight was much lacking in this regard.#4. For waiting in line for 1 hour until permitted to enter the auditorium and being subjected to at least 30 minutes of movie previews and advertising, I felt that this also tended to tire out the audience in addition to the 2 hour and 45 minute movie on top of the waiting!#5. And, the romance angle was lacking to say the least!So, if you liked this movie, fine. My 11 year old grandson liked it because there was lots of noise and explosions. And, seeing the streets of Chicago allowed me to identify with places that I have been to in that city. I, however, would have preferred a much better acted movie. I found myself dozing off in the auditorium seat. I do hope you liked the film. I did not enjoy it all that much. Any Academy Awards for this film would be ill advised.Larry from Illinois",0
Boring and weak. Not being nasty but I think Heath Ledger got a sympathy vote. He is no way the most psychotic killer I've seen in a film!! If you want to watch an absolute nutter at work watch Wolf Creek ( 2movies and two series) this film is the most overrated film of all time.,0
"Why so serious? Why make another movie! I'am an avowed Batman fanatic, I'm talking from the Adam West/Burt Ward days, on through Tim Burton's 1989 masterpiece featuring the aforementioned duo, after that film it seems that the Batman movies became quite dumb. Batman Begins I felt was completely unnecessary as along with Batman Returns, Batman Forever and who can't forget Batman and Robin! The content is always rehashed into an even grimmer format than before and Batman always gets new toys and for some reason Michael Hough turned into Michael Caine! Christian Bale's ""hoarse"" rendition of the bat-voice was completely foolish and I could never take his mouth movements while he spoke in this 'dark' tone too seriously at all. I never cared for Heath Ledger as an actor but his performance as the Joker I'll say was pretty good, a little kooky but far from the intensity that Jack Nicholson or even Cesar Romero for that fact could provide! Michael Caine I'll admit was a nice touch as Alfred, he had a few funny lines ('Courage juice' for example). Never cared for Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne at all, very cocky and undeserved, Aaron Eckhart's role as Harvey Dent/Two Face wasn't even necessary, only to let the movie continue longer than it definitely needed to. These DC comics movies are getting dumb and dumber each year. I praise the individual who was gripped by these performances amidst chaotic bunk because it takes a strong willpower to deal with all that garbage at once. What was up with Batman's new toys? And the fact that he could disappear and reappear anytime he wanted, a little stupid. At least Tim Burton's Batman was designed with a little more realism. If I really wanted to suspend my belief of reality and go into drone-mode for a little while, I think I'd watch some Saturday morning cartoons instead. Five stars because the cinematography was very good and Heath Ledger left our world with a very startling last performance, R.I.P.",0
"about 40% give this a zero. Even if the Loved it group all gave it a ten, I think that this makes the movie about a 6. Still too high in my estimation. If you can't give zero, you certainly can't give negative numbers. Worse movie ever, especially considering the budget. I kind of get the Heath Ledger business. Especially after Brokeback Mountain. Which was a remarkable performance. But that's it.Maggie Gyllenhall just disappears. Gary Oldman, a lovely baddie. Who came up with his character. Did he realize how bad this movie was and boycott it. It's been a while since I've seen it, and I actually thought that I should see it again to try to understand what the fuss was about. Its a phenomenon that I don't quite understand. Encourage your friends and acquaintances to have a really painful experience as part of a bonding process perhaps.",0
"It has got nothing special. It is like any other boring superhero movie. I slept while watching it, though, Heath ledger's performance was quite impressive but the screentime is so boring.",0
"If you're a casual movie-goer who's not a fan of reading comics, then sure, this one will hit all your sweet spots. As an enthusiast of comics and its history, it's a hard watch. It's very clear that the writers and producers wanted a movie that features all of Batman's cool moments throughout comics without truly capturing what makes Batman a superhero vs the hyper vigilante we have in this movie and its sequel. Why did no one stop his cringy Bat-voice?",0
"Like many others I've always been so confused as to why this movie is praised so highly. I believe Batman Begins is superior and I don't even hold that film as one of the best Batman films. It seems like it was due to Heath Ledger. Listen I loved Heath Ledger too but I'm not going to go give all his movies a 10 just because he passed on. Everyone dies eventually people, get that through your thick skulls... Ok moving on to review..I'm one of the biggest Batman fans out there. He is my second favorite superhero behind Superman. With that being said I like to think I have a wealth of knowledge on this stuff. My issue with the Nolan Batman films was they were trying to be too real! This is supposed to be fantasy. But you can still bring realism into fantasy without losing the fantasy. To me it went too far away from why I love Batman to begin with. They were in a city that was called Gotham but it still looked like regular ol Chicago! No amazing Gotham statues, building structures just boring.Christian Bale was not intimidating as Batman, as a matter of fact he was actually quite comical on most scenes. Even people who claim to love the movie stated that Bale's Batman voice was comical. So again how is this the best Batman?! Batman is not supposed to be comical in the least. This is a man who seen his parents killed in front of him and that trauma stayed with him his entire life which made him become Batman. Imo the trauma aspect of Bruce was done much better in the 1989 Batman film. It really showed the extent of how it messed him up. When Michael Keaton put on that suit it was no smiles, no games. Just a man in a batsuit filled with trauma and vengeance.Which brings us to the costume. Many consider it the best Batman costume. How? From most angles it looked ridiculous on Bale because the mask was too big for Bales head. I think it would have looked better if they shrunk it down to fit his head more. It ended up looking like a Halloween costume to me. Nothing innovative about it imo. We didn't get the cool grappling hooks, no cool gadgets, and Batman did not feel like a detective. He actually came off kinda cocky and pompous on most scenes. Batman can be an A-hole but overall he has a big heart. I did like the Bat tumbler because that makes more sense for batman to have a tank and not just a regular car.The story was not well paced. I found many parts boring and i never understood if it was trying to be a superhero movie or a cop film. Overall it felt more like a cop, mob film with batman thrown in here and there. Plot holes... Oh im joker and im going to throw Rachel off a building. Im batman im going to dive after her and chill with rachel on top of this car not caring that Joker still up there potentially about to kill all these people. Again how is that good story telling?Heath Ledgers performance was superb. Great, believable Joker. Don't really need to say anything about that except I wish Heaths Joker had been funnier. But again a great Joker performance does not make a great Batman movie. There needs to be all elements that make a batman film good not just one performance and praise because of the mans death. Overall I think Batman Begins is superior and I also have issues with that film. I personally do not hold up the Nolan trilogy up and I don't believe it will age well. I think in the future most people will consider the trilogy lackluster at best.Here are my top 3 Batman films that I believe are superior to the dark knight. These will remain my favorite Batman films until a superior Batman film come along. Seeing how they just cast Robert Pattinson as Batman we may be waiting awhile. Nothing against Robert I just don't see him as batman. But of course he may surprise us and I will give him a chance.1. Batman 1989
2. Batman Forever
3. Batman Mask of the Phatasm",0
"The production design? Boring. It's just a city. Where's the gothic architecture and personality Anton Furst showed us? Acting? Mediocre. Christian bale is laughable, you can't get past the stupid voice. Ledger is okay but nowhere near as fun to watch as Nicholson. Cinematography? Not memorable. Music? Barely there. It takes a ridiculous concept and tries to make it serious, which ends up laughable. Burton got it right. Setting a dark tone but still in a fantasy world. It doesn't take itself too seriously because it isn't silly. Two guys parading around in Halloween costumes.The only decent thing in this film is the practical effects, and the half decent directing from an otherwise competent director.",0
"I love superhero movies. Always have. But I'm not a comic book reader. So, apparently, the dark knight is a darker new Batman that appears in the comics. Having said that, Batman has always been my favorite superhero. But I stick with the original batman with the great gadgets and supercool antagonists.
I must admit I also saw the first 2 Batman movies with Michael Keaton. To me, the only 2 movies worth watching. After him, they've had to change main actor in every movie, because the role is just too big for them.
So dark knight is a very angry, confused and pathetic Batman fighting your average psychopath. I mean, isn't the Joker supposed to laugh, have exploding toys, demented jokes and an extraordinary criminal mind? The whole movie, the ""joker"" didn't laugh. Not once. He has no sick brilliant scheme to take over Gotham. Nothing that would suggest a Joker.
So two pathetic characters and after a awhile, you just want the movie to end.
A veritable waste of time.",0
"This movie is the holy grail for edgy 13-year old edge-lords all over the world. Heath Ledgers Joker is irritating and shows signs of herpes, Rachel is the worst character ever and Batman is played by a lunch-lady who have smoked cigarettes for 40 years. Nolan can not direct a action scene even if his life was depending on it. The dialogue in the movie is cringe-worthy and is written to appeal to middle-class anarchists. ""The Dark Knight"" (1994) is the definition of Anti-intellectualism. The only good things with the movie is that The Batman suit is kind of cool and that it has a fetching title.""I can sooo relate to the joooker""",0
"Saying The Dark Knight is the best Batman is inept because Christopher Nolan do not respect the mythology of Batman and recreates one of his own. The best Batman to me is Batman Returns, the second Tim Burton with Danny DeVito. The Dark Knight has very complicated plots with a big mess of a story (just a good excuse to blow a maximum of cars and buildings), is very self conscious (one of those films that try to explain you everything with dialogue instead of showing it) and sometimes terribly shot. Heath Ledger is a great and sordid Joker but sometimes the camera moves so much you can appreciate his acting. Two Face and Scarecrow are underused and do not have enough gadgets. They're also very realists just like Gotham City (not very Gothic here) and that leads to little imagination. The Honk Kong scenes reminded me of Lara Croft. Bruce Wayne is introspective and moody in the comic book, here he is a bit too happy and cocky. Batman's voice is absolutely ridiculous. The Joker is an amazing character, nihilist, unpredictable and absolutely mad. The acting is very good, especially the actor playing TwoFace and Eric Robert)Although some of the framing and the camera movements are really ugly by moments, most of the cinematography is beautiful especially the night scenes. (Grey, Black and lots of mirrors everywhere). It's good entertainment for sure, the action scenes are breathtaking, the CCI and the make up incredible but I wouldn't place The Dark Knight among masterpieces like The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction or Star Wars. Funny thing is the Batman costumes still looks like Michael Keaton! What Batman needs is someone like Roberto Rodriguez.",0
"The movie was good but to have it rated as the top 10 movies of all time is absurd! If you are a child or you like movies that you just sit and watch like a zombie... this is your top 10 movie! Come on a superhero move being in the top 10... are you kidding me. I can't believe people are putting it in the same league the God Father, SS redemption, LOTR... the list goes on and on. I have to say the graphics are some of the best I have seen. The actors played their parts great. I just thought there was not much story line. If you like movies with substance I would wait until it comes to a movie channel or video.",0
"One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.
WAY too long; an absurd, confusing, unnecessarily complicated ""story;"" annoying characters, & boring action sequences.
You know it's bad when it
gets to a point where you
aren't even sure what's
going on but you don't
care enough to try and
figure it out!
And what is
with the ridiculous voice
Bruce Wayne adopts when
he becomes Batman?!
Almost makes me yearn for
the days of Michael Keaton.
And that's saying a lot.",0
This is by far the most over rated film of all time it dose not deserve a place on the top 10 list in my opinion not even the top 100,0
"The dark knight. Many people say that the dark knight is a great movie. But honestly we don't see how, as the first scene is in the middle of the day. What movie called the dark knight involves the day time. It doesn't end there the movie also involves a joker and a 'Knight' and is not set in medieval times. It just doesn't make sense how a movie involving two of the most recognisable medieval characters has 0 medieval scenes, in fact it is has nothing medieval about it at all as even the characters with medieval titles are not dressed accordingly. Not only this there are also many plot holes such as how does burning 809349301600.00 Jamaican Dollar achieve anything other than deflation. The character two-face is also misleading as he only has one face, granted half of his face is burnt but so is his whole body, so why not call him half burn or something. It is a stupid name. Overall another misleading title leading to a disappointing movie",0
"This movie in my opinion was kinda all over the place, and quite hard to follow. the way its directed makes the movie more boring than exciting, however the scenes that are action packed are amazing. the movie was too long for me and i lost my attention for it. I'm not the biggest fan of ""superhero"" movies, i feel that they could have done way more things with the budget of the film. The part that's good is Christian bale is a good batman and heath ledger made a killer joker. if you're a die hard batman fan, this is a must watch. Maggie Gyenhall is quite annoying, i feel like her character was irrelevant and did not contribute to the movie plot as much as she could have.",0
"Ask anyone on the street what the greatest comic book/superhero movie of all time is and they'll say ""The Dark Knight"". Ask me the same question and you won't get the same answer. If you want the same answer then ask me what the most overrated comic book/superhero movie of all time is and that's what you'll get. There's no denying comic book movies are the most popular type of movie in the last decade or two with Marvel and their cinematic universe dominating both the genre and the box office and they get a large amount of attention. But then there are movies within the genre that get too much attention. ""The Dark Knight"" is that movie. Now I've never been a fan of batman and dislike has grown because of the countless fanboys on social media making out that he is the greatest fictional character ever created and they always cite TDK as the greatest batman movie and greatest comic book movie ever made. So after talking with a friend, I decided to give it a watch and I was left confused, wondering how people bang on about how wonderful it is and rather underwhelmed by it. Christian Bale's batman was so difficult to understand without subtitles, the action was no different from any other superhero movie and the plot was nothing special. That being said, Two-Face was a good looking villain (better than Tommy Lee Jones' version) and as expected Heath Ledger's Joker was actually quite good, Joker is the only thing to do with batman I like and I've always loved Mark Hamill's Joker and Ledger's was a good 2nd place. As nasty as it sounds I feel a lot of the movie's success comes from the fact that Ledger died before the movie was released (I felt the same about the last ""fast and furious"" movie with Paul Walker), it's a good movie but better than other classic movies like the original ""Superman"" ""Jurassic Park"" ""E.T."" or ""Back to the Future"" as a lot of these fanboys suggest? No way whatsoever. Is it the best movie ever made of it's genre? Absolutely not. Should future movies be more like TDK? There are elements that can be adapted yes but no not every movie should be like TDK. Should the fanboys shut up entirely about the movie? Definitely.",0
"The film is quite good and interesting currents, but in some places too too tight. The film is worth seeing, but only just to kill time, and super glamorous, exciting pictures from this the movie is not worth waiting. The fact that this film was not planned to be so it was just a pursuit of money. They turned a great comic book hero in a strict, sullen slut.The main villain in this film is nearly inactive. I certainly understand that it's a movie, and I can say this is a film about fictional characters. but in this movie, a lot of really stupid acts.But can like this movie, but for me personally it is very boring, so my rating is only 5",0

One of the most boring superhero movies and movies I've ever watched and i barely watched it because it was putting me to sleep. This movie is so boring that calling it a superhero movie would be an insult to superhero movies.Its about some guy that talks dumb who is trying to get a clown but can't until he tries to bomb boats. Boring movie that went no where. All 3 are boring wasteful movies.DC hasn't learned because MOS WW and JL were also great lullaby movies.,0
"Pathetic, just a bunch of contrived ridiculous action scenes strung together with a weak story and plot holes everywhere. Even though it is a fantasy DC comic it should at least make some sort of sense and entertain. This is just mindless explosions and fights and completely unbelievable action sequences with not even an attempt at logic or plot. Disappointing to say the least.",0
"I'm not a big fan of Batman tho, it's just alright But this didn't even get me closer to being a fan, rather it pushed me farther. What was that?",0
"I just want to say that I liked all the Batman movies (yes even the Kilmer/Clooney ones) and didn't think it was possible to not get entertained while watching Batman on screen. Well, the day has come my friends.This movie was awful. Entirely too long. It could've ended 8 times before it actually ended. This caused ""stop and go"" viewing which was really aggravating.Another big complaint was the amount of explosions. Granted, one of my favorite movies of all time is Terminator 2, which had the same number of gratuitous explosions, but I never felt like I was watching a movie, I felt like I was part of the story. This, on the other hand, was excruciating.Also, we all know that Batman is the world's greatest detective. So why did we only see one scene where he did detective work (the bullet in the wall scene). Outside of that, he was just fighting using the same hackneyed ""back of the fist to the face"" style or on the uber-crappy bat cycle.Just one more then I'll shutup. Is it just me, or did anyone else just want to buy the Joker some chapstick? Seriously, he licked his lips entirely too much which took focus away from the scene. Honestly, if he did it one more time, I was gonna rip the screen down.However, despite all these minuses, there were some very awesome effects. Two face was done brilliantly and to watch batman coast on air was truly amazing. Everything else just didn't add up.In conclusion, this movie is worth the rent, that's all. If you like superhero movies, save your $9.50 and see Hellboy 2. If not, just save your money, because this movie sullied the good name of Batman and makes a mockery of what the past movies have established.",0
"Cons: Since when did Batman talk like Cookie Monster? I couldn't even understand what Bale was saying half of the time. Seriously, there's a difference between hiding your real voice and Cannibal Corpse try-outs. The plot was terrible, and they ""modernized"" Gotham City. Sonar and Cell Phones, now he can see like a BAT! Really? They didn't even show how and why he could see in the dark using the ""pre-made"" sonar capable bat mask. You've GOT to be kidding! Then there's the ending, which seemed to me like a huge rush of different movie clips they had saved for outtakes and random lines that, absolutely, had no real meaning, just sentence fragments of what has happened and what will happen. Batman isn't supposed to be looked at like a cop killer, which is what the ending basically insinuated. They ruined Batman, and our culture is eating this crap movie up like imported chocolate.Pros: I did, on the other hand, love how Christopher Nolan hardly used any CGI in the film, which brought realism to the action sequences. CGI is ruining films and it's great to finally watch one with ""real"" objects being destroyed. The only great thing this movie had going for it was Heath Ledger by a long shot, he carried and stole the show in every aspect. At times, he reminded me of Brandon Lee. Truly Epic.R.I.P.",0
"First of all TDK surely surpassed every hype made before. An amazing acting of a crew assembled, beautiful direction made this movie memorable. I stunned to watch the scene in which Batman was flying with wing after jumping from that amazing designed building. It had never been used such beautiful scene before. The whole movie was full of thrills and overall impact was so laud. But the trump card of this movie is the card of joker. A joker usually comes in movie or drama to put an element of entertainment in it.But many time many director use it to express some complex thing, because common audience can also understand the language of a joker. I remembered very well about my childhood that I could understand only part of the joker in drama which I saw then. Hence V for vendetta or or others of same type movies put their things beautifully in front of common of common audience. The Joker of TDK have also to say something to this common people but he show his dark side.The character of Joker in TDK is the best of all time joker.Heath Leather, we will miss you. Nolan is a great genius.",0
"I don't care it's better. Knock knock, boomerang guys stop hating",0
"Saw the movie 7/20, not very good at all, quite disappointed given all the hype, but the theater was packed. Plot was a mess, hard to follow- I couldn't tell what was going on much of the time, some of the characters such as joker and most criminals were nasty, but I kept getting confused with DA if he was good or bad guy, as well as others, and it really got muddled at end with who was insider etc. Frankly, I didn't care. Can you believe I caught myself dozing a couple of times? It's that kind of movie- lots of action and things happening, but you could drift off and just more action would be happening, so what did I miss? Too many things that defy logic- I mean, come on, so many criminals ""afraid"" of the Joker, they wouldn't dare touch him? When he blows up hospital, which police just evacuated, wouldn't some police be on scene and then they could shoot him? I too didn't like the lead actress, Maggie Glyndehaal (spelling?)- she was very tepid, nothing that would excite me, no passion just boredom. Most of the characters were not very compelling- even Batman wasn't anyone that made me sympathetic or like him. Who the hell was Morgan Freeman- what function did he have? Did they just add his name to attract viewers as he's usually a good draw?Not very good- I should have asked for my money back.",0
"I don't think this film necessarily deserves two stars, but this is more of a reflection on how it definitely does not deserve the rave 10/10 reviews I've seen on here. So consider it more for balance. I'm no die hard comic book film fan but I've watched a fair few as I live with people who are. And I can't believe how few people have mentioned Bales voice. It is absolutely ridiculous. It takes away all credibility the film tries to have. I wanted to cringe and laugh at the same time whenever batman spoke. Not only is it overly gruff like a child pretending to be scary but it also sounds like Batman is trying to speak whilst in the dentists chair having a check-up. Bale can't even do it right! I just don't know how the entire production crew filmed the whole movie without thinking ""this doesn't work"". It's worth watching for Heath Ledger but that's about it. It's also 45 minutes too long",0
"The Dark Knight has a haunting score, stylish direction, and an Oscar-worthy performance by Heath Ledger. Why, then, couldn't Nolan have allowed the film to catch its breath? The film is a constant climax, building toward nothing. And the supposed ""climax"" feels manufactured and out-of-touch with the rest of the film. Many scenes seem like they were awkwardly cut off and many questions are left unanswered. And after 150 minutes, Nolan needs a good ending. He doesn't have one.This film only cements my position that Christopher Nolan is the most overrated director of our time. Inception was another good idea wasted.",0
"And that comment is just the start of what is wrong with this movie. Given the incredible amount of hype that surrounded this movie because of Heath Ledger's death, it was inevitable that it would disappoint to some extent. But I was unprepared for just how badly it would disappoint me.Don't get me wrong, I love the franchise, and Batman Begins was a fantastic revitalisation of it. But TDK fails to live up to its predecessor for a number of reasons.Firstly, what the hell happened to Gotham City? Was there no budget for set design? Where is the Gothic architecture that was artfully blended into the modern in BB? All gone in favour of shiny modern buildings.Next, just how many subplots does a film need? TDK has loads. And each one is not fully realised, leaving you, as my summary suggests, both wishing for a longer, more rounded movie and at the same time wondering when it will end.The acting is pretty good, but it's not Oscar materiel. Heath Ledger makes a good Joker, but I'd hardly call it his best performance. Likewise, Bale seems content to just do his Batman thing and not give us any surprises. In short, nothing special.The effects are good, and there is action enough to keep you watching, but the subplots tend to break up the flow of it all and get in the way.The mobile phone ""sonar"" network was ridiculously over the top in a movie franchise that was trying to be more ""realistic"" and to be honest, that was the final nail in the coffin of this film.Likewise, when I look at the ratings this film has received, I guess I'm in the minority in not liking TDK. But that's alright. I guess not everyone has the ability to see past the hype and tabloid build-up and it is easy to get seduced by what they have been told is ""a great film"".To see this at number three on IMDb's list of top movies is just nerve-gratingly wrong. Let's just hope the next one will be better (and actually deserve to be labelled as such) SUMMARY: Too long and yet not long enough. A tedious plethora of subplots most of which are not necessary. Overall rather dull and tiresome.",0
"Two hours after leaving the theater, I'm still not sure if I enjoyed The Dark Knight. It avoided coming across as overblown crap like the later ""original ""Batman movies did with Val Kilmer and George Clooney, so that was good. Heath Ledger as The Joker was entertaining to look at. I for one didn't miss the corny jokes that his character traditionally cracks. The make-up on Aaron Eckhart was superbly done and probably warranted a PG-13 rating in its own right.Still, it felt more like a Die Hard movie without all the wisecracking: too many explosions, too much implausibility. It seems silly to pay money to see a movie about a billionaire who dresses up as a bat to defeat criminals and then complain that certain parts of it aren't believable, but the implausibility was too hard to ignore.A lot of other reviewers have done an excellent job of cataloging the unbelievable moments, such as the suit that is vulnerable to dog bites but breaks falls from high buildings and The Joker being able to kill a guy with a pencil. For me, it was the larger problem of The Joker explaining that he likes creating chaos to strike fear in the hearts of ""the planners"" or something to that effect. It sounds like something a madman would say, and what is scarier than a madman who acts at random? The problem is, almost all of the Joker's evil deeds required an incredible amount of detailed planning and anticipating how the law enforcement would react, not to mention the amount of cooperation it would have taken to set up all the bombs in the buildings and boats.That glaring contradiction made it a Not Quite Good film for me. Plus, even though it was really long, it seemed like Batman didn't do much except for get bitten by dogs and ride around on a crazy motorcycle that was part Transformer and part Tote Goat or some other contraption hunters use to haul dead animals back to camp. I think I managed to block out the part where the cell phones make Batman's eyes light up like he's in God mode in Doom II. That was just plain ridiculous. One other hang-up: it was hard not to think of No Country For Old Men every time there was a coin flip. Let's just say if you had to take a shot every time there was a coin flip, you'd be passed out with 30 minutes of movie left.It wasn't a bad movie, especially factoring in that this is like the 6th Batman movie made in the last 20 years (how many other movies that are the 6th of anything could be considered remotely watchable?) Still, with all the hype, I thought that visually it would be on par with the Gothic look of Tim Burton's Batman. It wasn't.My suggestion: see it in the theater, but make sure you aren't the one paying for your ticket (as I wasn't.) Your enjoyment of it will increase roughly 300% if you see it for free. Just don't give it ten stars on IMDb. It's not one of the 100 greatest movies or even 250 greatest movies. It's not even the greatest Batman movie.",0
"WHAT is all the hoopla about? The Dark Knight is a mediocre film that drags on too long, has too many plot lines, and action sequences way out of step from Batman Begins.It seems like the screenplay has too many ""edits"" with plot lines that sprout from nowhere for seemingly no reason. The filmmakers should have done what James Cameron does: stop production because the story starts to suck, and rework it.The Dark Knight's basic premise is that a deliciously creepy character named ""The Joker"" wants to kill Batman so that he can get a huge piece of a mobster-group's money. Sounds good, but the story starts sprouting uncontrollably with little plots here and there which the film tiresomely follows to all their useless ends.The action sequences are totally over the top, way out of step with Batman Begins. In Batman Begins, much of the action, or physics, is somewhat believable yet far-fetched. In The Dark Knight, it is science fiction.Does anyone die in this film? There are lots of gunshots and beatings, but nobody seems to die. People seem to die then come back from the dead. People are implied dead, then we see them again later. When one character does die late in the film, there were so many others who became ""undead"" that I seriously expected to see them again later. It was farcical.Maggie Gyllenhaal is TOTALLY miscast as Gotham's District Attorney. In Batman Begins, Katie Holmes was the D.A. and was MUCH more believable. Gyllenhaal, on the other hand, has the softness and sweetness of Katie Couric, and I don't believe her at all especially in the painful moments she tries to stand tough against crime.Heath Ledger was good as The Joker, however, he did not achieve the depth of character that Jack Nicholson does in the original. Ledger seems to be a ""one-note-wonder"". Creepy, yes. Very creepy and dark, but on a shallow level. I think that more than anything the poor editing of the film is to blame for that.The film has some positive sides. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are all excellent in their roles.Cillian Murphy makes a brief appearance as Scarecrow (who knows why). While he is a good villain, his character makes a humorous comment about diagnosing Batman after he is caught in a drug bust which seems totally out of character for him.The film goes on, tiresomely, with more characters, more villains, more action. Like an oil spill gone amok, The Dark Knight seemingly has no end.",0
"I know by reviewing this movie with and honest opinion, I'll upset a TON of batwagon nerds but I don't care. This movie was so boring I literally fell asleep half way through for a few minutes. I've never been a big ""batman"" or comic book super hero fan but I went to see this one when it came out because of all the hype. I wasn't into Batman begins either but I figured this one would be better because of all the hype and Heath Ledgers Performanc etc.. god I was wrong. I can definitely admit that it's a very well made movie but god it was so damn boring and dull to me and NO I don't have to have tons of action like stupid transformers. I don't know, I'm not a huge Nolan fan which is weird because I know he's a good director but I usually don't like his movies. Didn't like Inception (I know right? What a weirdo) only one of his I liked was Memento and kind of liked interstellar but that one was sorta boring too. Anyway I am well aware I'm n the minority on this one but I don't care. Being honest!!",0
"What makes comic book movies so appealing was sorely lacking in this edition. It wasn't' so much the acting that disappointed, but the overall ""feel"" of the film. In ""Batman Begins"", Gotham City had a surreal, dark and mysterious quality that this film abandoned. In this segment, Gotham was portrayed as any ordinary big city (like Chicago, hint, hint). It's as if they wanted to ""normalize"" the story, and bring this other world into ours. I go to movies to escape, and go to a place for a few hours where these super heroes can exist. By taking away the dark element, it's just a guy running around town in a bat suit. Christian Bale, who is a good actor, was under utilized in this movie. The two characteristics of Batman that make him a super hero are his fighting ability, and the gadgets he uses. The fight scenes are sub par, and the gadgetry was all but non-existent. Heath Ledger's performance, though very well done, was wasted, and I blame this on the writing/directing. What makes villains appealing in this genre is that you usually have a point of reference to identify with. They were good people that are betrayed or exploited, for instance. So even though you dislike what they do as villains, you can kind of understand. I know they were going for a darker, more sinister Joker this time, but I think they missed the point. Maggie Gyllenhaal was completely miscast. She offered nothing by way of talent or glamour. Aaron Eckhart did a fine job, as did Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman. They should have been used more. All in all, this movie was a miss. There is no way that this is the best movie ever made, according to the IMDb ratings. It's not even worthy of the top 250.",0
"The Dark Knight...The best, worst, most thrilling and most annoying film I have ever seen.The best...for a movie that is unoriginal and is classed as a ""sequel"" this film puts 'Aliens' to shame. It is undoubtedly the movie of the year. De Niro and Pacino might come close but I highly doubt it. Unmatched tension and passion for this theme since 'Se7en'.The worst...The cut-aways...nuf said. They took the mick. This movie was made worse by the money grabbing, box-office watching, sit on their arse office types that just want £6 a ticket from every John Nobody that wants to watch a movie. It should have been an 18. There should have been violence and there should have been controversy. Instead us movie boffins are annoyed, the 10 year olds that wanted to see their hero on the big screen is lying in bed shitting themselves because one of the most phenomenal actors, in the most amazing role, has just woken them up with his laugh.The Most Thrilling... Edge of seat...check Mouth wide open moments...check High octane action that makes John McClane look like your mum...CHECK nuf said. It was thrilling to watch.The Most Annoying...Non-movie lovers would find irony funny, humorous. They let product placement and in-movie-jokes go straight over their heads. I on the other hand do not. Irony is something that should be used precariously in a movie of this calibre. Yes when the irony helped the plot, great. When it made the audience laugh but had no proper use, that wound me up.OK so to summarise. A star studded, underrated cast, delivered stellar performances, with the exception of Michael Caine who also annoyed me. The script, written by two of the greatest brotherly minds. You think brothers you think Wachowski and Coens, but the Nolans have written Memento and now The Dark Knight. They are great. The director, Christopher Nolan, I have no problem with. Great direction, great light placement, no faults that were obvious. All in all, top class. As for the editor and his ""Bosses"" I believe they have turned a potential History making movie into a complete catastrophic sham.",0
"Well I had great hopes for this movie and it didn't disappoint. Heath Ledgers role was the best I've seen from him. Its a pity that he is no longer with us to see the popularity of this movie, however people are clearly feeling more for this then they should be because of Heaths death. Great supporting actors, not to much over acting but a bit notable towards the end. It was great to see the process of catching the joker was played out pretty much like its suppose to go, the cops catch the bad guy and the DA prosecutes with the help of Batman. That's where I thought it would have been a great time to finish the movie, the next 45 minutes after that I lost all interest. Unfortunately like so many movies today too many special effects and non believable circumstances make it a real let down. I would have loved this movie more if it didn't go for so long. Would recommend seeing it, but not a favourite in my books.",0
"Well I finally watched The Dark Knight. And I'm left in total disbelief that this movie could be rated so highly. It was a standard action flick. No cleverness, no 'wow' moments, no twists, no plot. Nothing. Every scene was standard. A typical scene is the Joker confronting a group of bad guys, giving them a speech about how he's a better criminal than them, killing a couple of them, and then leaving by-way of a trick device. And Batman's scenes were all like this too. 2 1/2 hours of this. It got very boring.That pretty-much sums up my review. There's really not much else to talk about. Everything was standard, and it got boring. The only reason I even gave it a '3' was because it's a comic-book movie, so I gave it a free-pass on not making sense. For instance, Batman and the Joker can both pull the perfect device out of their pants at any given time, and they can both get anywhere (through security) at any time, without any logical explanation for it. If it wasn't a comic-book movie, I'd have rated it a '2'.Lastly, I'll just speculate as to why this movie is rated so highly. Don't discount my review because of this, as I'm not saying this last part of speculation is the truth. It's just guessing. I'm guessing because I can't fathom why this movie is rated so highly. There has to be some other factors involved. Perhaps it's:An pre-existing overwhelming love of Batman.A pre-existing love of Heath Ledger because of Brokeback Mountain (which endeared him to movie critics)....and sentimentality following his death.The 'all-star' cast. There's bound to be someone you like in this movie. Everyone loves Morgan Freeman, for instance. He's tossed-in this movie for no apparent reason.The 'message' that there's a blurry line between good and evil. Movie critics love that message. Me....I found the Joker's constant speeches about this to get very tiring after a while. And his voice was annoying.",0
"Ledger's joker nothing special, no better than Nicholson! Grossly overhyped and overrated.
If a film is good, I will remember something about it, even years later. The only thing I remember about this is the joker was violent and murderous. The film was not enjoyable in the least.",0
"A rich guy dresses up in a bat costume and punches guys. Truly the Citizen Kane of action movies, if by action movies you mean dumb movies with bad action scenes. Sure it's well made, but it's also over serious and underwritten. Heath Ledger's performance is the only interesting element of the movie, which is amazing considering how poorly written his character is.",0
"On a scale of 1 - Poor 2 - Fair 3 - good 4 - Excellent 5 - superior Heath Ledger's performance is a 3. You have to wonder if the 9+ rating DK has with IMDb viewers is a sympathy vote. Notice that people under 18 give DK a 9.3 and people over 45 give it an 8.3. Call me and the +45's old fuddy-duddies but just maybe we have been around a while and know what quality is - DK is OK but not worth 9.3. Heath Ledger's performance is about a 7 - Jack Nicolson's Joke, in my opinion, was much better. The portrayal of evil is a 4 (Excellent) but the overall story, subplots and getting to the end is armatures even for a comic book hero. Also if I had to rate the 3 male leads performances it would be: 1 - Christian Bale 2 - Aaron Eckhart 3 - Heath Ledger",0
"I saw this movie a while back, and was underwhelmed at the time. After watching 'Joker' yesterday, I decided to compare the two Joker performances (Heath Ledger vs Joaquin Phoenix) and gave it another go. The joker performance is good, but it's not enough to make up for the rest of this train wreck (Actually, I think a train was the only thing NOT wrecked in this movie).I had forgotten how vacuous and mainstream The Dark Knight actually is. The usual explosions and special effects extravaganza to divert attention from a lack of any depth whatsoever. This movie left me completely unmoved, in contrast to the Joker. Well, I will admit I was increasingly angry, but not at the villains, rather at the people who made this pile of bat guano. The trivialization of violence and complete lack of plausibility that is so common in American movies is at the forefront again here.Nothing special, other than the effects. And after 10 years, even those are lame.",0
"I admit I'm not a comic book (or comic book movie) fan. I prefer more realism or something resembling reality so maybe I'm not the best person to review this but since there are other folks like me out there, I want to warn them.First of all nothing is believable in the film and the casting is horrible. It is full of eye rolling silliness and over-acting. Even Christian Bale, an incredible actor, is dreadful in this. Truly cringe worthy. I can't focus on anything but that ridiculous voice he did for the character. It's like an SNL skit. What was he thinking? And why did the director allow this to continue?Second, Maggie Gyllenhaal is so poorly cast it's distracting from the movie. I'm not going to say she's a bad actress, she's not, just poorly cast as a love interest for Batman. And juggling two dudes? I'm sorry, she's cute, but she just does not have enough going on for all that.And third, I know this is an unpopular opinion but while Heath Ledger was great as the Joker (he was always great), it was hardly his greatest role. It's almost sad to me that this is what seems to define his career rather than Brokeback Mountain or Monster's Ball. I guess it's just a reflection of the popular culture of today and how over the top super heroes and villains are appreciated more than realistic character studies. Heath was a fantastic actor, so is Christian Bale, but these roles certainly do not showcase their actual talent. I blame that on the director not the actors. The director should have yelled CUT as soon as Bale spoke and halted production until it was fixed. Heath did the best job humanly possibly with the script and character he had, no doubt. But I personally never believed this character and I never felt scared or anything. I blame it on the directing. But then again, I don't get the comic book thing. But the overall role and film can't be compared to what Joaquin Phoenix did in Joker. Sorry. I know Heath has passed on and he was one of my favorite actors....but truth is truth.The Dark Knight is probably amazing to younger people who like fantasy storybook kinda stuff but it's hardly the kind of movie to fulfill a middle aged adult. The film actually annoyed me so bad I had to fast forward through parts. I just don't get the raves to be honest.",0
"I had the honour of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie valiant. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crown jewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something bees wrongs with yours!",0
I thought this movie was trash and bad acting......,0
"Very fast past action, lots of explosions, fight scenes, very batman. Watch if you want.",0
"Poor characters, plot and story. Top actors but weak performance.",0
Dark Knight was dark but was able to focus on a theme to show how much he hates guns and how heroes must sometimes play the villain because they are the hero and that is how things get done and I love Freeman and the many weapons and I love how the Joker did and does all he did. This is probably the better one of the three in that trilogy.,0
"When I viewed this film, I was aware of the hype, and was especially excited to view Heath Ledger's acclaimed Joker. And frankly, The entirety of the film disappointed me.First off, I believe that Heath Ledger's performance was only as big as it was because he died (does this qualify as a spoiler?) soon after. If he had lived, people likely would not have liked it as much. Second, the whole series has problems (Batman committing genocide in Batman Begins, the fact that he would have accidentally blown up Gotham in The Dark Knight Rises) with the story, this film had many more. Why were the fake Batmen faking Batman? Why didn't anyone notice an extra man in the 21-gun salute? And does no one care that Batman just MURDERED Two-Face? Apparently not.Which brings me to point three. Why was Two-Face included? I believe it was only to sell toys. But the performance of this character leads me to my proposition in how they could have fixed the Dark Knight trilogy:1. Fix the fact that Batman committed mass genocide in Batman Begins 2. Cast Willem Dafoe as Joker instead of Heath Ledger 3. Don't kill Dent in Dark Knight 4. Scrap Dark Knight Rises and have a film about the interesting foil that Dent represents to BatmanSo all in all, this film was disappointing, but it could have been saved. At least it will always be better than anything that Zack Snyder can ever come up with. And Heath Ledger will always be preferred to Jared Leto.",0
"Sorry to be a discordant voice, compared to general appreciations for the film, but I found the film very mediocre. Of course the virtuosity in the action scenes is there, and some are truly spectacular (like when Batman goes to Hong Kong to capture the banker of the Mafia), but the total lack of credibility makes the movie confusing and never really exciting. The viewer is never able to forget he is watching a movie, to be immersed totally in the story, to feel a breeze of truth. And the beauty of cinema is all there: in creating the right conditions to unlocking this feeling of total immersion in the truth (even only for the duration of a few seconds). And above all, the film lack a deep meditation on ""good vs evil"", although drafted in a rather crude and clumsy way. The battle should have been more ""internal"", in the heart of the Batman character, knowing that good and evil are similar, but that the search for harmony is above everything. However, we are probably asking too much for this movie, born in an era in which the cinema is still unable to find the beauty of the films of a recent past, when you went out of the theater with this feeling of having lived a touching experience. But this is an era of great changes and men are evolving rapidly, sooner or later this evolution will also be ""reflected"" in the seventh art.",0
"This movie is a climax of nihilism. In its construction it's incomprehensible, chaotic and sloppy; the tone is negative, the acting uninspired; and yet it is, paradoxically, unbelievably overrated. If this is what people esteem nowadays, then I pity for them - what is their perspective of life?How distant this production is from the original version of Batman I have seen, in the sixties; or, for that matter, the comics themselves! An overkill of sound and images must cover up the lack of story. And how 'skillfully' the sphere of the Batman original has been murdered. No courage, no honor, no romance left. Do people really believe in this vision of darkness? Or is it a perverted sense of heroism, in respect to the deceased Joker Heath Ledger? Increases the death of youth icons the validation of their productions? Should that be so, then how poor and unstable a basis that is!Seldom my time was wasted like this. For its technical efforts, I reward 3 out of 10; reluctant, however, in giving any appraisal whatsoever.",0
"I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling ""for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!"" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10",0
"I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDB's top ten list (currently #2). At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are: they're in prison!The film is decent, but it certainly isn't what I would call great or extraordinary. There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable. Characters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and sometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the narration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for the ending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a prison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of it.This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair. If that's your thing, you'll love the movie. It's not really my thing.5/10",0
"What's going on here? At the moment I am writing these words The Shawshank Redemption is 3rd in IMDb's all-time top250. I don't think the movie is particularly bad, but to rank it even in the Top50 is a crime against a lot of brilliant film makers further down the Top250 and even more people whose works don't even appear on the list!So now I ask if anybody can please explain to me: 1) Why is this movie's average rating over 9? Does it appeal to some basic American sense of justice and love of happy endings? 2) Why did more than 65.000 people rate it? I'm pretty sure it wasn't nearly as commercially succesful as The Lord of the Rings or the Godfather with about 50000 votes. Did it do well on video in the US?And if you REALLY feel like watching movies about people behind bars why not give Cool Hand Luke or the 1974 classic(!) Caged Heat a try?I don't mean to demean The Shawshank Redemtion or anything, but I just don't get it's massive rating. Is this one of the most overrated movies of all time? Well, according to the statistics of this, the odds are that you do not think so. But would you then please be so kind as to explain it to me. Feel free to email me.",0
"Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so.  It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination.  I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama.  Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this.",0
This movie is a total piece of manipulation. It does have a few redeeming features though - Morgan Freeman's narration all through is pure art!!! This guy acts with his mouth!!! As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it. But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time - really? C'mon!!! Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realistic.The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true. There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in place.This is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesn't require any thinking. Personally I like a bit more depth and reality.I don't want to put people off seeing it - it should be watched once. But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features.,0
"This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentimenttossed in. I really don' t understand the fuss. I guess some peoplelook for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling, palatable materiallike this. That's the only explanation I've got for the unwarrantedpopularity of this flick. Production credits are fine enough, as is theacting but it certainly doesn't belong on any repsectable list ofgreatest films of all time.",0
"I've been content to lurk and learn on this web site for months, but after reading the reams of glowing critiques of this film, I felt obligated to get an IMDB account and print a contrary point of view.The Shawshank Redemption is an obvious, thinly characterized, visually uncompelling film.  Whether it's the good guy/bad guy cliche or the  white guy/black guy cliche, it's still the same old Hollywood.This is not a film which discovers life through enigmas, dilemmas, and reflections.  It is a film which wears its rather plain message on its sleeve.3 out of 10.   For prison flicks try Dancer in the Dark.  Someone else recommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool Hand Luke.  I heartily agree with those choices.",0
"Come on guys! According to the IMDb Top 250 THIS is the second best film EVER!! Better than Citizen Kane? Better than Godfather Part II? Better than ALMOST EVERYTHING?!?!No, it's a very, very long, very, very predictable, very, very cliched, very. very old-fashioned and sentimental film, blessed by some good performers (especially James Whitmore, who, alas, does not figure prominently enough.)It worries me that many of the comments  here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare, when in actual fact, it wallows in all the conventions of its genre.I give it 6/10, mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.The only people who could mistake this for a Great Film, would be those who mistake the works of Stephen King for Great Literature.",0
"I cannot possibly realize why this movie is rated in top movies. There is nothing new in this film and there isn't anything in it that makes it special. Wake up people! Quote Bill Hicks ""Piece of Sh*t"".OK I'll give it that there isn't anything to complain about the acting or directing, etc. But this entire movie seems to be a compromise. I also think that the success of this film is based on the ""least worst principle"" and that makes it bad.I'm also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music. All this seems like fishing Oscar nominations. Am I really the only one who can see how transparent this is? I doubt it so please vote movies that really will make difference.",0
"The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s.  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people.  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger.  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white.  Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn.",0
"This bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number 2 spot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought votes for it. Trite , mawkish, shallow, unconvincing, ugly... How much more can I say about its awfulness? Morgan Freeman is tolerable, Tim Robbins is not. There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual. If they aren't there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie. There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense: emotional, dramatic, logical, racial, penological. Rips off the Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them. Its appeal escapes me utterly. For the love of God, sink this film!",0
"This movie is annoying in several ways.  The criminals are all goodhearted, thoughtful, sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad guys.  gimme a break.  What is this?  Dukes of Hazard? (which was far better than this).  Further, the plot is so, so, so predicable.  Good guy outsmarts the bad guys and real justice is served. spare me.  I know, a lot of people love this flick, but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of time.",0
"I have a good friend that I can discuss movies with all day. Generally we have very similar tastes and critiques. Shawshank, is the only movie we completely disagree on. This movie insulted my intelligence from the first minute. All the prison clichés are painfully represented in this one film. The Innocent lead character, the benevolent inmate friend, the evil warden, the sadistic guard, etc.. Then of course you are mesmerized by the hackneyed subplots and obligatory scenes (i.e.) the attempted rape. About the only ingredient not thrown into this proverbial soup was a football game.This movie has some fine acting and direction, but considering its big name cast and production, the product is sophomoric at best.",0
"It bugs me that this movie is rated so high- not because it's a ""bad"" movie, but because it's a mediocre one. Apparently, mediocre people reward mediocre cinema. This movie tanked big-time when it was initially released, and with good reason. It wasn't until pseudo-intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto ""favorite movie"" for Lowbrows world-wide that it started dominating the IMDb ""best movie"" list. In reality, ""Shawshank"" is like a sewage pump for every idiotic Prison Movie cliché ever made. Every guard is a monster. The warden is religious, therefore Evil. Not a single prisoner is actually guilty, or if they are, they're so obviously redeemed that we're supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment. Murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as Opera plays over the loudspeakers. Right. The whole movie is so fake, so smarmy, and so condescending that it's no wonder that so many Americans, (with their odd addiction to fake, smarmy, condescending things) consider it their ""favorite movie"". I guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear.",0
"This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.    The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience ""It's all about TIME and PRESSURE..."" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.  While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art.",0
"That this film ranks as No2 in the 'all time' list on IMDB says a lot for how folks don't watch films from any era before the 90s anymore, for how else could it genuinely sit atop that list? I suppose in an age where everything on amazon gets at least four stars, good subjective criticism is proving harder and harder to find...but really...is this film better than Chinatown? Better than Casablanca? The Third Man? Mean Streets? Withnail and I? Better than Adam's Rib, Singin' in the Rain, Rear Window, Day for Night, Bande a Part, Taxi Driver, West Side Story, Les Quatre Cent Coups, Some Like it Hot, Seven Samurai?I've seen this film twice, once at the cinema and once on TV as I lie stuffed with Xmas dinner. The first time was mildly enjoyable, the second pretty turgid. Despite the presence of the ever excellent Robbins (though Morgan Freeman phones in the same performance he's given in every film ever since), this film never transcends the humble source of its story - a Stephen King short - and whilst it's a 'nice' tale with a reasonable twist at the end, can anyone else explain to me why such praise has been heaped on this utterly average experience?And it's not just IMDB. A recent UK Channel Four poll found Shawshank right up there. Perhaps it's the combination of pseudo-harsh prison story and a buddy tale along with the lashings of on the nose humanism that appeals across genders and other boundaries. I don't know. But believe me, if this were the 2nd best film ever made in the world ever, let's just say cinema wouldn't be the popular influence it is today.Go out there, people. Find the true 'classics', find the films this piece of sentimentalia stole its every beat, every note, every word of dialogue from. And then come back and tell me this is anything other than a hotch potch, a 50s throwback with a 90s sentiment.",0
"It is strange that this movie is 2nd in imdb chart, as it is the same old american story, where good people win, and bad guys died. More strange, the USA is still the place where this story must sound more false.",0
"!!Spoilers to this movie, as well as to Sixth Sense and Citizen Kane just for spite!!Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that oozes with ""give me an Oscar pleeeeeease"" all over it. You know the type  - like ""Dances with Wolves."" Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has such a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white (prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed and hashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of states, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at Shawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can deny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not going to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he had in him by watching, say, ""Nothing to Lose"" (which nevertheless is a better movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are incredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the bad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that although he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow inmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent away, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause ""that'd be a fairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank."" How wrong he is! The whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and fast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two main prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and warden who all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and the evil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural baseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the hidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced sadism, mind you), an hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a philosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is Good? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard songs which have more depth than this movie!) And half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the ending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies have an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to interpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at least five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some room for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as if it's saying ""you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not let you think about anything at all."" Even if that was true, it's quite insulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could it not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine if the Sixth Sense was called ""The Dead Psychologist"" or Citizen Kane was called ""The Sled"" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job harder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long and boring. It's not a movie that is ""slow"" or ""moves at its own pace"" - those are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but not a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But still.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance. It's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of what Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for swearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat you to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for unoriginality!",0
"Why do you like this so much? It steals directly from every other GOOD prison movie I've ever seen: The Great Escape, Escape from Alcatraz, Midnight Express, you name it. Because it allows the hero to be raped it's somehow brave or profound or heaven forbid realistic. Far from it folks. The work of hacks, only the MAIN performances are redeemable. How 'bout that warden, quite a 3 dimensional character that one. As are all the peripherals. Its bad, but in an average hollywood way. Of course it's overblown but it entertains decent enough in that much. Nothing memorable, infact I'd have forgotten it totally if it weren't for the persistant and oh so undeserved praise heaped upon it. But hey if it does it for you more power to you. Just don't talk about it's ""power"" in front of me, I may puke.",0
"Shawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue. It is accessible. Regrettably, as is true in so many cases, popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this picture's actual quality. The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message, impossible to be offended by it, impossible to be confused by. However, as this review should show, it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by ""Shawshank.""The story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers. The complex coincidental frameup, the daring escape, the clear cut definitions of good and evil. the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline. Each step more unsurprising than the last, each beat more clichéd that the last. Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters, they take the most obvious road. This might be excusable if the road didn't also lead to the most obvious destinations.People also praise the acting in the film. While it isn't at all bad, it's hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles. Stereotypes when acted well are still boring.I sincerely hope that over time, when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors, it will become clear that it offers nothing new, and that what it does offer it doesn't even offer all that well.",0
"There are some things in this life we will never understand... How did the universe begin? What happens to our souls when we die? How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?In the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the reasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And cliché-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.The movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic cinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman, one of the very best actors working today.As for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250. I think it's outrageous how highly it's ranked here. Even the folks who made it would think it's ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made.",0
"Shawshank is on TNT approximately five million times a year. It is the second-highest rated film on IMDb, and it was nominated for seven Oscars. It is a movie that can make grown men cry. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver great performances. Thomas Newman's original score is beautiful. It's an engaging film about perseverance, friendship, will power, and hope.But then again, does it really belong in the same company as Godfather, Godfather II, Schindler's List, and other consensus top-ten films? Is it really one of the ten best films of all time? First off, the villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a ""pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil"" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was. The Warden is pure evil, and is willing to kill the prisoner who can help prove Andy's innocence in cold blood. And yet, even though Andy is the one man who could expose him and all his criminal dealings, he doesn't do the simplest thing and just kill Andy. Why not? Because Andy has to wind up hugging Red on the beach years later.Secondly, think about the scene where Andy locks himself in a room and plays classical music over the loudspeakers to the rest of the prisoners, who stop in the courtyard and stare up in awe and wonder. Are you kidding me? The scene tries to be a powerful, emotional peak in the film, but it comes off as laughably implausible, even in the 1950's.Finally, the movie makes it a little too easy on the audience by giving it all the answers. Is Andy guilty? Does he really escape? Will he and Red ever meet up again? Nothing is left for the audience to wonder about, no ambiguity _ everything is spoon-fed to the audience in tasty, happy-ending bites, right up to the final ""hug on the beach"" scene. Wait? this movie ends with happy people hugging on a beach? Yes it does.",0
"''He that lives upon hope will die fasting.'' - Benjamin Franklin Frankly, I really don't get the praise for this film. It wouldn't even be in my Top 250. The only thing my spouse has been able to glean from researching the topic on the internet is that psychologically people seem to like the film more and more upon repeated viewings. Well, that and Morgan Freeman's calming voice. Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism, to be honest. Not to be an alarmist, but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like ""From Caligari to Hitler"" by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazi's after World War I. There is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears examination.",0
"After seeing this movie I could not notice to be misled by the IMDB rating. The movie is nice, even good, but no way it should receive a 9.0.The movie could easily have been produced by Disney: strong moral & a happy ending. Sure, there are strong points. The scene of the old man who have been imprisoned for almost his whole life is very well placed and Tim Robbins' performance is good but the story itself does not leave anything behind. 3 out of 5. That's all there is to it.",0
"This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top 250, let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time. It is rather dull, extraordinarily predictable, and filled with clichés. This is not even the best prison film, let alone #2 among all films! Cool Hand Luke or Papillon anyone? I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Freeman & Co. do not disappoint), but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating. The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a (apparently) gullible audience. Help bring this down to a reasonable position so that more deserving films can attain their proper recognition.",0
"Saying this is the #2 movie of all-time is like saying McDonald's makes the best hamburgers. They're both palatable, predictable, inoffensive products that are easy to digest. Both have happy endings-- that is, if you find the stunning speed with which a McDonald's hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a ""happy"" occasion.All you need to know is that Shawshank has the exact same ending as ""Trading Places."" So why not make ""Trading Places"" the greatest comedy of all-time?? What the hell, why not make it #3 on IMDb? It too is competent and utterly middle-of-the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre.Instead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil, we get Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It's the exact same ending! Shawshank was OK when I saw it when it came out. But count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the 6-7 rating that it deserves. Thusly, I hereby cast my symbolic 1-star vote.",0
"The basic story for this dreadful movie is Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner i think am missing something with this movie, having now seen it twice. Its 1 of the most predictable boring movies i have ever seen. The bit were all the prisoners stop and listen to the opera music is just laughable. This just would not happen with hardened prisoners. This is also one of the poorest performances i have seen from Morgan freeman, why he took this role on i will never know. Go watch the Green Mile, its much finer work from the duo of Stephen King and Frank Darabont",0
"This film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the ""standard"" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre.",0
"Another one of those overlong morally right-on movies that never rises above average - saved only by the acting.Its bleeding-heart politics 'dignity of individual maintained in adverse conditions' is played-out well enough but actually lacks any real dramatic tension.Dufrane is a two-dimensional character who seems to go through the drama by numbers - there's never any doubt that he will triumph in the end, it's only a matter of how.Tim Robbins has done many more interesting films than this one - try The Player or Bob Roberts if you're looking for drama/moral ambivalence and how they interact.Basically, there are a lot better prison films than this one - Jailhouse Rock for starters.Like most Stephen King stories - quite prosaic. There was a story in here somewhere but it got over-inflated and somewhat lost along the way.
One to watch on a rainy day when there's nothing better to do.",0
"I'm not going to tip toe around it, this film is crap. Its completely unoriginal, its not artistic, its not demanding (except for being boring). You will not learn anything about the world through this film.This film is not a part cinematic history, unlike nearly all other films in the top 250. It is predictable and emotional crap.But even if your not into cinema, and you just like popcorn entertainment there are far better movies out there...basically any on the video shelf.",0
"just read the title. Tough I think it's a pretty decent movie (but not as good as the Stephen King's novel) i just can't understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 (with the exception of the godfather). To be honest i don't even really think it should be in the top 250. Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it's too much anyway. Come on, this can't be better than Welles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical valuation of the movie. This is a political statement.",0
"This is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption would place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second.",0
"I would humbly suggest that before praising or damning the ""Shawshank Redemption"", that one take a considered look at the New York Times ""Best 1000 Films Ever Made"" list. Unfortunately, the guidelines of this site preclude me,oh gentle reader, from giving you the URL. One should be able to Google it, so all is not lost.The NYT was good enough to excerpt the list from Peter Nichols' The ""New York Times Guide to the 1,000 Best Films Ever Made"".What ? The ""Shawshank Redemption"" is not on this list, you say ?Perhaps, humble viewer, you haven't seen enough films of the first rank. But, have no fear, this is a remediable condition. But, be a dear and do try to see some of the movies on the list,please, before voting on this site. I really hate to see so many people make the mistake of voting for the wrong sort of movies onto the top 10 of IMDb's very interesting site. It's ever so declasse.Remember, an educated public is an informed public. Now, do your part.",0
"Obviously I missed the point of this movie.  After years of people telling me how fantastic it was and noting how high it regularly comes in opinion polls, I finally watched it recently.Somehow I seem to have come to completely the opposite conclusion to almost everyone else.  Maybe my expectations were too high but I was very, very disappointed.  The plot was predictable and dull, the directing pretty droll.  Not much else I can say about it, other than to ask people if I have missed something key that would alter my perception of this film?Who am I to go against the vast popularity of this picture?  I must be the exception that proves the rule. This (apparently) is a ""must see"" movie.",0
"Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A. I can't believe that people like this movie so much. Yes I am biased, I really don't like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this ain't one of them. This is your basic prison movie. What can I say- it has the host of usual characters.  The storyline is basic, the outcome I won't say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie. I didn't think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini. I wouldn't watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so. One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher.",0
"This drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is.",0
"It is the performances that stand out in an overlong, sentimental and cliche film. The acting in this film is nearly flawless. Tim Robbins' understated performance is outstanding and Morgan Freeman is his equal. But to what end. Acting alone can not save a film that is overlong, (It feels like a 20 year sentence) has a hokey plot and cliche characters. Bob Gunton's insufferable Warden Norton and Clancy Brown's Captain Hadley, are as cliche as you can get. The Shawshank Redemption is a typical sentimental Hollywood fantasy, that takes itself way too seriously. As opposed to some of the more lighthearted and brisk Hollywood fantasies, which are far more easier to sit through..",0
"Overrated. Whiny. 8 million better movies. Stop being sheep. Tim Robbins is a hack. Morgan Freeman is a c4tface. Guy goes to prison, Guy escapes prison. Somehow tunnels through concrete and s**t without anyone noticing. Guy leaves some s**t hidden for other Guy still in prison. Other Guy gets s**t. Some stuff happens in prison between those events. One dude is all emotional and stuff in a rainy scene. uhh what else.. Not much else. Morgan Freeman's character had a hardon for Tim Robbins. I dunno what do you want. This move was lame. Very long too. Could've been 30 minutes tops and still got its ""point"" across. Frank Darabont sucks. The walking dead sucks. The end.",0
"The acting is adequate, the story is adequate, but why all the fuss?It sometimes baffles me why some movies get such high ratings when they are really only run of the mill.This is not that bad a film, just seen it all before.",0
"How many narrative monologues has he done since this ""epic"" film was made ?50? 100?I was thinking of setting up a data base to store them in.How much storage space is there in The Cloud ?",0
"Shawshank Redemption is overrated. It's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great film.The inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are monsters. Also as Freeman's character says: ""You know that everybody in here's innocent?"" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.This is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them too much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it.The Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the top five films of 1994. IMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and Léon.",0
"This movie is a mystery to me. I couldn't find anything exceptional on it. It's another HBO stuff, without any aesthetic achievement and It's absolutely conformist. But there is a fact: people love it. I want to be fair: the movie is OK, but people put it in the same place than The Godfather! Maybe I'm wrong, but it's not the best picture of all the times, not even the best prison picture of all the times. Now I'm remembering ""Cool Hand Luke"" or ""American Me"", they are stronger and wiser. But..people has the last word.",0
"Shawshank is nothing more than a fairy tale.  It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like.  People like fairy tales, so both these movies were very popular.",0
"Three words: ""Cool Hand Luke.""  Same film, done better, done earlier.  For that matter, is this film any better than other Steven King ""novelettes"" such as ""Stand By Me""? All in all, it probably ranks a 6 or a 7, but since people on this site have lost their minds as regards this film, I give it a 1 in one man's attempt at sanity.",0
"I don´t like movies about ""way of life"" or about a hope. In this movie is handled a problem with ""normal life"" or with resolution to take a life to ""own hands"". A topic of this film is such like Papillon. This is not an authentic subject, this is not an authentic movie....",0
"i had to comment, i really did, all those eulogies on what is in reality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film. Nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought- its purpose is to confirm every conservative, sentimental, instinct in us all. And yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities, and bulldozes these throughout the film. Really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original, and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length- ie life is hard, people suffer, but through struggle the human spirit will win through, learn to make friends and get their deserved reward - mmm. Nothing makes any of the characters real, and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant. It is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction, or that there is no humour, it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour, or than the real nature of friendship. Suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget Hollywood movies.",0
"After reading all the rave reviews for this movie, it turned out to be a real disappointment.  Can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all ""crooks""??  Haven't we overdone the hypocritical ""Bible thumper""?? -- let's find a more enlightened characterization.  James Bond, himself, could not have followed the main character's escape plan.  The ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from ""Cool Hand Luke"".  Enough!!!  Unfortunately, fine performances by both Robbins and Freeman were wasted in this ""fantasy"" story.",0
"The Shawshank Redemption is reasonably well written, directed, acted, and filmed. Yet in my judgment it is a below-average movie. It lacks a real plot, and, while the title promises redemption, nobody and nothing is redeemed. The characters lack depth, and many events are implausible.No doubt, wardens and prison guards can be wicked people. But those portrayed in this film are so completely perverse that they become uninteresting. Their function is to represent ""the establishment"" and ""authority."" The audience is meant to identify with Andy Dufresne, the main character. While innocent of the murders of which he is convicted, he's hardly an admirable character, and he becomes worse during his imprisonment. He's a clever manipulator who eagerly cooperates in the warden's criminal activities in the hope of profiting from doing so--which he eventually does. The prison also has has a contingent of homosexual rapists, who are called ""not human"" so as to avoid admitting that their behavior is all too human, and very much in need of redemption.Thus, the film's popularity: it appeals to our tendency to rationalize our own wickedness by comparing ourselves with moral monsters. Unfortunately, serving that function does not make a mediocre film great any more than serving sound moralism does.",0
"WEll I had high hopes for this movie.  But it fell way short.  I was hoping it would keep me guessing, but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen.  Though I did think the acting was good by both main stars.Jason",0
"With universal themes such as redemption, friendship, and good-defeats-evil tale, and without any significant technical flaws, it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption, one of well-done Hollywood flicks in the 90s by invisible employee directors, while it may also be difficult to find it compelling, imaginative, and inspirational. Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time, but this is made-in-Hollywood.",0
"awful. a dreadful disgrace. the film is the most cliched in cinematic history and is worthy of no respect. even worse is how it is so flawless yet it still is of no quality. i do not know how this film can be revered over others such as psycho, apocalypse now, raging bull, easy rider, the godfather, the killing fields, some like it hot and casablanca amongst others. shockingly horrendous",0
"In the early '80's, Stephen King read a short story by Leo Tolstoy called God sees the truth, but waits - a man falsely accused of murder is incarcerated and over the course of decades grows to be well liked and respected by the other inmates, and eventually someone shows up at the prison who can prove his innocence. Sound familiar? King promptly ripped it off and re-packaged it as Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The main difference being that in the Russian original the dude dies in prison while waiting for his release papers to be processed whereas Stephen King had to rewrite it to give it the cheap cheesy family feel-good Disney ending that Americans have been trained to expect from everything.Darabont substitutes melodrama for an actual pulse: Like the scene where Andy crawls through a quarter-mile of Diarrhea and comes out clean on the other side, oh Lordy Hallelujah all things are possible in America! (Jazz hands). And I hate to seem like nitpicking, but if you're gonna crawl through a tightly enclosed tube in a quarter-mile of s**t, you will either pass out from the unbearable fumes and drown in diarrhea, or at the very least, have your lungs filled with fecal matter and experience some severe adverse health effects, but no, Andy is perfectly fine because that's how that scenario would totally play out. Or the ending when Red is finally released from prison - ""Oh I hope I get to see my friend again oh I hope the sea is as blue as I remember"" - And then they meet on the beach and live happily ever after because that's how prison goes -- Thug Life.The movie is indistinguishable from anything else - It does nothing new - no new techniques, story structure, presentation. It is your standard, typical, by-the-book story. There is nothing to distinguish its direction - you could've replaced Darabont with Spielberg or Zemeckis and it would've come out about the same. There is nothing to distinguish it visually - You could've replaced Roger Deakins with another big name and it would've come out more or less the same. It could've been made by any director specializing in over-sentimentality, shot by nearly anyone, produced by anyone, there are no unique or distinguishable fingerprints on it.",0
"this film is very convincing hokum. nice, gentle, inoffensive and insubstantial story about prison life - I came away feeling prison was a place where nobody says f##k or fears bending over to pick up the soap. check out Freeman, in the token performance of his career, neatly basking in the falsely accused smart white gentleman robbins' shaddow. what a team... so very progressive. 'hope...' . oh yeah, we've got a lot of 'hope' going on here. The lush fantasy kind, so deadly sweet and full of bull. frank darabont is a gifted man who excels in making pretty pictures that strike at the very heart of american pie values and gives them a welcome support by elevating tokenism to its greatest levels in hollywood yet - that is no small achievement, considering... if you don't believe me check out his latest masterpiece, he just can't stop doing it. hell, why not! it sells tickets.",0
"Last week, I had seen ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn't understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.
In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't original -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor anyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes you're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.First I thought, I might not be a big ""prison"" entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with ""The Green Mile"" (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO's ""Oz"" which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you're wondering, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is another.)The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn't like ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", I find myself here at ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.All things are not wonderful to all people.And that's....a good thing.",0

"People wonder why I hate this movie so much, and I have to say that its just purely unoriginal.  I mean c'mon... how many times have you heard the story of a guy who's wrongfully accused of a crime and somehow escapes prison using a stupid spoon? If there's one thing I look for in a movie, then it's got to be originality.  I'll let it go if its based on a novel, or a musical, but c'mon... a plot this unoriginal doesn't deserve any credit!",0
"Watching this film made me think about the genre of ""prison""-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what ""shawshank"" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in ""the hole"" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say ""starwars"" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.Regards SimonPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

"I'm sorry but I just don't get the big deal over this movie. 
It is pure melodramatic schmaltz.  Give me Cool Hand Luke or Papillon any day.  Or how about Scum or even Chopper.I have to admit I felt the same way about The Green Mile, maybe it's just Stephen King's view of prison I don't like.  As if he has a clue!I think he should just stick with the coming of age stuff (loved Stand By Me) and the isolated looneys (The Shining), things he can obviously relate to.  Leave prison stories to the folks who actually leave their house.",0
"I too was dazzled by this movie when I first saw it; Robbins and Freeman were both fabulous and the story was an intensely happy marriage of the nostalgic and edifying to the tense and disturbing. The theme of success against the odds is rarely so emotive, and the desperate hope and yearning are truly palpable.But it's simply NOT the best film of all time! Parts of it are cliched, most of it is downright implausible. The symbolism is trite and way too in-your-face, particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out (albeit touchingly) what should have been the movie's duty to portray.The ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better than it's ever felt before. Films have every right to be manipulative, but when it's this blatant the magic collapses. Or did for me anyway.Mind you, still a smashing flick. I'm only nit-picking because everybody else seems to be in such a weird frenzy of Shawshank worship.",0
"I don't understand why this movie is so popular.  Yes, it was an interesting movie, and it was a good movie, but it was not spectacular enough to receive all the praise which it has.  The acting was good, and the plot original, but it was still a rather ordinary movie.  Apparently, I'm the only one with this opinion...",0
"I'm sorry I don't mean to offend people who like this film but what on earth is all the fuss about over this film it is nothing compared to The Godfather and yet people vote it as second to the number 1!? The Shawshank Redemption has a relatively simple plot ,dull camera work the script is full of soppy language (thanks to the overrated Steven King)that just isn't particularly clever in any way.The atmosphere of 'prison' is totally unrealistic all the characters are wimps.The only good element is Morgan Freeman because he's a good actor.There aren't any clever twists-for instance the 'mystery' of what is in the box at the end of the film is really unoriginal. Please feel free to argue with me over this but come on people step back and look at the film what is it made up of? Then look at The Godfather look at what that is made up of - Brill cast, excellent plot, damn good script, good directing and camera work everything is perfect then look back at the Shawshank redemption its just at a completely different level. Its quite ridiculous really.",0
"Good cast. Good story. The performances were excellent and there was both ample food for thought, and some very good scenes. Didn't hurt that i'm a big Morgan Freeman fan. Always top notch.On the other hand, overall, the whole film was far too unpleasant, preachy, and downright repugnant, to be terribly enjoyable. When the payoff at the end finally arrived, it just wasn't grand enough to overcome the feeling i'd just crawled through the sewer.And for this to be the #1 film on IMDb (actually second, but same score as #1 and with more votes) among far superior films like ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""Casablanca"", is ludicrous. This would never even have entered the remotest regions of my mind if somebody had asked me to name some really great films.",0
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so Hollywood cliche ! How can this be in the top 2 best movies ever ? I don't understand it. Avoid at all cost, this movie is boring !",0
"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this maudlin Hollywood package. The storyline is predictable; the characters and performances are one-dimensional; the dialogue is absolutely embarrassing (""Prison is not a fairy tale."" Ya think?!) If it would have been about women instead of men, it would have been dismissed as the schmaltzfest that it is. It isn't even courageous enough to admit that it is a gay love story. Tim Robbins should be ashamed to have taken part, for his performance was the most wooden I'd seen since Daryl Hannah in (insert any 80s movie she appeared in here). Morgan Freeman was even more dreadful and has been giving the same dreadful performance ever since. I don't expect much depth from Stephen King-inspired movies, but ""Children of the Corn"" was insightful in comparison to this dribble.",0
"At the time of this review, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the number one movie on IMDb. Why? If anything, it is probably the most clichéd film I have ever seen with my own two eyes, and yet it is rated as the top film of all time? It blows my mind every time I visit this website.This 'film' was adapted from a novel by the renowned author Steven King. I have not read the book, as I have already been spoiled by the movie, but apparently the writing is quite exquisite. However, Frank Darabont must have missed the entire point of Steven's works, which is to have engaging characters that you are able to sympathize with.The characters are so bland, I might as well be staring at glue dry. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's bromance literally develops right out of the blue after they have one conversation. Pacing? What's that? Later, you meet an old fart named Brooks, who might as well have his name changed to ""I'm going to die later so feel sad-larry"", and the most he contributes to the film is increasing the runtime with his sub-plot about being outside after being locked in for so long. One cannot forget the oh-so-memorable (sarcasm) warden who channels the spirits of every Disney villain without the accompanying song. You can find more interesting characters in a Tyler Perry movie.The worst part of the movie is definitely the passage of time. The story takes place over twenty years or so and yet the only one to actually age is the warden. Tim and Morgan stay in some special cells where they magically do not get older and therefore nobody notices on IMDb. While a competent director would have noticed this as soon as they glanced at the script, Darabont was off in the broom closet shagging the catering chick or something.If you enjoy modern shooters then you are in for a treat. Most of this movie is full of grays, browns, mixes between, and it even has a sewer section just for the hell of it. Just when you thought the movie might get interesting when out of the prison, prepare to be disappointed. Honestly, the best shot of the movie is when Tim is crawling through sh*t, as it reflects on my feelings towards the film.Music can make - or break - a movie. Here, the 'original' score only seems to try and make you cry at the most inappropriate times. The music is too overplayed in films like this, where it takes away from the already terrible experience.This movie is as lame as they come. If you like this, fine. As the phrase says, ""ignorance is bliss"".",0
"I don't dislike this movie, I think it's fine. Certainly it's not number 1, not even top 100. The movie becomes pretty stale mid way through and let's be honest there's absolutely nothing original about it.What I dislike most about this movie is the typically boring people who say it's their favourite for no other reason other than it's what they think people want to hear. Thus making them appear less boring.1 star because it needs knocking down a peg or 5.",0
"For the life of me, I can't understand all the gushing about this cornball, sentimental and PHONY movie.  There are certainly some strong performances, but they're outweighed by some of the two-dimensional portrayals, weak writing (that opera sequence -- oh, please) and most of all a completely garbage ending (I won't give it away) that stomps on what little credibility the movie has.I guess you really can't go broke under-estimating people's intelligence.",0
"I don't understand how this movie managed to get to Number one on this site. While it's a good movie with talented actors, it's just not as entertaining and solid as other movies that i believe deserve the top ranking. I enjoyed watching it, and it really doesn't deserve the 1/10 rating I've given it (thats only to bring it lower on the top 250) it just isn't as good as other movies I have seen and loved such as 'Trainspotting', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Donnie Darko' for example. These movies are solid performances with a strong theme in one direction, while I feel that The Shawshank Redemption flounders around with it's, slightly lame, hope and friendship theme, thats just not as entertaining as others.",0
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison. He remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named ""Red""( Morgan Freeman). I really don't see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time, the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing, it is pretty poorly directed, the plot is thinner than air,there are no risks taken,and there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie, in fact you wouldn't even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end. The title already gives away the whole ""big"" finale of the movie. I don't see how anyone could possibly compare THIS to actually great movies like EVERYTHING that is below is on the Top 25. And the simple thought of this winning Best Picture back in '94, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!, it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life, I still can't possibly see how the Academy could have even nominated this as the Best Picture of 1994. Anyway the only thing that saves the film of Morgan Freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still can't stop me from giving this a poor grade.2/10",0
"In my original review, I said that I didn't hate Shawshank as much as I hated the fanbase for making it the most overrated movie ever made. On rewatching the movie, my opinion of it is lower than ever. Nevermind how Andy's escape thru the sewage pipe doesn't make much sense (during the rain storm it would've been filled with water and he wouldn't have been able to get in, assuming that in real life they even had pipes people can fit into, or how anyone could reach Mexico from New England while there's a massive manhunt for them (which is called off unrealistically quickly) despite only a few hour head-start, and how in the hell does he just walk into a bank and walk out? His picture would be circulated by then)), everything about the movie rings hollow and false; it is Hollywood escapism at its cheapest and most artificial. I felt as nonplussed by it as ever - well, that's not true - the movie is supposed to be about hope and all that typical toddler b.s., but on this viewing I found it incredibly depressing. The movie is extremely depressing when you really watch it, but everyone always focuses on the cheesy, artificial fake fantasy ending, so they forget the bleakness of the rest. It's all the more infuriating when you hear of real-life stories like Benjamin Spencer, a man who 30 years ago was falsely imprisoned and years later, even after he was proven innocent, thru a loophole, they still have him locked up to this day, which makes me even more fed up with this childish b.s. complete crap movie for the masses. Or how about all those innocent people who died in the Nazi camps? No escape for them. The more you compare this melodrama to real life, the more infuriatingly empty it is. Also, Andy's escape feels completely unearned. You don't actually get a sense of Andy's suffering (he's unrealistically nonplussed by just about everything. He feels like a cardboard stand-in). For instance, he gets sent to the hole a lot, but the movie glosses over it - he locks himself in warden's office and Morgan just gives a one line narration of how he got sent to the hole for a week, but it just instantly cuts to him joining them for lunch. The only time you see him in solitary is when warden opens the door to talk to him later on in a brief 30 second scene. That's it. It's not like Papillon where you actually spend time with Steve McQueen in the hole and you actually see him breaking down, getting lines on his face, palpable distress worsening over time. You don't get that sense with Shawshank that just glosses over all that. Also, Andy's escape feels like a cheat - warden pulls away the poster and the hole is just there, despite us never seeing Andy working on it. It's not like Escape From Alcatraz where the whole movie is planning the escape and you actually feel the tension of times when Eastwood is nearly caught working away in his cell. In Andy's cell, the hole just magically appears there, since the movie never even indicates its existence - that's not a twist, that's a cheat. Warden pulling back the poster and seeing this tunnel there is the equivalent of how in Northwest Hounded Police, the Wolf takes a pencil and literally draws a door on the wall and just walks out. I heard prisoners like this movie well enough, but I would venture that's because of the escape fantasy they can relate to, not because it's a good movie. You can show inmates a poorly acted, shot, edited, prison break-out movie and they would still probably applaud if the character escapes. What does this even add to the prison genre? It's better than most prison movies, but what does it add?",0
"It is not uncommon to hire people to write reviews on social networks that should appear to be by independent contributors. That's why i had to laugh when i saw The Shawshank Redemption being the best rated movie on IMDb. But since there would be little sense in making such an effort to generate more than a million votes and almost three thousand reviews for a movie made in 1994 i assume this is genuine.In any case, based on Stephen King's novella, The Shawshank Redemption was an alright prison movie to watch. However, it displays what i see as typical for King's work. When he's writing science fiction, fantasy or horror it all sits well. But when he writes anything that should mirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton shirt and the one made of synthetics feels different. The events might have been based on actual events, but i haven't been convinced.Obviously when you make any kind of list, there will always be a first place. On IMDb it is currently being taken by The Shawshank Redemption.",0
"After seeing how high it was on 'best film' lists I thought it must be something great, unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. Sure, it was a touching story, great actors and of course a great ending, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed. Shawshank Redemption was visually boring and seemed to drag on for hours and hours without reaching any type of plot until three quarters into the film, and the plot itself was pretty unrealistic, sorry but what are the chances of him meeting a man, who knows the man who really killed his wife? ...unlikely. I must admit, its not a bad film and i'd watch it again just for the ending, which I didn't see coming at all. But I still can't get my head round why anybody would consider this 'the best film of all time' because it most certainly isn't.",0
"Shawshank Redemption is a story of, well, Redemption. Just like any film from Quentin Tarantino, but with an extra dose of melodrama. Orchestral music to drive you to tears, overly dramatic dialog, and plot twists that come so far out of left field even M. Night Shylamalan would cringe. You just have a hard time seeing them, because the movie is relatively laid back.Which is the best part of the film. It slows down whenever it needs to take its time. It's the story of two prisoners who bond over. One is a wrongfully accused man hoping to find a way out. One is a man who has given up all hope. And random acts of kindness help them earn their redemption.See, it's about Redemption. It's in the title. No use thinking about the theme. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast in this film, and gives one of the best performances in his life. But every one of his lines is not the line of a prisoner, but somebody who has been paid to pretend to be a prisoner.The movie lacks any sense of reality, from the poorly supervised chain gang, to the subplot of the sinister warden, and even down to the fact that a man is allowed to keep a tool made for chipping away rocks in his cell.The film would have worked as a stage play easily. Because we expect this detachment from reality. But this film likes to pretend this is reality. The film also likes to make conclusive statements, and then immediately retract them.This movie has a heart. It spills out all over the screen while we watch the characters monologue, getting to the point of the movie over and over again. Long movies never bothered me. On the contrary, I think it's a shame four hour movies never get released these days. Still, when it's two and a half hours plus of monologues reiterating the same plot point, it's two and a half hours too much.",0
"The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent example of Hollywood craftsmanship. It has believable acting, excellent pacing, good cinematography and tells the story in a very effective manner. But it is film as a craft, not as an art.To put this film in the same category as those of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Truffaut or Bergman is like comparing a piece of quality furniture to a Picasso.I doubt even one in a hundred people, who hold this film in such high regard as to vote it #2, could actually name the director if you asked them in the street.",0
"Let me start by saying that I always enjoy watching this film. It is perhaps one of the ultimate Hollywood feel-good movies. However, to call a film one of the greatest of all time, you need to compare it with many films of all types, and from many sources. This film is above average Hollywood fayre, and does indeed look very good compared to most of the over-hyped brain-disengaged tosh Hollywood produces.I am suspicious of most film top 100's, 10's etc etc in any case. They are as much a reflection of the average age and experience of those voting than any intrinsic value of the film.Withouit wanting to be disrespectful, anyone who feels this film uniquely opens their eyes to certain fundamental truths about the human condition, would do better watching Sondeburgh's highly accessible, but more profound exploration on love, loss, faith, hope and redemption ""Solaris"". The adventurous might also check out Tarkovsky's 1972 Russian version!",0
"The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters.  Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades.  All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250.",0
The problem with this movie is that it is to ordinary. It seems like the movie is just a cheap feelgood flick that has an ending that is easily predicted. I didn't care much for the characters and the narration was pretty annoying. I've read the book and it's a good adaptation. See it if your a Stephen King fan or like Dramas.,0
"I can't think of any movie more monstrously overrated than The Shawshank Redemption. Giving it only one star may seem harsh but considering all the undeserved praise heaped on this mediocre and dull movie I think it's fair. I watched it on TV and it is good enough for some entertainment for a few hours if you're too tired to do anything else but that's about it. It is predictable and unimaginative: innocent guy (well we never learn if he is if I remember correctly but as he is such a nice fellow we're supposed to think so), sexually assaulted, escapes and there you have it and that's all there is to it. Of course Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are good actors but I can't think of anything more nice to say about this movie.",0
"It's not a bad film.  It's just derivative and melodramatic.  It borrows from ""Cool Hand Luke,"" a superior film.  It relishes its significance too much.  It's a bit smug.  Morgan Freeman's voiceover is a clumsy narrative device.  I don't know -- I just know for sure it's not one of ""the best films of all time.""  Not even close.",0
"This picture is a rip-off from the Clint Eastwood movie called "" Escape from Alcatraz"" When you watch it carefully you'll notice the similarity between the two of them. And not only this movie is a rip-off , the Clint Eastwood's movie is also a stolen idea from the movie called "" A Man Escaped "" an old classic french movie.",0
"Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film of pretentious platitudes and obvious intentions.  Based on Stephen  King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", the film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongly accused of murdering his adulterous wife and her lover.  Morgan Freeman delivers a much-deserved Academy-Award nominated performance as the hardened Red, the convict responsible for smuggling cigarettes into the penitentiary whose genuine depth allows him to form a friendship with Andy not based on the macho rules of the prison yard (Andy's demeanor is in face so falsely naive that many of the prisoners bet on him to be the first under pressure) but on a continuing sense of willpower and motivation in a place that genuinely lacks the atmosphere for such human emotions.And yet whereas ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is in itself an honorable predilection of prison life and shows an understanding of the human spirit which is somehow lacking in the more recent prison movies (most notably Tom Selleck's ""An Innocent Man"" and Sylvester Stallone's ""Lock Up""), the film is deemed exceptional only by your willingness to surrender to Darabont's predictable machinations.  Darabont may be a talented screenwriter, and some of his creations here (such as the character played by William Sadler, who comes across during an inventory inspection a copy of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexander...Dumbass) are unmistakeably human, his portrayal of the Bible-thumping warden (Bob Gunton) cannot resist but to relegate itself to stereotype. The film's real downfall is in Tim Robbins' performance, who despite his squeaky-clean cherub face cannot project the inspiration needed to give this film its realistic element.  And yet this is not a bad movie, just certainly not the best movie of all time.  Some images of the movie will continue to stay with me: the cold-hearted sexual depravity of ""the Sisters""; and in the infamous shot beautifully and rigidly painted by cinematographer Roger Deakins (""Fargo""), Dufresne basking in a downpour upon entering freedom. Unfortunately, the film isn't cohesive enough to warrant any more of those moments.",0

"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said.

"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman).

"The score was composed by Thomas Newman and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1994, which was his first Oscar nomination. The score consists largely of faint piano music, and tremolo strings during more active or humorous moments in the film. The score's two main themes only appear two to three times. The prison theme, first heard in the beginning, is a four-note ascending line in the bass, which is developed and reaches its climax when Andy is standing in the river in the rain. The second theme represents freedom, and is first heard when the inmates are sharing beer, feeling like 'free men'. This theme does not reoccur until the final credits, and is then grander, with fuller orchestration. Zimmer himself has credited the score as the one ""that has influenced everything the most"", and stated that Newman expanded the harmonic palette of film score",0

"good film very interesting to watch. Age rating suitable to film genre.This i8s a strange thing to says about a film set in a prison but it has a way of creating a warm hold on our feelings Va's it makes us a member of a family.Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions.""Shawshank"" slows down and looks.It buses the narrators calm,observant voice to include us in the story of the men who have formed a community behind bars.it is deeper than most films;about community in a lifetime,based on friendship,hope,redemption and belief.The only their film to have moved me in such a strong way was ""To kill a mockingbird"".Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.This is one of those film's cancan watch over and over again and always pick up something new from.A must see film.",0

"A very good movie. It is possible that the men (adult males) will find this movie more appealing than women (adult females). Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give very good performances. In particular, Morgan Freeman excels like he seems to always do in his movies. I can never get used to the type of character that Morgan Freeman plays because of his versatility of roles he has played. The movie, although not fast paced, draws you in and keeps you interested. I could have sat through an additional 20-30 more minutes of film. However, the movie appears to be of sufficient length. Quite to my surprise, the ending was not entirely predictable. Older children (10+ years) would also enjoy this movie. This is not a chick flick so boys don't bring your date to this one. OK to share with long term girlfriend or wife though. This move does not inspire romance nor was its intent. A good film to sit down with popcorn.",0
"This film has great effects. That is about all I can say because I found its plot instantly forgettable. Slickly directed, it is a visual treat.Leonardo D. is solid as usual, Ellen Page is good but she suffers from looking too young to have qualified as an architect.I would struggle to think of any reason to recommend this film to anyone to watch because beyond the sight of Paris folding over there is nothing else to recommend. Not enough tension within the plot so I didn't actually care about the characters.Looks good but not a great film.",0
"This is not a bad film per se, had it been about 30-40 minutes shorter I would not have been too offended. But I am genuinely perplexed as to how people can rave over it - #13 on all time list at time of writing!! There is virtually no character development, the plot is overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions. Frankly you don't need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet. By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsense rules - anything to get me out of that chair.Is this really the same man who gave us Memento??",0
"I purchased this movie on bluray because it was on #6 so I purchased it for 200 Kr which is approximately 38$. I guess I expected a very entertaining movie. but then I began to watch it I was disappointed it was just too slow. I couldn't watch more than halve an hour. Next day I tried to watch it again and made it trough another have hour. I had payed money for it so I wanted to see it. third time I made it through the movie.the theme about dreaming is interesting enough,but they try to long to explain what was going on. Imho it was kind of self explained.I felt nothing for the characters.the plot doesn't get interesting or I didn't get the plot.there is no humour in the movie, they take themselfes to seriously.",0
"You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like ""for dummies"", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so ""in your face"". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8.

"Alright folks, I saw the same movie you saw. My wife and I both went into this with great expectations. Visually, the movie was interesting. Beyond that, it was ho-hum for us. I felt myself fidgeting in the seat several times wondering when they were going to get to the point. The film was about 45 minutes too long. The concept is very interesting, but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery. I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather. This movie was so pumped up that I was hoping for something brilliant like The Matrix. I feel like I got something more similar to ""The Happening"".",0
"This movie is so predictable that it takes all of 10 minutes to figure it out. At that stage you know you're going to waste another 2 and a half hours watching the nonsense where people slip in and out of dreams in an attempt to fabricate a story where there was no story.The plot starts in the first few minutes and ends in the last few minutes, everything in between... well... is better left unwatched.If you haven't figured it out immediately, then chances are you won't by the time it's over, in which case you're also wasting 2 and a half hours of your time.The only thing I got from watching this horrible overrated bloated cinematic experiment was a wish to kill myself. Maybe I'm dreaming, too?",0
"easily one of the worst films ever made, that some critics fell for it, just shows how bad today's professional critics have become. no doubt all the 14 to 18 year old Nolan fan boys are going to attack all of us, that have seen through this psycho babble non sense. ultimately the worst thing about the film is that it was utterly boring, from start to finish. at no time to you feel anything for any characters, the dialogue is of such a juvenile nature he must have got a 14 year old to write it. the guy has no idea of what dreams are what takes place during them, i will not go into any philosophical or psychological discussion here as the film does not warrant them, giving there is no sense in anything that is said or done. like dark knight this will have its time in the sun and in a few years the very same people who raved about it will wonder why. as for the ending with the top still spinning telling the audience that anyway it was all still a dream, totally makes the whole exercise futile. shame that a once good film maker has gone right up his proverbial",0
"My high expectations of this movie based on its no. 3 position in the Top 250 lasted for about 2 seconds into the movie. What a disgrace! And so childish. And Tiring! How can it be that everyone likes this movie. It's absolutely overloaded with bizarre and completely arbitrary turns of plot that have to be explained for about 75% of the movie. No character! No excitement, I could not even tell who were the bad guys. And yet again a few seconds of Michael Caine to camouflage the complete cardboard appearance of the entire cast! What is the meaning of this movie? What is it about? Uhhh???? Its internal logic is utter bullshit. Its emotional significance is zero, empty, frightening.Can please somebody agree with me, I feel so sad.Kurosawa come alive!",0
"I cannot phrase it better, so I will quote Rex Reed who called Inception's storyline ""prattling drivel."" A friend claimed Inception is a ""thinking person's movie"", but a thinking person will realize that it is only masquerading as a thinking person's movie. At bottom, intellectually, ""there is no there there."" Add to this that someone clearly believed the film needed to be pumped up with overwrought drama to qualify it as a ""summer blockbuster."" I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did, the intrusiveness of the loud, schlocky music over the closing credits seemed to crystallize all the incipient negative feelings I had been having throughout the movie. I hope that this director will go back to doing smaller films that do not stretch his concepts beyond what they can support.",0
"Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who doesn't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism. I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather. And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh.",0
"""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-",0
"This movie is a disaster on many levels, but where it fails most miserably is at attempting to put dreams on screen. This movie is the most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book ""The Power of Movies"", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something. What he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. ""Inception"" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually empty films like this (and ""Dark Knight"") as good examples of what ruined the country. Wretched excess.",0
"Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! was that enough DUMS! for you to make you feel sure this is the greatest film of the 21st century, Christpher Nolan's multi-layered visionary masterpiece? No? Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Come ON! Surely that must be enough DUMS! for you to realise that you're witnessing a tour de force from a director at the pinnacle of his genius? It's a film of transcendent majesty! A mind blowing spectacle utterly thrilling to the senses and deeply fulfilling to the intellect! And if you're not convinced of this, I can do what Christopher Nolan does, and just keep going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! until you are! It's a trick that seems to have worked on most people as they wander out of the cinema like wide eyed happy zombies, eager to write their adoring review on IMDb and give praise to Christopher Nolan who has now basically attained to them the status of God, but it doesn't work on me. I don't know why, but for some reason the idea that this film is a mesmeric piece of shimmering cinematic brilliance hasn't been 'incepted' into my mind.Actually I do know why. It's because it isn't a mesmeric piece of shimmering cinematic brilliance it's two and a half hours of sheer unadulterated boredom. There's no character development. The drama is unengaging. The action sequences are bizarrely devoid of tension. It's uninvolving. The characters waffle on and I don't care what they're saying. The gunfight sequences are tedious. The enemy characters frequently fire bursts of rounds but never manage to hit anyone despite ample opportunities. How many times does Nolan think it's a great idea to show a character floating around in a hotel corridor while fighting 'projections'? And someone please tell him that he can't prove to the world he's made the best film ever by going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! over and over again. Except apparently he can.The basic idea has the potential to make the stunning film so many people think it is, but Nolan wastes the opportunity with a dull storyline. Getting a business man to split up his company? Is that the most exciting thing he could think of? Couldn't he get a president to decide to launch a nuclear attack or something? Did it have to be something so mundane? And he weighs down the film with an abundance of under developed material and fails to create any sense of danger in the fights.Why does everyone think this film is SO good? People don't seem to be able to tell the difference between a film that tries to be fantastic but fails, and a film that is fantastic.Good things? yes it's had a lot of money spent on it. There are some striking images. Ellen Page is super pretty...erm...",0
"Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan (writer, producer and director of this movie) is a very, very talented filmmaker. He will undoubtedly make that masterpiece for which he will be remembered. But that's just my point: he hasn't made it yet. The Dark Knight wasn't it and Inception certainly isn't it. Inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche. His vision has been put on film without someone ever saying: 'Chris, that's not going to work.' For that matter, Inception should have been Nolan's Heaven's Gate. But Inception will probably make Nolan a even bigger star. He better check his totem? I felt compelled to write a review when I found out this movie had a 9.2 rating and a 3rd place overall in the top 250. Let me say: that is ridiculous. To balance the scale, I have rated this movie (a ridiculous) 1. I agree with some posts on the message board of IMDb: complex does not mean intellectual or smart. And for that matter, I don't think this film is very complex. It just asks what most movies do: go with it.DiCaprio gives a pretty good performance (with leftovers from his role in Shutter Island) as Dobbs, a person who is able the penetrate someone's dream and see or steal his secrets. Recently Dobbs lost his wife and he has not seen his children in a long time. That is because the authorities think he has something to do with his wife's death. Watanabe gives Dobbs a chance to get his life back. He needs to plant an idea (inception) in the mind of a competitor. Like a seed, it will grow. And the inspiration for the idea will seem real.One of the problems for me with the movie was that the dreamworld felt pretty flat and boring to me. Unlike The Matrix (a inception for this movie), the inhabitants of the other world do not bend the rules of gravity. The laws of physics do apply. That's not a bad decision. But I agree with one reviewer: 'Nolan's dreamworld looks like a mediocre action film from the 90's.' The bad guys walk around like video game characters with an AI set on level Easy. I almost shouted in the theater when Eames went Rambo in the snow scene. I understand the decision. Look at The Cell to see how wrong you can go if you explore the subconscious on film. But still, for me his decision to keep the dreamworld neat and clean is a cop out. Dreams don't look like this. Hopes, fears and experiences mix with (the conception of) the real world and you get a pretty original result sometimes. None of this in Inception. Oh right, the architect is in control. How convenient? The whole dream within a dream concept was a little far-fetched for me. Have you ever had one? Probably not. So why, when you have a pretty basic dreamworld go with a concept this unreal? The real world does influence the dream the character's have. But they feel it and are conscious that it is the real world. That's a missed opportunity. A dream influenced by factor's unknown to the dreamer could have made it much more enjoyable for the audience.Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. Like Nolan's former projects The Prestige and The Dark Knight: I don't get all the hoopla. Yes, these movies (like Inception) are well made. They are original, have refreshing ideas, are technically good and have decent scripts. But they are not the best of the decade. And this one really is not a 9.2. I'd say a 5.5. Barely...",0
"Around 750, the renowned poet of the Tang dynasty, Li Po, is supposed to have asked, ""Last night I dreamed I was a butterfly. Today, am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?"" Marcus Aurelius, the late Roman emperor and philosopher, wrote, ""Life is a dream, a little more coherent than most."" Freud concluded that dreams were the fulfillment of unconscious wishes that had managed to sneak past the dozing censor. Aboriginal Australians believed in a real parallel universe called The Dream Time in which everything and everyone who ever existed, still existed, and anybody could enter this place during sleep.Modern psychology believes that dreams are nothing more than random cortical bombardment caused by a lot of activity in sub-cortical structures associated with the filing of memories, and the cortex goes into overdrive trying to make narrative sense of them. Sex dreams are pleasant enough except when the furry little animals show up, but statistics demonstrate that the majority of dreams are truly lousy, the kind we can easily live without. Don't you get tired of running in slow motion through a swamp while being chased by an ogre? Does all this sound like pointless rambling to you? Well, then you're not going to enjoy ""Inception"" because it meanders at lightning speed all over the place and lives by no rules that human beings have ever known.On the other hand, if you find these adventitious allusions in some way interesting, then you should see this dark and muddled movie. You get a bonus too, because in its style it closely resembles an action movie from the 1980s. Everything is happening all at once -- or maybe not all at once. Who cares? The point is that people get shot in the forehead and buildings comes toppling down for no reason and slow-motion explosions take place at irregular but short intervals.I'm getting pretty tired of seeing films that use some bewildering metaphysical scheme as an excuse to show off still more CGIs. I couldn't watch this thing through.",0
"I could explain the devices that drive the action, but that would take away the jobs of all the archetypes in the film who's job it is to endlessly spout exposition that will explain the nonsensical and unaffecting action you see on the screen.If you think one level of action clichés is enough to rot your brain to a sub-100 IQ level, imagine SEVERAL levels of action clichés, all explained for you in a ""hey this isn't very interesting but we've created a world and have to explain it so we can get back to the gunfights in a dreamworld"".I'd probably put this down as one of the most empty viewing experiences I've ever had in my 40 years of movie-going. I want my money and 120 minutes (I left early) back.",0
"I don't get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading ""Go home! Go home!"" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters. Christopher Nolan did terrific, terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this film is unworthy of its success.",0
"It has taken me 9 years to get round to watching this and during that time I looked forward more and more to seeing it.
Was it worth the wait....NO.I find it difficult to find anything positive to say, but the premise and idea of the film is interesting.
That sadly is all, its an overblown mess of a movie with no place for a connection to the films characters.
A collection of choreographed fight scenes connected by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompanied by a bombastic score does not make an interesting movie.
Mr Nolan should have spent his time focusing on a coherent story and some character development, less time on trying to shoehorn in pointless action.A bitter dissapointment of a movie.",0
"Alright, so here's the thing; yes, it was cool that there was all that complexity. Yes, it was cool that there were so many layers of thought both on screen and off to what was going on. Yes, it was cool that Chris Nolan managed to make something unique and fairly independent in just one movie that was complex enough to account for a whole trilogy of movies in almost any other genre. But here's the thing; it had some rather alarming logical leaps that I could not get over.1.The Projections; Okay, so the things that inhabit the streets of the person's subconscious are manifestations of the various components of their brain as evidenced by the fact that when the characters need to find something out about the dreamer's perception of someone else they just follow that manifestation in the dream. Makes sense, because that thought does what the dreamer thinks it would do, not what the real person would do. When I saw that I went 'wow, that makes sense! Clever!', but then towards the end of the movie they say 'nevermind, they're just projections; they don't actually mean anything, and parts of their minds aren't being killed.' That was a little too convenient for my liking.2.The Totems; WHY doesn't the top fall over in the dream world? WHY does it keep spinning perpetually? Everything else obeys the laws of basic physics, so why wouldn't that? That was probably the dumbest thing I've seen in a movie this year; there wasn't even an attempt made to explain it. I can honestly say this was just as bad as 'only a prime can kill a prime' in Trasformers 2.3. The Architect/Dreamer Relationship; Why can only the architect choose the world they enter? And why is the only person who 'projects' characters into this world the person that's 'the dreamer'? They are ALL dreaming, every single one of them, so they should ALL be both altering the world they're in and the characters in it. And why can't the projections do anything cooler than be normal guys with guns? If I detected intruders in my mind I'd summon a nuke or Godzilla or Optimus Prime to get them out, not boring henchman who probably wouldn't be able to get the job done anyways.4. The Script, and it's supposed 'surprises' I felt kind of talked down to when they honestly expected it to be a surprise when you discovered that Molly's death was as a result of Cobb's previous inception. If ANYONE made it through that movie without figuring that out they deserve to be jettisoned into the sun for their stupidity. I caught on the moment he mentioned that inception was possible.5. Waking Up/Dying in the Dream When you die in the dream world you come back up a level towards consciousness, as evidenced by the fact that they wake up when they get shot in the face in the first scene. But wait! When they die in the dream you actually go down to limbo as evidenced by that happening to the oriental guy, which sucks because that's where it's just 'pure subconscious' and you wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually aren't in an endless limbo because Cobb and Molly went there once, but you still wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually don't wake up a vegetable because Cobb and Molly didn't when they killed themselves on the train tracks. But limbo is still bad.......right? Because you can't get out without becoming mentally handicapped, but if you can kill yourself to get out at any time just like a normal dream then why is limbo even bad? And isn't inertia supposed to wake you up? Technically the van falling off the bridge should have woken them up, or even it rolling, not it hitting the water. If the force of hitting the water is what woke them up, then shouldn't anything like a slap to the face do it? In the end the movie suffered from the EXACT same things The Dark Knight did, and that is Chris Nolan's conflicting desires to make something believable and for sensationalism, and both cancelling out the other. If you wanted to compare it to the other obvious similar franchise,The Matrix actually is believable. Oh, yeah, now that I think of the matrix, how does a tiny needle plugged into their wrist plug them into an alternate reality in Inception? The base of the skull made sense, this is just silly. People keep saying this is the next Matrix, but the difference here is that literally twenty views later everything in the Matrix STILL makes sense, and I punched holes in this latest Leonardo Decrapio movie in one sitting. Pathetic.",0
"I am astonished by the reviews posted. My only explanation is that this deadly dull movie put everyone else to sleep and they thought they saw a better movie. The performances were very lackluster and the actors all (except for Tom Hardy) looked like they were performing in their sleep.There was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in this plan from a personal motivation reason, and their behaviours were completely arbitrary. Did they get paid for their time or was there some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main character? I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or his motivation. There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would expect in a dream. The action sequences were dull and seemed to be just shooting people because there was a perceived need to have some gun fire. I struggled to stay in the theatre and see it through let alone stay awake.",0
"I shook my head in disbelief and disappointment while groaning thru the last 30 minutes ?.should have walked out on it?70% of the movie is spent with the characters trying to explain, and then re-explain the ""overly far-fetched"" parameters and boundaries of the plot TO EACH OTHER! - I am pretty sure the actors couldn't keep pace with what was happening. I bet there are equally like-minded scripts circulating at this very moment thru mental hospitals across the country.The makers of this film expect you to buy into an awful lot (and that's just within the first 3 minutes) - leading you around and around not knowing if you can even believe anything that happened only moments before? and then, you get the nice overly used ""OR IS IT??????"" totally smarmy and puzzling ending!!! (I saw that turd coming a mile away too)I guarantee you this? an evening rental of the movie and you will not be able to stay awake? far too many changes in direction, each one more annoying than the previous and yet still somewhat predictable.I'll sum it up like this and see if you are still interested?..""It's a dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream (that's right? 4 annoying levels sleep) and possibly?. Within yet another dream when it finally ends. COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL????.N O T ! ! ! ! ! ! !I say, ""If you must go? bring something to throw at the screen? NO STARS?.EVER.

"luckily I didn't see this thing until it hit television. I was actually glad that there were commercial breaks to pull me back from the edge of this nightmare of a movie. just as the actors did,i kept stretching out on the sofa to endure more of what ever this was, is or should be. surely, my mind was entered to force to me to stay with this movie, and don't call me Shirley. I even went to bed and took a 25 minute nap ( no lie). all these actors laying down to enter dream mode got me. at any rate, after the nap, I returned and quickly realized I missed nothing really. a waste of time, money ( if you paid to see it ). I wonder if the actors realized how bad this was at filming time, do they see it as the nightmare it is now?",0

It has you questioning reality all the way through; in some ways similar to The Matrix, I suppose, although it's more obvious in this movie that there's questioning about reality to be done. This movie, however, lacks the philosophical/religious elements that The Matrix had, and stands as a pretty formulaic action type movie with the issues about reality thrown in.Essentially, this movie takes place within a dream - or within dreams to be more precise. That's the catch. Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb plays a man who has somehow figured out not only how to get into people's dreams but how to link various people into the same dream, so that the dream becomes reality. Some tragedy has befallen Cobb as a result of this, which is finally revealed, but it does take a while. Cobb and his team are hired by a Japanese businessman who wants them to get inside the dreams of one of his corporate rivals to convince him to break his company up, thus eliminating the rivalry. The move goes from there.It's a confusing movie. There aren't just two layers to it - reality and dream. There are actually multiple layers of various kinds of reality, as characters can enter into dreams within dreams, each successive layer becoming more and more removed from what reality really is - if you get the point. It's imaginative, but it is confusing as you try to sort the layers out. In all honesty, it's not a movie that especially appealed to me. DiCaprio's performance was good but nothing more and there were some really good special effects included in this. Aside from the dream inside a dream inside a dream gimmick, though, this stacks up as an action movie among action movies, and I didn't find it an especially noteworthy addition to the genre. A friend told me it's the sort of movie you have to watch 2 or 3 times to really get your head around it. I think I have a reasonable enough attention span, and if I can't get my head around a movie on the first watching, then it's unlikely I'm going to go back to it again. I will say that this is the sort of movie that's tailor made to produce sequels. The very last scene leaves everything wide open to continue exploring whether or not Cobb is actually back in reality. (Remember, the top was still spinning on the table as the last scene faded out.) The possibilities for sequels are virtually limitless. Everything is based on a dream or dreams. You could have anything from comedy to action to historical epic to outer space adventure and it would all make sense, because it's all a dream or dreams! Still, while I can have some appreciation for the ingenuity of the writers to come up with a story that has the potential to literally go on forever, I didn't find enough here to make me want to look at the inevitable sequels.",0
"Look I am a fan of Chris Nolan or at least I used to be. His movies are always different and I liked them. Prestige was the first movie that I watched of him and I loved it. The Dark Knight was the movie that I had the highest expectations and it did not let me down. I know there are 10 things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were 1000 things to like. But this time I AM disappointed. Inception is like the cutest car that can't run very fast. It has its good looking but no good plot and a million questions about the concept.There are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story. When you watch one there are things you feel right or not. You can use your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense. This film certainly did not feel right. This was like a low budget science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for this was a big budget movie! Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie. It has a good concept, good graphics and good acting. If the plat was better and a few more things made more sense this could have been the masterpiece everyone thinks it to be.",0
"This is a tedious and boring movie that begs you to NOT suspend your disbelief and, instead, to wad up your popcorn bag and throw it at the screen. Okay, I exaggerate a little. But... Read the insightful reviews dated 19 July: You Don't Get It. And 20 July: Boring, Too Long, Awful Dialogue. And 21 July: Not Bad But Definitely Not Genius. And 29 July: Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. And finally, for a little fun, 23 July: Blah. Rather than rehash the insights of those helpful reviews, I'll try to add something useful...Inside of 30 minutes I was squirming in my seat, tapping my fingers, and checking my watch. Why? No character development. No sense that a good story had been started. And thus no engagement. As time wore on I found I really didn't care about any of the characters, or their plights, or what they were trying to accomplish, other than thinking Ellen Page was kind of cute.In an EW interview, Nolan says about his film, Memento, that he was ""trying to transcend the tyranny of linear narrative."" Really? A tyranny? We live in a linear narrative, Chris, but now that I know you feel that way about life, I'll remember not to pay to see your films. In the same interview, Nolan says that he was worried that his audience wouldn't be able to follow his brain-bending movie because of the complex dream-within-a-dream plot... until he lit upon (drum roll) the ""heist-flick model,"" in which the hero-thieves explain their scheme. Yes, Chris, but that's not a very good model. And what's more, it only works if the ""explaining is minimal"" and the director is skilled enough to show and reveal more. It's a moving picture, remember? Yes, the action here is pretty cool, better than the Dark Knight. The camera and stunt work are very good. The music is the same gloomy heavy-handed kind used in Dark Knight (same composer, Hans Zimmer). But the characters are essentially two-dimensional because everything is secondary to the plot, which in spite of its complexity you can understand well enough because it's all explained to you, endlessly. Even Dicaprio wasn't happy with his character and worked with Nolan for two months ""adding layers"" for more emotional depth (see the Rolling Stone interview). But apparently the complexity and ridiculousness of the plot buried that, or Nolan just didn't know how to deliver it (come to think of it, this may be a problem with all of his films). Plot over character. Cool factor over emotion. You think of the great work DiCaprio did in The Aviator. And the brilliant work by Gordon-Levitt in The 500 Days of Summer. I wasn't much of a fan of Juno, but Ellen Page ""made"" that movie. And of course Michael Caine has made many great movies, including the recent Harry Brown. Also, Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai. And finally, let's not forget Marion Cotillard's stunning Oscar-winning performance in La Vie En Rose. But they're all struggling mightily here with Nolan's tedious script, and their immense talent is wasted.But of course, I'm all wrong. The movie is a huge hit. It's sure to rack up $500 million or more in worldwide box office sales. Whew! That's good news. Because then Nolan can go on ""transcending the tyranny.""",0
"I would have honestly given the movie a 7 but the current rating is very undeserving and I had no choice but to make the least contribution I could make to it. The writer/director of Inception thought if maybe they pretended to have a very complex plot and great special effects, the audience would not realize how pointless the whole story is. The audience were like; ""OH! Such a complex plot! A Genius!! A Masterpiece!!"" The first hour and a half all they do is explain the whole inception system without moving the plot forward. I am sure most of the audience didn't get what the movie was about but they pretended so they would not look stupid. And Christopher Nolan is going;""I don't really think of films in terms of light and dark...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah! ...thriller that takes place in the mind...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah!"" The intention of the film clearly reflected on itself. The point was not to entertain audience but rather it was a show-off of what artistic capability the director/writer possesses. It tried to point out the fact what a movie genius Christopher Nolan is. I mean I love this guy. The Prestige was great and so was the Dark Knight. But Inception was really showing off. Look at Kick-Ass, Watchmen and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. They were complete honest movies. Their intentions were clean and they reflected in the movie. They were meant for pure entertainment and that's what we got. On the other hand Inception was trying too hard. I could really point the fact on how the intentions of the movie was showing off but I would rather suggest the audience to watch the movie once again. They said the movie was very unpredictable. Suppose there is a man chopping onions in the movie and suddenly the chopped onions turned into a chicken. Now would that be predictable? They might say Cobb's wife living with him till old age in the dream was unpredictable. Are you serious!! How come you haven't seen that one coming!! It was so obvious! It is only the fact the way it was dramatized that made it seem unpredictable and shocking. Top 10 in the IMDb chart!!! Are you kidding me!!",0
"If you like action movies and are short of gray matter, you'll love this one. But if you have a brain, or even half of one, you'll want your money back.This dreadful piece of trash is the biggest wast of money, both mine and the producers', that I believe I've ever seen. Intellectually incoherent, VERY bad acting, mediocre special effects. needlessly convoluted plot and worst of all, completely pointless. All the actors are talented (except Marion Cotillard, who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, in English anyway), but they were all just phoning it in.All the positive reviews, of which there are_unfortunately_many, never mention how great the ""Story""or ""plot"" is. The mental midgets who like it rave and rave and rave about the special effects. Well, my dear thinking, tasteful friends, that should tell you something. Do not go see this movie unless you are escaping open-air radiation.",0
"We went to see this movie at an IMAX theater. After reading the initial reviews about the special effects and the cinematography, and seeing all of the trailers and special shorts on the film, this seemed like a sound choice. What an absolute waste of money! After reading the other user reviews, I can't help but wonder if we didn't watch a completely different film. All science fiction films require a suspense of reality as they are based on a future time, feature incredible technology which is currently beyond our reach, etc. Given that, most films try to put this aspect into some kind of context which makes the central premise believable or possible. Not in this case. This film's plot vehicle is something called is 'shared dreaming,' through which a third-party can access your dreams and unlock information you are keeping secret. It is somehow done by connecting the dreamers up to a devices contained in stylish briefcases and then - POW - they are in an apparent instant REM state, all connected together and journeying off in their dream world. Huh? It's just thrown out there and the audience is expected to just absorb the concept, accept it and move on to be wowed by all the special effects. A murmur of 'I don't get it' was heard throughout the theater I was in.Early in the film Dicaprio approaches a student played by Ellen Page, who is a student of his old professor and asks her to be an 'architect' and design his dream environments for him. The environments must have mazes and paradoxes. Now, most folks when presented with such a concept would be calling the nut house on a guy like Dicaprio, but Page's character just accepts the whole thing and dives in, having a whee of a time with the environment she creates, bending it and reforming it in visually impressive ways. There is no attempt, however, to sell this whole thing to the audience and it just doesn't work in any sort of context. As the team descends through layers of 'levels' of dreams, the whole thing just becomes more moronic and boring. Great visuals, lots of action, but it all just seems pointless.I would put this down as one of the worst movies I've ever seem. Beautifully shot, but with an empty, stupid plot.",0
"Perusing the top 250, I was shocked to see this in the list, never mind so near to the top. I make no apology for admitting, that I fell asleep on numerous occasions (though kept re-winding). This is something I haven't done since Transformers (no re-winding),despite the thundering 5.1 soundtracks. Both these movies are style with no substance, but, back to this one.Has the need to appear intelligent by ""loving"" this film, so resulted in an ""Emporer's new clothes"" atmosphere? Can the slip-shod writing and drum-roll, sign-posted direction be so easily forgiven, in lieu of it's unique premise? (nobody mention The Matrix!)I hope this tumbles off the list as time passes, because it devalues some great picks and under-ground, high-points, that have already made it, thanks to some more discerning movie-goers.",0
"Terrible film. There are way better iterations of dream films than this. Mulholland Dr. by David Lynch is one of them.Like some others have posted around the web, it was too long, and too confusing. Not that there was any depth or cleverness to the film. Too much repetition. They kept 'trying' to explain everything over and over again. It was just a stream of Hollywood trash. Didn't really seem like any of the subjects were dreaming at all. Just explosions and dumb dialogue, with shallow characters and a convoluted storyline.SPOILER ALERT...The film is a film about a man, Leonardo... an Architect, who falls asleep on a plane in first class. It's a long flight to LA, so the movie shows what he is dreaming about during that time that he is asleep on that flight. The only real part of the film is when he wakes up at the end in the plane. He looks around, sees a cabin full of people in first class, then gets off the plane, and goes home with Michael Caine, either his father, grandfather, or caretaker for his two children.The people in first class were in his dream because he saw them in the cabin before he fell asleep. They then each took on a part in his dreaming, but none of them have any connection to his real life. And no, he is not a thief. He is not hired by some black corporation to extract information from people through dreaming. There is nothing of the sort. The movie is just a dream.Supporting evidence:1. First, the movie is just shallow trash. Horrible illustration of a dream film just down to its core. It's so bad that it is obvious how hard they tried to make it look like a dream.2. Reference to Architects... a dream architect is simply what Leonardo is in real life: an Architect.3. Projection... they must have said projection 100 times. It's obvious that the movie is telling you that Leonardo is just projecting his own subconscious onto the others in his dream. This is the only part of the movie that is decent academically. The fact that the filmmakers understand what psychological projection is. But also, the fact that they repeated the concept of projection so many times it just lost its value. Anyway, Leonardo projects his wants, fears, and desires, in a convoluted way, onto the other subjects. For example, ""Fischer"" takes on his own self in relation to his father. Also, the girl who keeps telling him to move on is another projection of his own mind telling himself to move on from his wife's death...The movie progresses and gets ever more deeper into Leonardo's subconscious, where the root of his anxiety resides. He finally discovers that it is OK for him to be his own man, to be an Architect, and not try to live up to what his father was. So we have a set of problem(s) that reveal themselves ever so slightly as the dream progresses, in the form of Leonardo projecting his fears, etc. onto other subjects, until he goes so deep as to arrive at a place where he has a feeling it is really about him. Like a sort of solution. But like anything, the problems need to be apparent before a solution can be revealed. Dreaming is like this. Your mind weaves together a series of experiences, and projections, and if you understand them enough, you'll know what the problems really are, and you can then begin working on a solution in real life...He then wakes up. Reality is there. It was a cathartic release.4. The dream sharing... there is no literal dream sharing, getting into the minds of others and extracting their thoughts. This is a metaphor... the movie is telling us that there are a group of people in a small area (cabin of a plane) who are all dreaming... and they may have a bit of a spiritual connection to each other... so one person feeling anxious, another may 'feel' this while dreaming and some sort of shared experience results. It's a bit of a play on the idea that people can dream together and sort of experience similar or even the same things. But that's pseudo-science and mostly fiction.5. Recurring nightmare about his wife. Obviously this is another clear marker that it is just a dream. His recurring nightmare about his wife. Looks like she killed herself, perhaps jumped out of a hotel room window because Leonardo didn't show up for their anniversary. Perhaps he was not a good husband and wasn't around enough... he then blamed himself. The girl in the film kept telling him to move on... So Leonardo's major life issues were revealed in a convoluted way within a long dream. Like any human being, those issues are complex. The ending showed how he seemed relieved when he got home to see his kids. It looks like it was a very important dream because it pushed him over a threshold and helped him to realize a set of things to make his life better.Also, can we please stop with all the discussion about the tenability of the things seen in the film? Most of it won't make much sense: it was just a dream. Therefore, defying gravity, ending up in different stages of life so quickly, etc.... it all makes sense when understood from the perspective that: it. was. just. a. dream. Now, after such a lengthy review and explanation, you might be wondering why I only gave it 1 star. I'll end how I started: it's Hollywood trash. Too basic. Too stupid. Too obvious. And to someone how dreams every night, and the fact that there are way better films about dreaming out there, there is nothing to see here...",0
"I was on the verge of leaving the Cinema on this completely ridiculously story. I hung in there (also despite the insanely annoying music) though, and am simply shocked that the film has (currently) a top 3 position of movies ever made. Perhaps I have entered a (bad) dream and have not yet woken up...So the backdrop of the story is basically that a bunch of guys drug people and enter a dream world using a plastic box with wires attached to those entering the dream. In this dream they use the same technique (the box and drugs are now just apart of THIS dream..) to enter another dream. This process can be repeated a number of times - and in the movie they go to the fourth dream-layer. If you are killed while dreaming you will wake up - unless you are too heavily sedated (in real-life, or also in one of the dreams?..), which will then put you in a ""limbo"" state - which can potentially last for years. If you want to get out of a dream safely - you need to be ""kicked"" (sharp acceleration) in the dream-layer above the one you are currently in. If you are unsure if you are dreaming or not, you have a ""totem"" (a physical object that for some unspecified reason behaves differently in a dream - why?) that you can examine.I just hate it. Simply hate it...The only good thing I see in this movie is the ending: DiCaprio sees his kids again - but they look exactly as they have done in his dreams - they have not aged at all. This means that he is still dreaming and he is therefore stuck in a new limbo dream world - and will be there for a LONG time. Phew... that means there won't be a sequel until he wakes up again. Unless it is me that's still dreaming.",0
"At one point Cobb tells us that despite his best efforts, he cannot create a dream wife with the depth and complexity of his real wife. Could this be Nolan's own subconscious, commenting on his own limitations as a writer and director?Cobb undertakes to plant an idea in someone's head so that Cobb's employer can monopolize an industry. Cobb succeeds, and thereby recovers his own life. No one in the film questions the morality of this; the film doesn't really question the morality of this, or invite the viewer to do so. Apparently, it's just business. Although in a way that is often thin, banal, or hypocritical, usually the sentiments offered to us in movies managed to stay aligned with basic ideas of good and evil. Not in the case of Inception. The popularity of this movie is a little frightening.",0
"Inception no more explores dreams and the human mind than Star Wars explores outer space. Inception is a rip-off of the novel Fireflies in the Shadow of the Sun (FSS), published in 2004 but preceded by a web site on dreams (2001-2009), the thrust of which is about how dream experiences are the source of ideas and other changes to waking life, including personality development. The broader point is that like his character Dom Cobb, Nolan himself steals the ideas he needs to create Inception from a novelist and life long dream researcher.Chapter 7 titled ""Journey by Deflection"" occurs entirely in a shared dream in which 2 protagonists ascend / descend through ""levels of dreaming"" in action-oriented sequences and even a ""dream within a dream,"" addressing how intermittent awareness of the dreams affects the dream. But Inception does not (a) intrigue / illuminate as to how these levels are distinct and yet intrinsically related or (b) draw from real dreams and real similarities to waking life. Inception is just an action film set in dream space that neglects the essence of dreaming in dream symbolism. The dream space featured in Inception is fictitious -- a contrivance of both Nolan and of the architect in Nolan's story. Inception would have benefited by emulating FSS in the one way it did not emulate it. In FSS the characters trapped in the shared dream have to solve the dream's logic in order to wake up. This plot is much more conducive to an education of the language of dreams, which FSS author spent an entire lifetime understanding from the time he started a diary of his own dreams at age 13 to his doctoral dissertation at age 27 exploring the relationship between dream experiences, coping strategies, blood chemistry, and symptoms in terminally ill cancer patients. Like FSS however, and this is yet another coincidental similarity between the two works, in Inception the characters are thwarted by a dream that is plugged into their mental efforts to understand it. Also as in FSS, the dreamers have to deal with the denizens of a dream world that react to periodic episodes of lucid awareness of the dream. In FSS, the whole script, including objects and aspects of the environment, respond to the awareness, but in Inception we get the juvenile and scientifically ignorant development that other characters in the dream respond to Dom Cobb and his team like white blood cells to foreign pathogens. The bottom line is that FSS teaches us things about dreams and Inception will impress only the most psychologically unsophisticated among us or those who have never remembered a dream in their life.Also like FSS, Inception makes the point that much of the bizarreness of dreams is attributable to a higher-order thinking. It does this using a statement very similar to one from the former FSS web site, which maintained that while dreaming is a whole brain activity, the conscious person uses only about 3-5% of his or her brain. FSS author remarks that experiencing and trying to make sense of a dream is like trying to fit 100% of something into 3-5% of itself -- there will be distortion!The subject matter notwithstanding, Nolan's storytelling and direction are designed to give artificial weight to the real value of plot twists. In Nolan we have a director who conceals and compensates for second-rate thinking with CGI and high-octane action that detracts from the story without getting the blood flowing. The action in the film was supposed to create a sense of time-sensitive suspense, but came across more like the dull dishwater backing up in my sink than a raging river.There are also inconsistencies in the film. Nolan wants us to invest in the idea that everything that happens in a dream has an effect on the waking life of the dreamer. It works -- until Dom Cobb dismisses out of hand his shooting of all these dream characters like they were throngs of disposable orcs or storm troopers, claiming its OK because they are ""merely projections of the subconscious."" Suddenly, what happens in dream Vegas stays in dream Vegas. And where did the idea of ""limbo"" come from -- introduced as a patchwork device for a poorly articulated plot.And much of the film's premise is contradicted by real research which shows that the relationship between perceived and actual dream time is roughly 1:1.",0
"It is unbelievable that this film has received such accolades by reviewers. It is as if the film itself is trying to practise in real life its own concept: planting in the viewer's mind from the inception that it has extraordinary merit. This must be the ultimate film business gambit and possibly the most daring ever tried in film promotion history. Surrounded by mind-numbing images and eleven-dimensional sound you are told a hundred times every minute what a great film you are viewing. Just look at the audience when you go to see it (as I am sure you will): they looked bored and perplexed but have arranged their faces in expressions of seeming appreciation in fear of being thought of as square, to use and old beatnik term. This would be the dullest film I have ever seen, almost anyway, and everyone I spoke to - even strangers - after the showing said that from its INCEPTION they could hardly wait for it to finish. Money has scaled new heights of desperation to be made. Shame on all the actors who contributed to this disgraceful exercise in megalomaniacal money-making!",0
"Nolan has made some of the dreariest films in recent memory, but this incomprehensible nonsense takes the cake. While keeping a straight face, actors deliver lines such as ""dreams within dreams is too unstable"" and ""if we get killed we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn into scrambled egg."" DiCaprio and company supply the ham. This movie tells us that ten hours of real time is equivalent to one week of dream time. That explains why this nightmare of a movie feels like it goes on for two days despite the running time of two and a half hours. And if one falls asleep while watching, the only way to resume one's normal life is to limbo under a totem pole.",0
"No, not intellectually: there's tons of thought (or at least editing) going on in this film. But there's no characterization, there's no heart (Leo's one anguished cry of ""Jesus, noooo!"" isn't ""heart,"" it's badly directed overacting), and, worst of all, there's no morality.I'm an ill-tempered, outspoken, foul-mouthed termagant (that by way of explanation for those about to call me a right-winger, a teabagger, or a prude), but when I watched this thing I was dumbstruck not on an intellectual level (oh, golly gee, we're dream-diving! Like in ""The Matrix,"" only inside brains instead of a mainframe! Wow. Uh, sure.) but on a moral one. See, the film has NO PROTAGONIST. It has criminals, it has those who facilitate those criminals' activities, and it has a victim. That's all.And, yes, I had-- and have-- a real (or is that ""real""-- see, I'm of the camp that thinks the whole sorry mess took place in Cobb's bigger mess of a head) problem with that.Almost no one (I would have opted for a plain, sweeping ""No one,"" no ""almost,"" but I recall one review among dozens and dozens that hit on what I'm about to say) seems to see anything wrong with the idea that Cobb and his crew are (ostensibly-- pretermitting for the time being the perpetual argument regarding whether the whole sorry scenario is or isn't a dream) performing an act of mental violation on an innocent man. Why is this? The action isn't that impressive (even the infamous hotel-corridor sequence)-- yes, Nolan does ""loud"" and ""in your face"" very well, but the Bond films have been doing more breathtaking and cleanly shot action work for four decades now. (I actually laughed out loud when Cobb and Arthur, decked out in pimp-fashion leather coats and stocking masks, shouted threats at kidnapped Robert Fischer in a dream-warehouse-- not, of course, to be confused with a warehouse of dreams (that might invoke imagination): what, you couldn't just have your goons strong-arm a kidnappee in the ""real"" world, Nolan? This is as creative as you can get?) We can't just proffer ""Cobb must see his kids again at any cost!"" as an excuse-- or can we? (I would certainly hope not.) Is it because Fischer is a Caucasian businessman, and therefore intrinsically deserving of attack in this economically volatile era? (The argument that Fischer's business rival Saito is somehow bravely trying to prevent Fischer from forming a monopoly is weak at best: that's what anti-monopoly laws are for, and, by agreeing to attack Fischer on Saito's behalf, Cobb is merely enabling Saito to form a monopoly of his own. And, seriously, inception and/or extraction would be ridiculously iffy forms of espionage. Break into the safe inside my skull, Cobb my boy, and enjoy the five hundred verses of ""I'm 'Enry the Eighth, I Am"" I've got planted there.) Or is it, possibly worst of all, because Cobb and his goons ""kindly"" leave Fischer with happy thoughts of his coldhearted father? (From monopolies to psychiatry, then: if Robert Fischer has daddy issues, that's what analysts are for. Cobb and his stampeding creeps are in Fischer's mind to commit a crime; any ""resolution"" they provide him is a byproduct of that crime, and resoundingly, cruelly false.)We might argue that Cobb and his crew are anti-heroes, but they're not. ""The Dirty Dozen"" are anti-heroes, criminals and psychopaths nonetheless working for the forces of good by fighting an evil greater than themselves (that evil being the nasty Nazis); Dom Cobb is nothing more than a thief (and, despite the ad copy, not a very good one) perpetrating an insidious act of mental rape against an innocent man (and, by extension, all those who rely on that innocent man's business for their livelihoods). Why all the sympathy for this thug and his crew? What's the catch? When children are involved, or when guilt (real or imagined) is in the mix, are we just supposed to chuck morality out the window...? (The last sad thing, I guess: No one on the team, not even newbie Ariadne-- and, granted, she's likely either a figment of Cobb's imagination, like the story as a whole, or a plant-- questions the ""right"" of what they're doing. Not only does this make me deeply uncomfortable, it's incredibly shallow writing. An opportunity for character development, tossed. But that's classic Nolan, isn't it? If he can't cover it with an iconic grunt-- ""She was lovely,"" Arthur deadpans to Ariadne, when Ariadne asks what nasty dream-shade Mal was like when she was alive (heck, Arthur, she's still, technically, ""lovely""; we were looking for maybe just a touch of explanation here regarding her relationship with Cobb and the team, big boy)-- it doesn't get covered.) Or, in the end, are we just supposed to excuse the immorality of the situation by saying, ""Ha! It's all a dream anyway!""? Very much bothered by this, especially since this behemoth has gulped down some one billion dollars in box-office take worldwide....... and that's why I'm giving it two stars. Cillian Murphy looks very nice in his natty suits, and he cries very prettily before Nolan realizes that-- horrors!-- someone is emoting on screen, and jerk-cuts away. Marion Cotillard does her best to squeeze dimensionality from yet another one-d Nolan-woman part; as Mal, she's a sad, psychotic, lovely mess. One star for each of them. As for the rest of it: what a pathetic reflection on values, and what a lousy story. Excellent snow-job, Mr. Nolan, but no star for you.",0
"This is ,unfortunately, a cinematic catastrophe, and all my expectations that I might have had before like this being the most original film of the year that might open a new page in the sci-fi genre, proved completely and utterly misconceived, to say the least. This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan's Dark Knight, supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism, originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all, this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned 'within loops', as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a pleasant, 'wellness ' relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear, Nolan is here! But, the damn time, it just won't follow the film's logic, 140 minutes is a heck of a time to kill the boiling fury over this total waste of money, time and personal dignity. Thank God for Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien series and a million other films. Crisis in the screenplay department has really surpassed the worst personal expectations, now even the illiterate are writing ? Just horrible",0
"Cobb is a extractor, he enters the minds of powerful people and takes their ideas. Only his latest case is not as simple, instead of taking an idea, he must implant one; however Cobb is a man whose own sub-conscience is in disarray as his dead wife threatens to destroy him.I thought originally when I watched the trailer...""Interesting...But I've seen this somewhere before?""And then as I watched the film it hit me..'Paprika!', Paprika is a anime were a therapist enters the minds of patients to distinguish the problem.I am not saying that the film is a complete copy, because its not...However, the complexity of the film is quite confusing at times, even for a life long sci-fi fan; I guess that was the allure when you consider the many, many positive and glowing reviews. I enjoyed some of the action sequences, but it did not really keep me on the edge of my seat. Cillian Murphy and Ken Wattanbe, were the true stars in my opinion, they played their roles very well, while Leonardo DiCaprio was one dimensional, even though he was supposed to be the most complex and intriguing character in the film.",0
"The special effects were great but the science was so flawed in this movie that it was incredible. The storyline made absolutely no sense at all. It also appears to be a bad ripoff of the Matrix (can you say the Architect). Even more illogical is the fact that if the ""Architect"" can create stairs, doors, or even an entire dream environment at will, why can't they fly, destroy anything they want any way they want, or make themselves invisible. At least in the Matrix Neo could fly.The movie just contradicts all of its own rules. People were falling all over the place throughout different dream states but no one woke up, even though a sense of falling wakes you up. Even worse was the supposed technology used to put everyone in the same dream. I don't even want to get started with that one but a pair of ear-buds just will not do it. I really think we need to stress science a little more in our schools.It was pretty cool looking though.",0
"For a film that deals in the world of dreams this film lacks a lot of imagination. I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental amounts of money that are thrown at it.The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps Kafka's 'The Trial' or a more Cronenberg style would have helped.After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more Mission Impossible. I couldn't help thinking of the could have beens. All I remember is a van falling for two hours, some irrelevant action scenes in the tundra, and an in-durable no gravity scene which had me yawning.Oh and am I the only one who cannot stand Marion Coutillard?",0
"A competent movie that somehow has gotten a ridiculous amount of praise. I felt just about everything in this movie was average, but I am sick of being berated for refusing to say this movie is anything less than perfect. A decent premise, well acted, but long and slow. Unfortunately this movie is riddled with mistakes and the subplot with the wife could have been so much more interesting than her barely getting a look in. Some good moments, but not enough to make it as long as it was for me.Also, was it just me, or were the kids the same age at the end of film? If so then doesn't this mean that the is he in a dream or not ending (which I saw coming as soon as they introduced the spinning top by the way) is pointless as if the kids haven't aged, it must be a dream.Don't believe the hype!",0
"Well, it's of course not 1 out of 10, more like 4, but in the light of current rating 9 out of 10 and climbing I'd give it a negative number. Please, please, please ignore its IMDb rating - it's becoming more and more meaningless. The idea for the plot is actually pretty interesting and some scenes are original but that's pretty much it. Each and every character is one-dimensional and shallow, the political setting is such a cliché and ending is easily predictable. There is a lot of stupid and unneeded chasing and shooting, punching and kicking, very much like in cheap Chinese movies. Which is fine in itself if all that you expect is an action movie, but if you expect something more memorable, then just skip it in theatres and rent a DVD in a few months. While watching such movies there is feeling that it's made like a puzzle from predefined pieces. Each piece was seen million of times before and the whole does not add anything on its own. I wholeheartedly agree that shooting a movie is not easy, and nobody can probably generate enough fresh ideas to produce a masterpiece each time. This time Nolan produced a mediocre result, let's wish him next time to make less primitive and more interesting show.",0
"Apart from being a boring and absolutely stupid movie, there are some other points that bother me. 1) Both this movie and TDK got up to the top 5 of IMDb without any evident reason, which makes me suspect there is a ring of ""paid"" contributors bringing the movie up. Once it is off the cinema, it will start dropping, as ""real"" people give the votes and not the dream-reviewers. 2) I actually believe in the perspective of the dead wife; the whole reality is ultimately a dream and a creation of our own consciousness. What bothers me is how my subconsciousness could create such a crappy and meaningless movie.",0
"This movie is just disappointing and dreadfully bad. People are victims of the marketing campaign: ""this movie is complex, intellectual and multi-layered and if you don't understand it then you are stupid"". People don't like to be stupid and having seen that it's written, produced and directed by the same guy who did The Dark Knight they don't think anymore and go to see Inception.So, I will show you that Mr. Nolans movie is the opposition of ""complex and intelligent"": SUPERFICIAL. I have at least 6 arguments:1. The characters are just silhouettes, transparent and shallow. There is no psychological deepness; the protagonists are emotionless objects moved from place to place like chess figures. They don't have any soul. But what marked a movie is his developing of characters. Sure, you try to create something deep with the relationship between DiCaprio and Cotillard but it's just pathetic, amateurish and stereotypic. And then the kids' back that we see so often that it gets on the viewer's nerves.2. The music by Hans Zimmer is a torture. It's so loud and indifferent that your head is ringing at the end. 3. The dramaturgy is completely neglected. One destruction-scene follows the next; one pursuit-scene follows the next! And the end! What a big disaster: it's like in a video game, in an ego-shooter. It's so stupid. Almost propaganda for war.4. Then, Nolan will make this movie ""intelligent and complex"". Do you know M. Nolan that intellectual and deep does not mean emotionless and a confusing plot? 5. Nolans idea to enter in the dream of somebody else is not so bad but the idea is not exhausted. Dreams are imagination, there are no rules, and they are bizarre and strange (Have you ever seen a film by David Lynch Mr. Nolan? That is like a dream.). So what all the guys with guns are doing there? Why are there always skyscrapers or a military base? That's stupid. There is NO IMAGINATION, your dreams are copies of real life and they are even WORSE than reality. The only good thing is the sequence with the train.6. To select a well actor like Michael Caine for saying two lines is just embarrassing and disrespectful. Mr. Nolan is capable of making great movies (Memento, The Prestige) but this one is very, very poor.Your movie is not ""complex, intelligent and deep"" but just superficial and an insult for the reasonably carefully viewer.",0
"It could possibly be Leonardo DiCaprio. That's a bit harsh _ I know he has to eat too _ but does he have to always play the same sanctimonious, pedantic, self-righteous know-it-all? And he's been in some bad movies recently. ""Revolutionary Road"" was a potentially good movie, but he always comes off as immature. ""Shutter Island"" was so transparent that I guessed the ending about 10 minutes in. But, this is supposed to be about ""Inception""...Yes, ""Inception"", a movie so simplistic that I yawned throughout. My (lucky) wife fell asleep claiming that it wasn't of interest to her. What claimed to be a smart, intelligent thriller, turned out to be the usual bag of guns, explosions, chases, etc. The plot, paper-thin and without any real point, is a yawn-fest of borrowed ideas and takes liberally from movies we've seen before. Is 10 years really soon enough to remake ""The Matrix"" (with Ellen Page as Neo)? Dennis Quaid in ""Dreamscape"" is far more entertaining. ""Videodrome"" is way more complex and intriguing, a movie that makes the viewer work.While the acting is fair enough for an action flick, there isn't much to say about the movie at all. It's pretty 1-dimensional and quite dumb. What really irks me is the fact that I was told repeatedly about how this movie was so complex, complicated, hard to understand, etc. It's really not. It just uses a nonsensical plot device; that of layered dreaming, to try and outwit the audience. While completely ridiculous _ isn't a dream within a dream just part of the same dream? _ it's also not hard to grasp. Is the bar really that low? What would the audience that this bamboozled make of a movie like ""Primer"" which is one of the most complex movies ever devised. Even ""Mission Impossible"" had more plot twists and turns than this drivel.To be honest it was barely just okay. It was boring like a bus-ride through Nebraska. Your mind is the scene of the crime? I didn't see much of any crime - just some folks trying to get a guy to change his mind. Big deal. Michael Caine is even becoming a Director's Trademark. His two minutes on-screen were gratuitous at best, certainly not a requirement to the story.So, to wrap up: boring, simple-minded, dumb, nonsensical plot with no 'science' and barely any 'fiction', less-than-average acting, annoying constant music while people are talking, convenient 'get-outs' when the logic of the story fails, which is frequently. Wow, I actually think I hate this movie.",0
"It is obvious people do enjoy psychological thrillers, virtual reality, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Inception, having it all, will astonish and marvel crowds of cinema goers into thinking they are smart and profound just for getting or liking the movie. I have to say, I admire the movie's performance into tricking its viewers like that; because that's what it is, a trick. A dream within a dream, and doesn't that sound attractive...It is the kind of movie that gets nominated for Oscar just for its crowd pleasing abilities, and Oscars are born within the capitalist world and needs all the capital it can get. Just like Avatar got nominated in the ""best movie"" category... I've read some review saying Inception could be the movie of the decade; obviously, the guy didn't see that many movies in the last ten years; there are better movies in 2010 only, and a bunch of them.I'm not saying the movie is bad; it's a good movie for its genre; what I didn't like about it is the fuss it created (and that fuss will disappear like it disappeared before for other crowd adored films), but mostly its lack of authenticity, therefore its PRETENTIOUSNESS.This is not a gem - it is a pile of dust in the eyes.",0
"I do not understand why this movie is so over rated. I seriously thought what in the world is this movie trying to say. Are they saying you can actually control actions in a dream and not only that, you can even collaborate with other people in that dream and better still dream again in a dream and then if you aren't satisfied then dream one more time. Now that's hilarious. They might have proved one thing they are saying which is planting an idea in minds. I think the movie plants and idea that you can dream on whatever you want and looks like they done a good job in that. People actually liked this movie. whao!",0
"Everyone knows no matter how absurd it is, a dream is as real as (sometimes more so than) reality. Instead of taking advantage of this (lack of creativity? too scared?), the film confines itself to mirroring reality in every way - be it time, space, surroundings, physicality, ideas, or behaviours. Under the incoherent, made-up-as-we-go logic, the film is but a low-grade action film in a sci-fi disguise. The story line is laughably childish, the music is over dramatic and there's zero character development. It's a shame to see Ellen Page and Michael Caine's talent abused in this dribble. It's such a pity, really. In the right hand the same material could flourish and treat us to mind-blowing wonders and imaginations. Christopher Nolan has missed the point completely: dreams can be absolutely anything. Anything! We want to see rules bent and physics defied. But instead we were given the action sequence and plot from a 70s B movie. Entertainment-wise it's not that bad a film (admittedly there are far worse action films around), probably 2.5 stars if you leave your brain outside the theatre. But given the current unjustified high rating, I have to give it a super low one to tip the balance.",0
"People who are reviewing this as the best movie they have ever seen seriously needs to wake up from their dreams. I don't know who planted this idea in their brain that this is directorial tour-de-force by Nolan but one thing is for sure, Ledger saved Nolan's glutes bigtime. His screen writing technique is feeble; creativity doesn't merely consist of just going berserk with visual treat and showing whatever comes in a ten second unchecked, brainstorming session rather creativity requires constraint. And this movie lacked any constraint whatsoever.If it wasn't for the ultracool visual effects and graphics this movie would be nothing but a vacuous thought bubbles of a person. Whereas Nolan's Dark Knight, instilled by Ledger's genius, was entirely character driven, this movie was entirely fueled by graphical eye-candies. A movie resonates over time when you want to watch certain scenes from it over and over and over again in youtube or your blu-ray disc rented from your local Chinese 99c video store. There were no witty dialogs or any memorable scene in the film that will compel me to stay transfixed in the screen and rewind it over and over and over again.Movies like Vanilla Sky had the same concept yet was made more artfully where the director didn't go overboard with visual scenes while having barely substantial plot.People need to seriously have a reality check. But if majority of the viewers are giving positive reviews, and if you are the only one going against the crowd that surely means there is something ""wrong"" in your system? Tsk, tsk, tsk what naysayers won't realize is that it would be more comforting to delude oneself and jump on the bandwagon saying it was great film, than admit that they got ""jipped"" $10.00 for some Sony Vegas type of wizardry. Hey it's the summer after all and it's not ""cool"" to say things which may otherwise offend your friends!",0
"Inception rated 12 of all films,above for instance of ALL OF HITCHCOCK'S FILMS.The problem and it isn't about rating movies only ,but let's say ,discussing who is the best footballer of all time ,or which is the best musician etc,IS that young people ,who are the majority of those who are familiar to the internet and go and write reviews ,haven't seen great people in their lifetime and can't comprehend what their real value was.It's different to listen from other people about Pele or Maradona than actually watch them ,when they were in their prime.It's different to listen from other people about the Beatles ,than actually understand what was going on, when they performed in the 60's.So OK,i won't be surprised if Justin Bieber on an online survey is higher than the Beatles ,because the teenagers are 70-90% of all internet users.So that leads to unbelievable PERVERSED results,like this above.In 10 years time the DVD version of this ""masterpiece"" might be selling 20-30 copies all over the world(not thousands).I think it's the only film ,that IMDb shouldn't care about spoilers,because you can't spoil a storyline that doesn't exist. Ridiculous ,shockingly bad,laughable but clever(clever in that they succeeded, in taking money from my pocket, for watching it).When i have watched over maybe 5000 films ,i used to gloat that i can smell from kilometers away the ""potatoes""(a phrase that means really really bad films).Not any more.Maybe when i reach 10000 films, i will have the power to save my self from the next Inception.",0
"As long as it remains possible to spend 100 million dollars on making drivel, setting aside 10 million towards advertising in order to tell people that it's great so that they've spent 200 million on tickets before they find out otherwise, there'll be no incentive for Hollywood movie-making ever to improve.I've reviewed Angelina Jolie's latest farrago in very similar terms. While that movie bizarrely assumes that the Cold War still remains of interest to anyone (?), ""Inception"" insists basically that it's interesting to watch other people's dreams. Well, visually it can be - the ""architecture-bending"" style of ""Inception"" would have had great appeal, maybe in a 60-second advert for a credit card or mobile phone company.But visual appeal aside, the ""plot"" of the movie is not so much multi-layered as multi- pointless. The old cliché that ""if you die in dream you wake up"" is hauled out here with monotonous regularity, but it's never applied consistently, and even if it were, who cares? If you MUST fire a machine gun at someone in a dream (and I can't think of any reason why you'd really need to), why would you ever run out of bullets? Wouldn't you just dream up some more? If you want to blow up a dream hotel, do you really NEED dream explosives? If the fuse goes out, is it safe to return, or should you always light the dreamy blue touchpaper and stand well back? The movie's makers assume that multi-layering these various dream levels will be endlessly fascinating (as evidenced by the enormous running time), but anyone with an ounce of discernment will simply become less and less connected as the plot becomes ""deeper"". We're in the same childish, ill-conceived territory here as many movies about existing in ""virtual reality"" or even ""on the holodeck"". Simulate as convincingly as you like, but you can't change the laws of physics in the real world, and if you're in a dream, then there's no real need to worry about being stabbed or shot, and neither should the viewer care whether the characters are, or aren't.The urban myth being put about that ""Inception"" includes some sort of interesting or unexpected ending is no more than that.For a witty, snappy meditation on alternative reality, try Cronenberg's ""eXistenZ"", and (despite the fact that, like, when you're dreaming you know, your life goes really slowly and, like, you can live a whole lifetime in the dreamy dream state, man) try to give this bloated waste of time a miss.",0
"I truly cannot understand why anyone would call this a good film. Fancy special effects, yeah, plenty many lots... but special effects do not make a film. It also needs a storyline that doesn't shoot in every direction, left, right, backwards and forwards throughout the entire film for lack of substance.OK, so the dude wants to plant an idea in someone's brain. Got that after a minute or so of viewing. And then what? It feels too much like a storm in a teacup.Frederic Dard (french novelist) used to describe futuristic gadgets by means of expressions like ""he's pointing a gloombobber with spiral condensing palchromium in my direction"" but, being a talented writer, he had the good taste of limiting such eccentric nonsense to a single sentence per book, whereas Inception is made up of nothing but that from beginning to end. Each time the dream-team runs into a potential nag, there comes a gloombobber out of a hat. Too predictable after a while. ""This can't be done in a three-dimensional space... no problem, we'll do it in seven!"" would be an adequate tag-line for Inception.I couldn't follow the storyline and am not convinced there actually was one. It reminded me of the Brownian movement observed at the surface of a pot of boiling water. It was so confusing that switching actors every two minutes for the part of the main character would have gone unnoticed in this maelstrom of nonsensical garbage.In conclusion I don't see any point in watching Inception unless you're extremely high on speed or a fan of special effects who doesn't give a whoopdeedo about well-constructed stories in the first place.",0
"Philosophically it was absurd. Here were the main points I gathered from it:? Faith and doubt are discussed, but the conclusion is that having faith doesn't matter because you can't know what's real anyways. What did the Japanese businessman's non-faith avail him or di Caprio's character's faith avail him? They both ended up having the same destiny, no? So, freewill is an illusion, too.? Skepticism is the only valid approach to life.? Existentialism is true; we really do make life to be whatever we want it to be. Top remains spinning at end, or does it eventually topple? Was it dream or reality? Who knows? Does it matter? No, existentialism says we can define our own reality to our liking.? Relativism of truth: i.e., truth is whatever you make it up to be.? Subjectivism / idealism / Cartesianism / Kantianism, i.e., ideas are all that are real. If the senses are to be 100% distrusted for determining what is real, we might all be as insane (possessed) as the Dark Knight's Joker.? Objective reality, for all practical purposes, does not exist. Every subject just makes up his or her own reality. This leads to solipsism and ultimately a suicidal nihilism.? Murder can be justified as long as the person you are killing is someone's ""projection."" Di Caprio's character snipes men in the snow scene to the architect girl's surprise; he justifies this by saying they are just another man's ""projection.""? Magic potions (i.e., potent drugs) are the solution to anyone's problems.Christopher Nolan should brush-up on some real, Aristotelean-Thomistic philosophy, but then maybe the movie would not have fooled the audience into thinking it is profound instead of absurd. There were good parts_the importance of fatherhood and family, for example_but they were overshadowed by ambiguity for the sake of ambiguity.Also, artistically, it could've done without most of the car-chase and shooting scenes and confronted more head-on the philosophical issue it was raising, i.e., ""What is real? What is being, existence? Etc,"" rather than hiding its ignorance in a silly plot scheme involving ""kicks,"" ""inception,"" and other Freudian, postmodern rubbish. If it were 1 hour shorter, it would have still been the same: absurdity at its best.",0
"Siigh...okay, it took me a whole week to decide to put my thoughts about this disappointing crapfest down in writing, so here goes...I do not agree with those reviews that state this is an ""original"" idea of Nolan's. Haven't you people seen the anime film, ""Paprika?"" And what about ""The Matrix""? Those movies, to me, did a MUCH BETTER job in dealing with the concept of dreams and the distortion between them as far as what exactly ARE dreams and what exactly IS reality? IMHO, ""INCEPTION"" was a mess. To me, and to a lot of other people, it was ambiguous just for the sake of being ambiguous.Just one of my many beefs about this movie was that dreams should be amorphic. People's faces, backgrounds, should've been somewhat distorted or at least a little blurry. Things should not have been so artfully contrived. Most if not ALL dreams, are not so well crafted or constructed down to the last detail. All we got with ""INCEPTION"" was falling buildings??! Really? There was NOTHING dream-like about ANY of those scenes. Even when Ellen Page ""oh-so-perfectly"" designed, maneuvered and constructed bridges and mirrors and other crap. Gimme a break! Everything was just WAAAYY too convenient and perfectly timed down to the minute. And what the hell is ""LIMBO""??? What, we're all just supposed to accept this kind of blatantly crappy inexplicable science-fiction?And even though some things don't always HAVE to be explained, the mystery surrounding the dream ""device"" and that dream ""drug"" wasn't all that interesting. I was able to suspend my disbelief in movies like ""Paprika"" and ""The Matrix"" because not only were those story lines just way more cohesive(as far as story arcs are concerned), I was also given enough exposition to actually CARE about some of the characters. I didn't get to that point with ""INCEPTION"". Even though I really liked Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's characters, I didn't really give a crap if they got sent to?wait for it?.the limbo of no return. God. It actually made me wince to type that.Like many reviews so aptly and succinctly stated, this movie simply hobbled along due to a seriously weak exposition and atrocious plot pacing. It was VERY self-indulgent. And the ending was not only predictable, it insulted my intelligence. Nolan is one of the most overrated directors out there, and this movie is just another vehicle for his enormous ego to perpetuate the notion that he's a genius when he's really a hack. He may have some really good ideas and concepts, but he SUCKS on his follow through. He knows how to generate the hype machine, which makes people feel like, if they didn't ""get"" or ""like"" one of his movies, then they're not part of the really ""cool"" and ""in"" sub-culture of our times. Just like with TDK, which I think was and still is THE most overrated movie of our time.Don't buy into the hype. Stop letting ol' Nolan boy pull the strings. If one of his movies sucks, then it sucks. There's nothing at all wrong, uncool or apocryphal about that. It just IS. And this DID.And come on, people! This movie in NO WAY deserves a rating above a 9 or an 8! Try about a 6.5. No higher.",0
"UNDERWHELMING, LITERAL AND PRETENTIOUS.. These 3 words pretty much summed up the whole of Inception. Why populate the dream world with the same landscape and tone as the real world? Why the dreamers and their subconscious armed with real-world accessories and firearms? Why must the travel initiated with the actor's pretend sleep? Why does the levels are differentiated with only different decor? (Except the LIMBO realm) WHERE IS THE IMAGINATION? Nolan has the perfect opportunity to execute his wildest imaginations and he messed it up and served us mediocrity. Apparently, he only has the most literal interpretation of dreams. No quirky visual manifestation (mirror-world? top-down switched?), no mystical representation of the subconscious (shadows, shades, animals etc), No difference between dream levels (tones-darker?grayer?more grotesque?), No symbolic representative of weapons ( energy? aura's? light? dark? ). AND OF COURSE, the travel method!NOLAN could've presented a more sophisticated facade. Maybe a dream room with vivid machines powered with mysterious matter. Or for mobility, more visible contraptions for head, neck or body. Then, the transition can be cued with portals, or one's self entering the target's body or....to be more fantastical; the reality bleeds or tears itself into an underworld which is the dream.INSTEAD, what we've got is inferior chase and action set pieces. Save for the gimmicks of collapsing the landscape onto itself, making pathways, the movie's rather bland. It also features too many characters - the forgers, architects, point man, sedative-man, corporate-sponsor man.......you get it. IT SHOULD be anchored by one solid protagonist that's let say have a latent talent for some form of ability (dream-walker but is named with Latin words), his target and the source of his internal conflicts (family, lover, friend).This movie fools layman into thinking that they're smart.IT is basically an inferior imitation of Michael Bay's summer blockbuster disguised as a thinking man's movie. IT'S ABOUT CORPORATE ESPIONAGE - Tell people that and it would be 100% true. CERTAINLY NOT travel between dream worlds....",0
"A visual Tour De Force that gets lost in its own complex world, Inception stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb; a rogue 'extractor' who steals elements of dreams and sells them to the highest bidder, all in the name of corporate espionage. But things start to go drastically wrong when Cobb takes on a seemingly impossible job and his dead wife turns up to make trouble.Ingenious but convoluted, Inception may not be to everyone's taste _ but it is undoubtedly a Chris Nolan picture; the same man who gave us Memento, The Prestige and of course, The Dark Knight. The problem is that for all the slick visuals and clever narrative structures, we end up with something cold, clinical and frustratingly diffuse.Why Inception falters, and I appreciate that I may be in the minority, is that for such a surreal and imaginative concept to work, it requires an equally surreal and imaginative mind, and Nolan is just too conservative and too technical for the content. It might have made a more interesting film had it been directed by P.T Anderson or, dare I say it, Terry Gilliam.",0
"After reading all the amazing reviews and seeing a score of 9.3...3rd best movie of all time, I had to go watch Inception. Also I really like Memento...it was such a cool, original movie..so I was looking forward to this.I went to see this movie last weekend. It was an 11:00pm showing on Sunday night, 3 weeks after opening night and the theatre was packed! We had to sit in the second row...something I don't mind at all.Epic Fail The movie is about corporate (not even government) spies, that enter people's dreams through some unexplained technology. Once in the dream, they trick the victim into giving up his/her secrets. Pretty simple premise, and one that can be taken into many directions (after all we're in dreamland). Well the direction is down the crapper.The whole premise of the movie is so shallow, Saito, a corporate CEO hires Cobb (Leo) to go into another CEO's dream and plant an idea of breaking up his fathers empire (upon his father's death), so that Saito can have a monopoly. How's that for a story?? What a joke.Well the movie starts slow and drags on and on, besides that there are so many plot holes and explaining of everything that happens..like they manipulate the victim by having a dream, within a dream, within a dream. When you are falling in the first dream, the second layer has no gravity, but the third and forth layer has gravity?? WHAAAA??? Also even though you are in a dream, you have no super powers..you use boring guns? How about shooting lighting bolts out your you know what?? BOOORRING.To add to the boredom, Cobb's wife Mal killed herself because she thought she was dreaming. And appears regularly to bore us to death, you get the sense that she's supposed to be evil, but it never pans out.This was interesting on one level only...there was no antagonist. But then again there was no love interest either, and on top of that no danger, cause if you get killed in a dream, all you do is wake up.This movie is amoral tripe with no imagination..eg. you are in a dream world, instead of driving around in a VAN, why not fly? Instead of shooting guns, why not freeze them in their tracks? Also, there are many people (I assume teenagers) who are saying how original this movie is. The Dream within a Dream thing has been done before...it's called ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors""..also don't EVER compare this tripe to the ""Matrix"". Matrix was original, it was filled with clever allegory, it was truly awe inspiring, but there was NOTHING clever about Inceptipon.The climax was okay, but just because after 2 hours I couldn't wait to get out of there.Now the anti-climax, is an entirely different animal, like the viewer hasn't been insulted enough...we are left to ponder weather it was ""all a dream"" (again not very original). The answer is yes, it was all a dream, and Cobb is still in a dream..his kids look exactly the same, even wearing the same clothes as his other dreams.Please do yourself a favour and do not pay to see this garbage. So far the best movie this summer has been Predators...how sad. People think this movie is clever and original because they are teenagers..it probably is clever and original to them, but any adult will find this movie dull and boring. Inception = Fail IMDb for having Inception in your top 3 movies = EPIC FAIL.If I was the credibility Nazi, I'd say to IMDb ""NO CREDIBILITY FOR YOU!""2/10 for exploiting a big budget.",0
"This tried to be another matrix - but a) there was already one matrix b) as silly as the matrix is, this is much sillier c) the matrix had some personality, this move has no feel whatsoeverBest example of the lameness would be the ""introduction scene"" where Dicaprio's character (totally forgettable) shows the young architect the dream world. This scene was totally forgettable compared to the epic action scene between Morpheous and Neo (""Stop trying to hit me and hit me"")Also - there is hardly any build up - it goes from 2 layers of dreams to 6, whats the build up? more layers of dreams?

"Seriously? Mesmerizing? Fantastic? Genius? No.I was pretty excited about this film after all the hype, and I feel massively let down. The plot was overly drawn out and repetitive, and there was an over-reliance on action, with massive portions of the plot being taken up by filler scenes of silly shoot-outs and car chases.Christopher Nolan has given this film a superficial sheen of meaningfulness, with the admittedly astounding visuals covering for a plot so full of holes it's almost falling apart. Why are Dom and Mal shown as having grown old and grey together in limbo when they are also shown laying their head on train lines to escape limbo as 30-somethings? Why does the incessant music come to dominate the film, making every scene feel climactic, which is actually detrimental to the final climax? In a similar manner to the way in which the Wachowski brothers took the brilliant writings of Baudrillard and completely mangled them beyond all meaning in The Matrix, Nolan has taken a great idea and turned it into a teenage boy's shoot-em-up action fantasy. People might watch it and think ""Wow, that's really deep"". No, it's not. It has the appearance of being deep and meaningful when in fact it's just a shallow action film.I'm sure people will read this review and think ""she just doesn't get it"". The problem is that I do it get. Unfortunately there's just not a lot to get.",0
"Wow what have we here? What hast thou put before our eyes? Could it be Christopher Nolan's boorish tripe 'Inception'? I myself could not tell as the movie was far too low brow to make even the slightest impression on my vastly superior intelligence. Nolan is an amateur who makes movies based on blatantly foreseeable childish artifices that only the most unintelligent boors would find the least bit amusing. 'Inception' is the kind of film designed to make lamebrains feel like they are intelligent. Nolan's intellectualism-for-dummies should be the main title of his biography. Luckily I am smart enough to see past this charade and give the people their fair assessment of this tripe.'Inception' is built upon the notion of traveling through dream like spaces that bend time, space, and reality, yawn. It's been done before Chris in a much sounder fashion in Charlie Kaufman's epic masterpiece 'Synecdoche, New York'. That film is an orgasmic experience while 'Inception' is just beyond words describing it. I mean you might conclude that the inner subconscious would be more creative in coming up with better metaphors for security than guys with guns who chase you. The lengthy exposition- oh I mean training montage, despite having a semi-acceptable computer effect, was way more boring and less engaging than the scene it stole from 'The Matrix', and at least that scene didn't have Nolan's pretentiousness. Larry the Cable Guy is less insulting to the intellect. I mean Sarah Palin sounds smarter than Christopher Nolan's dialogue. ( Conjointly, the Herculean careener of mesh networks is titled Ariadne? Really? None of the juveniles that give you your millions will get that reference Chris but I'm glad you know how to use wikipedia)",0
"Ten years he did about this story, Christopher Nolan. I hardly understand what is so difficult to understand about this would be intellectual piece of rubbish about a dream within a dream within a dream. This is just what Night M Shyamalan has done in all of his movies. Boring us to death with a boring story for about 9/10th of the movie and then to give us an 'amazing ending', the ending here being that in fact it is not a three layered dream but about a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream so 4 layers, at least that's what my impression is as the spinning thing at the end is the talisman of either the wife or Leonard di Caprio.From the trailer this seemed to be a brilliant movie but I should have been warned by my colleagues from work, one leaving the theater before the ending and all of the others not understanding what the fuss was all about and right they are.Before this year I never believed that Leonardo di Caprio was able to play adult characters (if any at all) after watching Titanic years ago. Now I'm dead sure of it after watching Shutter island and Inception this year.Characters without character so you don't give a damn about them; endless ridiculously action scenes certainly towards the end working to an action climax that is incredibly foreseeable (dream layers ending at the same time); heavy pseudo sophisticated acting that gets on your nerves quickly. In one sentence: the biggest scam since The matrix though the Wachowski brothers are even bigger crooks as they scammed the world three times. What idiots us the public are, are we not? I have no problem with 'amazing ending' movies at least if they would make the effort to give you a story leading up to it. Here there is none.I agree there are really serious bad things to get offended about in the world, but when we feel offended in real life about being conned with situations or a product, we should be too when we are scammed in the movie theater.The 1 point I give for this movie is for the 'street bending' special effect (the other effects being rather tedious and pure special effects for the effect).",0
"I have never lost interest in a film faster than this one, and I have watched some pretty terrible movies e.g. paranormal activity! (like when the girl gets dragged a...way! OMG never laughed so much in my life b4!) . It was a ridiculous waste of resources that could have been put towards ... I dunno folding socks? How they managed to make it so ""popular"" I do not know.It was pretentious more than anything. It had this strange, ""this is the best film of all time because we folded a street over"" vibe to it. It was nothing but special effects which i must say were nice but the actual story itself was perpetuated with unspecified technology, chemicals, rules and really bad acting from some really good actors! When you watch a film of this caliber and I use the term lightly, you should be entertained, not bored and scared. They told the story in less than five minutes!***** Don't read this bit if you plan on watching the film ******* They have to change the mind of a guy whose dad is dying; for money and they do it by going into his brain in three levels THAT IS ALL IT IS! SERIOUSLY THAT IS THE WHOLE STORY ALL THE REST IS FILLER!!!!!*******************************************************************They might of as well put in Peter Griffin grabbing his knee in pain and the naive audience would be none the wiser. It isn't a clever film! It isn't even entertainment. It's just noise!",0
"Boring. Overlong. Stupefying. Cheap.It's easy to fool a sheep. Take an idea with great potential and then throw it in a barrel and burn it. Then throw a banal senseless story that barely looks complex, mix it with cheap action and waste over 2 hours of everyones lives. And the sheep rejoice because they think it is intelligent, daring, original and emotional. The truth is sad; it's just another generic Hollywood blockbuster action set in a ,,fantastic'' setting. It insults intelligence and anyone with an IQ > 70 gets it, and the majority praises it for it's emptiness because only that can they understand. These types of movies make me wonder if we really deserved a comet in 2012.",0
"I'll begin by saying that I have an inbuilt prejudice against films that seem to put cleverness or 'intelligence' ahead of entertainment value. Having read a lot about this film, I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but in fact was very disappointed to end up disliking it as much as I did.For me, the film lacked two essential elements of an entertaining movie - a coherent plot and sympathetic characters. The plot didn't really start to make any sense until about halfway through (far too late) and Leonardo di Caprio as the central character, Cobb, was competent but just didn't have the charisma to carry this kind of story. His wife's death was foreshadowed a lot in the early part of the film and I found I just didn't care how or why she died. None of the other characters came across as real people and their connection to Cobb was generally unclear to me. The impression was of good actors (like Tom Hardy) being basically wasted.I almost switched off the film after the first twenty minutes because its chaotic action seemed designed almost to alienate the viewer. It started to make some sense after that, but was still a long way from what a good film should be. The over-reliance on sudden loud noises (way above the level of the dialogue) in the first half was simply irritating.The film also seemed to have trouble obeying its own internal logic. Several reviewers have mentioned that there was no consistency in what is supposed to happen when a dreamer dies during a dream; I was unimpressed by the 'projections' in the dreams apparently having their own personalities and being capable of independent thought, although the script also had them as nothing more than figments of the dreamer's imagination.Yes, the film's settings and special effects were impressive, but that's really not what an evening out (or in) should be about. If the story and characterisations are lacking, then why bother watching at all?",0
"some people, who liked that movie wrote that we all have to ""understand"" this movie to find it good and those who didn't, are rating it as awfulDAMN these inception lovers are wrong i understood this AWFUL movie, he (cobb) is a dream extractor who extracts the thought and other stuff of ppl and this time he has to put a thought in.....bla bla bla at the end (which is damn ****) he doesn't wake up from this dream zone(dunno the English word) and i ask myself : where the **** are the bad guys?? ahh there aren't any... what are you freaking kidding me??? its a dream so there is no need for bad guys... BAH i really was disappointed cause i expected some BAD GUYS and some more special effects CAUSE THEY WERE IN A ******* DREAM in other words the move is awful its waste of time and the money in to worth it",0
"Inception indeed has all the marks of a bad film. This is not just apparent in the film itself, but comments fan make.""If you don't like this movie, it's because you don't get it!"" ""If you don't like this movie, you lack class!""These sorts of things are the same things I hear when one of my hipster friends gives me a CD of some band nobody's heard of, and when I press Play, I immediately figure out why. When you like a movie that is identifiably bad, you have to come up with excuses for liking it that aren't tomfoolery, like ""you just don't get it, MAN. It's too ironic for your puritanical tastes!""In the end, I find that the film itself, fans aside, is not terribly thrilling. The ideas aren't original_it was like a Matrix in the dream world. Except a bad one, because nothing gets explained, really. Watching Inception was like watching the story of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 play out. The question I kept asking myself was ""okay, why is so-and-so doing THAT?"" At the end of the movie, I decided that Christopher Nolan, like George Lucas, is talented, but has gotten too full of himself. Why do I care about Cobb's kids, to whom we are granted no real introduction? Why do I care about dueling energy companies? Why do I care about a bunch of corporate hit men and mob bosses? There's no connection.An emotional connection is something lacking, but more frustratingly is the disappearance of character development about 15 minutes in. Everything gets lost at about that point actually. The logic of the plot, the coherence of the plot, everything. It's baffling to me. I loved The Dark Knight and The Prestige_they hit that sweet spot in between baffling and straightforward. Inception missed the mark horribly.__SPOILERS DO NOT CROSS__By far, the ending is the most ridiculous. It's a contradictory ending. Although we see the top is clearly falling, and Cobb is not wearing his ring, the children look the same as they did.__SPOILERS DO NOT CROSS__",0
"well, well, well, oh hang on, I need another well......crap, crap, crap, and yes another crap......The concept of going in a dream and stealing or planting ideas is probably acceptable, even a dream within a dream is palatable, but hey guys - let's go to the third level and while we're there, let's try for the fourth as well - what a messy, badly scripted piece of junk. This movie is all over the place and whilst you can follow it with the concentration of a chess master, the plot and storyline is weak and rather pathetic. Wasted a lot of time watching this one, so do yourself a favour and go mow the lawn or something ! Save your money and wait for the DVD if you're curious.",0
"But not for me. The movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired convoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an alternative dream-tactic because their target protects himself. What they consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and unoriginal that becomes clear with a 'kick' that Nolan was absolutely unaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot. The plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an ""intellectual"" challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror of the other. The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot stumbles from one hole to the next:How do they get connected so that can dream the same dream? Chemically, physically?? How can they transport their conscious plans into their unconscious dreams and execute them there? Etc., Etc.I can't help it, but Nolan is one of the few directors in Hollywood who can direct any script as tedious as you can imagine. There are so many moments in that movie where i thought Wow, that could have been much more suspenseful if, for instance, Cameron or so had directed it.This movie is stupid. You can make a stupid plot 'intelligent' by nesting it multiple times, it just multiplies its stupidity. In this sense the next Nolan movie could be a even greater ""masterpiece"" for meat heads: when it has a dump base plot every fool can follow, but this time the plot is the plot in the plot in the plot in the plot in the.....that's challenging isn't it?",0
"Where to begin? Well,the soundtrack is unnecessarily loud, noisy and repetitious and consequently extremely irritating!!!!!!!!! How many times can you crank the big violin sound up? hOW MANY EXCLAMATION POINTS DO YOU NEED? hIT ME OVER THE HEAD SOME MORE!!! pLEASE!!!! I felt it didn't sync with the film at all. God help those folks whose neighbors have surround sound and play this at even normal volume. After 30 minutes of this I'm ready to #*&%#$%%.With regard to the film itself, it's the same 15 minutes of plot over and over and over until you want to throw up! I ""got it"" after the first 30 minutes but apparently this director believes his audience is comprised of morons who enjoy spending 2 1/2 hours watching pointless gun battles and cars crashing. And it appears that his conclusion may be true based on the gushing praise for this over-hyped grade ""C"" movie. Little of this ""special effects"" activity advances the film in a significant way. How boorish! By far one of the worst acclaimed films I've ever seen. I'd rather go to the dentist than sit through this. My biggest regret is I can never regain the time I spent on this utterly silly piece of #$@&*^%*.",0
"Di Caprio plays Cobb, an expert in extracting information from people's minds by infiltrating a target's dream. In return for a new identity, which will allow him again to go to the States to be with his kids, Cobb is challenged to now plant an idea in someone's mind in stead of retrieving it.The premise of the film is rather silly but it's the execution that truly ruins the film. The major issue is without a doubt the exposition ridden dialog which didn't progress the overall plot or added anything in terms of character development. In stead we get the most expensive cast doing little else than yammer on and on about the totally uninteresting and far-fetched technical methods that are involved in dream infiltration as Nolan's showcases his unimaginative and clueless take on the Sci-Fi genre. In between these witless and thoroughly boring expositions, we get treated to the action clichés from every Bond movie that has ever graced the silver screen in the past 3 or 4 decades while the pounding soundtrack gets louder and louder simply with every subsequent scene.Where was the conflict in this story needed to create viewer involvement? Who exactly were we expected to root for? Why was everything happening in this film without exception utterly implausible? Why do people find this movie to be complex when the film spends about 95% of the script explaining what is going on. And why wasn't this hapless script nominated for a couple of Razzies?The fans are right, I don't get it.",0
"Before Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to play the lead part in 'Inception', he spent months with Christopher Nolan trying to improve the script. It was at DiCaprio's insistence that the part he was playing, Cobb, the corporate dream extractor, had to have a more beefed up internal arc. Otherwise, Inception would turn out to be another shallow, action adventure thriller. Despite Cobb's triumph over his internal demons (particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife, who has been haunting him in his subconscious), Inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis. At the basic level, Inception can be divided into four distinct parts: Intro, Exposition, Journey and Resolution. The Intro consists of the initial scene, a flashback where Cobb must save his employer, a sleazy Japanese businessman, Saito, now far advanced in years, who has been stuck in a limbo-like purgatory for decades, unaware that he was mortally wounded in someone else's dream. It's a nice, little compact scene where we see a near-dead Cobb, washed up on a beach and dragged into Saito's fortress compound. A gun is left on the table in front of Saito and we're trying to figure out whether Saito is going to kill Cobb or himself. Cut to the next scene where Cobb and his associate are involved in a trying to extract information from a much younger Saito inside one of his dreams, as they all sleep on a bullet train somewhere in Japan. Apparently, Saito was expecting the dream extractors and informs them that this is their 'audition'; the extractors' 'architect', the guy in charge of designing the dreamworld, somehow lets things get out of control when a mob of men invade the room where they're all staying, and Saito later has his thugs toss the architect off the roof of a heliport. Despite the botched job, Saito is impressed that Cobb and his partner are able to move through different 'levels' in the dreamworld. Cobb's 'audition' could have been compressed into one or two minutes but Nolan insists on illustrating every aspect of his convoluted plot. We finally arrive at the film's inciting incident: Saito's proposal to Cobb that he enter the dream world of his business rival, Fischer, and plant a suggestion in his subconscious, leading to the dissolution of the rival's entire business empire. 'Inception' is the reverse of what Cobb and his team have been trained to do_extracting information and Cobb has doubts about successfully carrying out Saito's proposal. But when Saito promises to pull some strings, enabling Cobb to return to the United States, despite murder charges hanging over his head, Cobb can't resist jumping at the chance to see his two children again.The next part of 'Inception', the 'exposition', takes about an hour. This is where Cobb assembles his new carefully selected ""Mission Impossible"" superstar team who will penetrate Fischer's mind and plant the suggestion to break up his dying father's business empire. Nolan's explanation of the mechanics of the dreamworld is so complicated, that he has Cobb explain it to his new architect, a naive graduate student who manages to acquit herself rather well despite facing major obstacles inside multiple dreamworlds. Nolan manages to violate a major tenet of screen writing technique: Show don't tell. Unfortunately, during these expository sequences, there's a lot more 'tell' than 'show'. Yes, there is a rather neat scene (reminiscent of an M. C. Escher illustration), where one Paris landscape folds on top of another but most of the visuals are much more mundane: for example, a speeding locomotive appears out of nowhere during a car chase on a Paris street.Much has been written about the 'journey' aspect of 'Inception'. Critics seem to be impressed by the three dreamworlds the 'dream team' penetrates, coupled with the way in which they're able to return to reality_the so-called 'kicks', where a huge sound or explosion propels them through the different levels back up to the surface. Nolan, however, serves up some of the dullest and derivative landscapes that our 'heroes' must navigate through_in fact, these so-called dreams don't look like dreams at all. Take Level 1_just a typical shoot em up with faceless bad guys chasing the 'good guys'. As for level 2_I felt I was watching a parody of Space Odyssey, with our dreamers floating through a hotel without the benefit of gravity. Finally, I have heard 'Level 3', compared to 'Ice Station Zebra', the schlocky 60s action film set in the Arctic.Inception's Resolution is as unsatisfying as the earlier parts of the film. What are we to make of Cobb? Just because he has made this deal with Saito and it enables him to see his children, does not mitigate the fact that the whole plan to literally change Fischer's mind, is reprehensible. After all, shouldn't have Cobb walked away when Saito had his men murder the first architect? Cobb, by and large, remains a tainted and unsympathetic character, precisely because he looks the other way when he's quite aware that Saito has committed murder.We're also told (by Saito) that the breakup of Fischer's empire is a good thing but should we take his word for it? He's a thug and Nolan has provided us nothing to go on to evaluate the nature of the Fischer empire. Finally, why does Fischer cry at his father's deathbed? He's just learned that his father put his mother in a mental institution so shouldn't he be angry? Or are those tears of joy so that he can be now 'his own man'?The bulk of 'Inception' is merely a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s when the genre was in full bloom. The long-winded 'B' story, Cobb's tortured machinations in trying to literally kick his dead wife out of his subconscious mind, merely serves to distract us from the hollowness of the overall plot.",0
"First the good news. The movie contains decent action sequences. The acting is OK, some exceptions left aside.Apart from that, this movie is overrated.The characters are one-dimensional. The story is predictable. About acting, Di Caprio can you make believe everything, except that this is a good movie. The actors try to perform and get something out of the script, but sometimes you can see them struggle and that can not be the purpose.Score is about 9 at the moment of writing, that's higher rated than all movies of Hitchcock... Are you kidding me ?",0
"The 150 minutes in the theater seemed like 1500 minutes.Great idea. Good visuals. Horrible production. After all, what was I watching? Whom I liked? Who was the bad guy? Why were things happening on the screen? And, why for so long? That last never-ending sequence on ice. Had no idea who was doing what and why.I did understand the concept as I was prepared for it after hearing from so many people about the 'complex' script. But to me, it was plain stupid. The producers had money and wanted to use it in action sequence and special effects. Did those fit the plot? Not really. This movie didn't need much action, to be honest. The movie should have stimulated our brains, not ear drums.Anyway I went because of the hype. Should have known better. But then, it was a dollar theater and Sunday night when Texas Rangers and Steelers both were losing. So, it was OK.",0
"Why would Saito hire a group of people for a job when they couldn't even accomplish their first job extracting information from his mind? Wouldn't he want to hire people with a better success ratio? Cobb says he's the best and then his whole team fails right after, so... I guess perception is subjective eh? LolWhy did Cobb rush to the belief that accepting Saito's inception job offer would also solve his law troubles so he could return back the states on faith alone so quickly? Wouldn't he want to know more information about him first before accepting the offer? When he talks to Michael Caine in the lecture hall he sounds overwhelmingly convinced the job offer is the solution to everything, but why? Overacting?Where did the first ""kick"" come from to trigger the avalanche in the 3rd level if JGL hadn't blown the floor in the 2nd level and the van hadn't hit the water in the 1st level?How also was JGL on Level 2 with only ""3 minutes"" remaining able to make it down a flight of stairs and fight/kill a guy in the process, then fight/kill a guy in the hallway while bouncing around, THEN find the time to rope and bundle all of his comrades, push them into the elevator and THEN blow it.When Fischer dies on Level 3 and gets pushed into Level 4/Limbo, why is Level 4 Cobb's world? Shouldn't it still be Fischer's limbo world since they're all still inside his multi-layered dream??Every few years, I rewatch this movie hoping to get insight into why so many people consider it in their Top 5 of all-time, but it falls short every time.
Yes the CGI and slow-mo is uber creative and cool and the concept is a nice spin on the ""dream within a dream"" trope, but a little more attention to the story setup would've been nice to add some plausibility. Suspension of disbelief really only stretches so far in the minds of your audience, not to mention Marion Cotillard and Leonardo Dicaprio have ZERO on-screen chemistry with each other and we're supposed to believe they were married and he can't get over her? Eh...Names...
Dom Cobb, Mal Cobb, Ariadne...
There's something that feels pretentious about the character names chosen for the story. None of them seem to fit any particular person terribly well, which adds to their unrelatability. Even though you know the names of Cobb's children, it feels like he's fighting to get back to the ""idea"" of them, but you don't get any sense of why really? Come to think of it - most characters in the movie feel like ""ideas of people"" instead of multi-dimensional characters we can invest in. Granted not every movie requires a backstory for every character, but I do want to at least care about some of them?Cobb doesn't emanate love for who his kids actually are and we get no real sense of them as people. They're one-dimensional plot devices used to justify his obsession, which is incredibly disappointing. I would feel a lot more for Cobb's struggle if we could actually feel for and empathize with the people that matter (or are ""supposed to matter"") most in Cobb's life. Also, who the hell is his children staying with after he flees the country? Their grandmother we're meant to insinuate from the earlier phone conversation? If he was able to arrange for them to have someone to stay with, he would've had time to see their faces again, no? Are the grandparents divorced or why does Michael Caine's grandpa work and live in a different country than grandma but will still be able to bring home ""presents"" for Cobb's kids? Is he flying back to the states after the semester? Who gives Cobb the suggestion/plane ticket to flee in the first place and why does he have to leave at that EXACT moment? You mean to tell me he couldn't have taken 5 seconds to run outside and wave goodbye to his kids to see their faces even while in a rush? Yeah, no.And how long has Cobb been gone from the states exactly after he fled? A few months, a few years? If it's the latter and the kids still haven't aged at the end of the movie, why is everyone asking if Cobb is still dreaming? They're literally wearing exactly the same outfits and have the same hairstyles as the day he left however long ago lmao.I wonder if the studio execs demanded Christopher Nolan cut down the movie's runtime significantly which subsequently removed a lot of the necessary plot setup scenes, which would be a damn shame. Nolan is a great director, but I doubt an extra 10/20 minutes to smooth out and not rush through all of the aforementioned issues would've been that big of an issue. They did a disservice to what could've been a truly great story, hence why I keep rewatching.",0
"Many fine actors involved in this disaster ... including a favorite French actress, Marion Cotillard. The visuals were super, the action very good, the acting well done ... but the story was absolute nonsense. Had I taken a triple dose of LSD, I could not have hallucinated anything as bizarre and crazy as this ""story."" Save your time and your money ... ANYTHING else that De Caprio OR Cotillard has done will be FAR more rewarding than this mess.",0
"Of course, I had heard lots about this movie and actually love track #12 from the OST (by Zimmer), but I'd never made an effort to go watch it. Something in my mind told me it wouldn't be worth it. Besides, I'm not much impressed by DiCaprio's acting skills.Still, after a long while I wanted to see what the fuss is about. I am checking out numerous films people recommend as 'best of 2010' to me.Inception was waaaaay too shallow for me. It's a superficial action film that admittedly looks visually nice, but there's no real drama. It actually bored me. Left me cold.If you want to see a 2010 film including DiCaprio, go see Shutter Island. Much, much better, but not great, which is too bad.Anyway, I don't want to spend too many words on this Inception creation. Yawn.",0
"Inception - I saw this a while ago. I only write about it, because South Park was making fun of it last night. I never got the enthusiasm for this flick. It was somewhat entertaining, although, certainly not mind blowing or even that inventive. I've seen more mind bending things on the Outer Limits from the 60's. It was not memorable. In fact, I had forgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was how poorly Ellen Page's character was rounded out. I remember laughing, not at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain everything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action was cliché, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into someone's dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...South Park, on the other hand. Was a lot more fun. Throw in a Sheep Herder, a young Mr. Mackey, a random pizza delivery guy, and even a retired Freddy Kruger and you've got an entertaining 22 minutes. And, of course, Randy Marsh. Stan is trapped in Mr. Mackey's dream, so Randy goes in to save him. Stan sees his dad in the dream. But his dad has come into the dream as a Butterfly. Stan says ""Did you come here to help me?"" and Randy replies ""I was gonna...Butterflies have no concern for these things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterfly poon."" So much better than watching inception.",0
"Boring movie with no meaning and only a few fancy special effects. Special effects were not even all that good. Just a few slow motion anti-gravity scenes. Even the Matrix would have been boring without some kind of ""meaning of life"" stuff. You need more than star power to make a good movie. I kept thinking the movie would have intriguing thought provoking idea, but it was so predictable. It turned into a real snooze. The premise of the movie is not enough to carry the entire movie. Using dreams to influence behavior is a concept that has been used many times effectively. Such as SG-1 when the Harcesus teaches Daniel that power would corrupt him through a dream. But this movie has no uplifting message.",0
"I have never felt more against the critical and commercial spotlight than I did in Inception. I felt it was okay, not bad, but certainly not good. The plot is weighted down by brainless action scenes added by Director Nolan just to keep people watching amidst the confusion. I prefer action that has more relevance when I am watching a film. The film's main focus is dreams, but I did not feel like I was in a dream, only a web of destruction at the hands of computer generated explosions! I think there is a certain creativity in Inception, however it was lost amidst the lack of comprehensive filmmaking and intelligent screen writing.",0
"*MAJOR SPOILER ALERT* The biggest problem with Inception was that I had no incentive to care about any of the characters or what happened to them. Other then built in pathos (dead wife guilt issues? Check. Daddy issues? Check? Missing your family? Check) there was no real drama or tension to the piece. At the end I really didn't think for more than 2 seconds about whether the totem tipped or not. Because it made no difference one way or the other. I was in no way invested in Leo's character.Another disturbing part of the film for me was the notion that even given the damage caused by Leo's character's first use of inception (on his wife) he was perfectly willing to do it again. I found all of the characters morally repugnant and was rooting for them to fail. Problematic as well is the attempt by the film maker to introduce stakes for actions only to immediately blot them out. At one point someone asks Leo if killing the baddies is damaging the psyche of the subject. A simple ""no"" suffices and it is never brought up again. For what reason was it even brought up then?The film also doesn't bear up to scrutiny. The world of Inception didn't play by its own rules and as a result all the wind came out of the film's sails. During the van chase there was tension, if they crash they will be kicked out of the deeper layers. Then the van DOES crash (with lots of rolling/tipping) and this isn't a kick? It took all the tension out of later scenes. Also when the target gets shot, which up to that point was presented as lights out Leo spouts one line of expository dialogue and everything isn't kaput? We aren't very far from Captain Kirk suggesting a tachyon pulse.The most glaring fault, however, was that despite how it was couched in terms of psychology and mental representation, the producers and director clearly had the Sparknotes on Freud and the publishers blurb on Lacan. Even an action-schlock genre film like Avatar had more psychological content than this ""thriller."" Inception is a bloated mass of CGI and MacGuffins with nothing to say and nothing for me to care about.",0
"Disappointed, Oh yes I am Disappointed. Why, Because I had high expectations. Why I had High Expectations? Because Nolan's History of Film making was what I was confident about. Memento, The Dark Knight are the two Movies which got a 10/10 and 9/10 rating from me respectively. But Inception, It was neither Memento, Nor The Dark Knight. It was more of a screenplay forcing you to believe it and to make it look genuine BUT with flawed ways and formulaic techniques which didn't work for me.Other than that it was fine. Visuals, Performances, Editing were all fine and the Camera Used for the movie was not the perfect choice. Direction as usual was POWERFUL but it was the story that didn't really appealed me.It is a movie with fine content but a forcing (in a wrong way) story. 6/10. And I am not crying its over-rated since most of people have really liked it.",0
"First off, it's clear that these IMDb ratings are no longer valid. This film was just 'ok' by anyone's standards, except maybe the plethora of teenagers that love anything that includes lots of gun fire and 'splosions. The plot was unnecessarily convoluted and chock full of lazy writing. I have really liked Chris Nolan's work, so this is not a personal attack on him; it's just nowhere near as slick as others have claimed. The biggest symptoms of lazy writing are: constant exposition in the guise of conversation, constant changing of rules set up earlier in the movie and supposedly brilliant people making illogical choices, when the plot demands it. Many have said that those of us who didn't like it were just clueless and didn't ""get it"". What's to get? The plot was not difficult to understand, just difficult to accept as anything that made any sense. A dream with a dream within a dream. Big effing deal! I bought this film on DVD and couldn't wait to see it as so many people had hailed it as the best thing since Citizen Kane. I was left feeling empty and ripped off, then again, there is an entire generation that claims ""Transformers"" and ""Independence Day"" are two of the best films ever made. I fail to understand how this over-blown, over-hyped film could garner such high ratings unless the people doing the rating have never seen a movie over 20 ears old. The concept was high-minded but the execution was pure popcorn-munching tripe. While I'll admit the cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fairly well done, it was just so empty. As others have pointed out, when it's all just a dream, there's not a lot of tension when faceless people are shooting at you. Just plain silly, I say. (as an aside, South Park did a very funny dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream years ago!)",0
"Very, very overrated film. Worth seeing in the cinema for the visual effects but would never buy the DVD. The acting is good but the content lacks a truly engaging story line. It lures you in but never manages to hook you. They shouldve explored other characters rather than Cobb. It seems to me as though the film could've been pulled off with a less talented supporting cast. Also it is slightly confusing in some parts. Other parts are way too predictable. This is NOT the MIND BLOWING film people talk it up to be. Those people out there who say this is a GREAT film are mistaken. Although in saying that it stills scores a solid 5/10. Cam",0
"It was a pretty good movie, however, when I am able to predict the twists and turns that are going to be taken - and in the first 15 minutes of watching the movie - the movie automatically gets a lower score with me. I cannot count how many of these movies are being made, and most of them are using the same repetitive path - what you think is reality isn't - the one who's in charge - or 'In the know' is the one who's psycho, schizophrenic, or mentally unstable. I was surprised that after Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the same kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept spinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake - which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was a bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that great, and I already can visualize certain types of people making attempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types' you will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and 'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter, etc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a lot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a cult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this movie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an unreality & fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie shows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person starts getting more and more confused about what is real and what isn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit. It's getting a total score of 9??? Up for awards??? Com'on people. There's no logic why this movie is getting these kind of ratings.",0
"Is it just me, or was this unintelligible? Not just 'hacking' into someone's dreams but manipulating their thoughts inside Dreamworld. And then, to add to the confusion, we had dreams within dreams within dreams! If the complex plot had an internal logic which appeared not to defeat Leonardo DiCaprio - it certainly defeated me. There is considerable homage to the MATRIX films, with aerial fights and frozen motion sequences: kid's stuff, but what do kids make of the anarchic storyline? If you die in someone else's dream, you can either wake up alive or go to a place called Limbo (not the same as the one Dante envisaged) which looked like the flooded New York of The Day After Tomorrow a few decades on. The plus side of Limbo for Leo was that it reunited him with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard), but was this his limbo or hers? Best not to ask.If MEMENTO, with time running backwards, was Christopher Nolan's ""set text"" for Filmgoing GCSE, I guess INCEPTION represents A-Level movie comprehension.And I seem to have failed.",0
"Inception is an interesting movie, however I did not enjoy it. I go the movies to be entertained, to be transported into the movie, to be involved and have my emotions stirred. Inception did none of that, it failed because it focused on the creativity but forgot about the audience. Credit must be given to the special effects, the acting and the creative content, but the praise stops there.I have read a lot of the reviews here and I have to say I'm very surprised, I simply don't agree with the high rating this movie has been awarded with. If you would like to watch an interesting, creative and action packed movie, this will not disappoint. For me, there were too many implausible (bordering on ridiculous) twists to enable me to enjoy it. The technical aspects surrounding the connectivity between the participants was just nonsense, there was little explanation, little offered on how it worked and why. Clearly someone thought the audience would just let that part slide and not be too fussed about the technicalities.This is a selfish movie, its been written, produced and directed to be creative, amazing and intelligent.. the problem is someone forgot about the audience. I for one was not engaged, transported nor were my emotions stirred..apart from feeling annoyed and disappointed.I expected so much more from this movie..",0
"I sat in disbelief while watching this movie and when it had finnally finnished i registered to IMDb to slate this mess of a movie.i really cant be bothered going into the whole story etc because i'll be here all day.the main downfall of this movie is the Robert Fischer character,his subconscious was trying to defend the so called inception and what did he do? well he just imagined a few soldiers and a train to annoy dicaprio and the rest of the get along gang. BORING!!!! surely his mind could have thought of a few monsters or flying turds or anything other than what goes in normal every day life i mean it was meant to be a dream and uurrrgghhh i cant be arsed going on any more . why was there no drama or excitement to this film? why was this movie not like a dream at all? why did i actually sit thru this movie? why why why? Christopher Nolan and dicaprio i want my 148 minutes of wasted time back",0
"At the end of the movie I was really surprised that someone actually stole the whole plot from ""Paprika"", an anime released in 2006.Nolan shamelessly took story, characters and even scenes from Paprika - which goes way beyond ""inspiration"". Go search for Paprika on the net for yourself.For the dialogues and directing: The first hour was just awful. That old shoe Leonardo and some other soulless characters talking and talking and talking. I just wanted to stand up and shout: SHUT UP AND GIMME A REASON TO WATCH!And after noticing the whole idea was stolen, I really had a hard time not to leave. But I gave it a shot.Nothing changed, three scenes switching all the time: falling car, dude fighting in hotel, a group of Chuck Norrisses fighting in snow. And that for an hour. Whee whee special effects! OK, but special effects should be the cherry on the delicious ice cream, not the ice cream itself.Do yourself a favor and save your time and money. Unless you are into quickly changing scenes and super-mystical-pseudo-deepness with a bullshit ending (which are a lot of people).",0
"People must have gone insane!!! I usually don't give my opinion in blogs, forums etc. because it makes me feel like a dog barking in the dark at unknown strangers. And I don't like this registration forms and surveys and other marketing bullshit tools that sites like this are using. But... this film and its absurd rating provoked me so much that I had to brake my principles. I have seen A LOT of movies. Thousands of movies. And I(please forgive my lack of modesty)consider my self an intelligent person. At least a little bit over the average level. And I am mad at this movie and at the 99% of all these people that with their votes made me believe that this movie deserves 148 minutes of my life. No it doesn't deserve even these 50 which I generously gave it... Despite of all its ""layers"", special effects, computer graphics and multimillion dollar budget, this movie is simply a flat, pointless, boring and not even entertaining bullshit. It insults me, because it's made for elementary school kids, uses their language, verbally explains every step like in the mute films of the twenties, and pretends to be a high class entertainment for smart people. Yesterday I watched 4 or 5 European and South American movies. None of them had budget higher than 15 million dollars. Inception doesn't worth even a tenth of the worst of them with its 160 million dollar budget. Apart from the special effects I don't see anything good in it. Acting is bad, dialogue is worse, and entertainment is zero. I was actually forcing myself watching and waiting to see the point of all this... Couldn't bear anymore when my watch showed that 50 minutes have passed. And I love Science Fiction movies. I even from time to time enjoy watching a B rate movies, which make you relax and give you 2 hours of entertainment away from everyday stress. This one just made me checking my watch every 2 minutes to see when it would finally end... Basta!!!Don't waste your time and money!",0
"Guys, don't waste your money. This is just a lousy remake of Tarkovsky ""Solaris"" with modern entourage made in Hollywood, camouflaged with some new lines without a philosophical background with some extra bang-bang for the young generation. It's impossible for a youth to understand serious movie and this action-decorated replica probably helps them to see the original masterpiece. Actually, actors' performances are not very strong either, only Marion Cotillard tried to set an equality with her Academy Award prize. FX are interesting, but probably it's the only strong point in the whole film. It's very sad, that Hollywood completely run out of good scripts and this is their last idea how to attract people to a cinema.",0
"The title pretty much sums the movie up. An absolutely amazing cast and incredible premise was almost wholly pushed to the margin by special effects and ""action"". My hopes were too high. Nolan was clearly out of his depth as far as intellect goes and totally blew the chance to pull off an epic, unprecedented dream heist flick.Dear Nolan, if you're reading this: You can give guns, grenade launchers and C4 to a cast of unknown actors, place them virtually anywhere and have them destroy everything in sight for two hours, and it would have been just as good as this movie.Thanks for ripping me off by luring me in with an allure that promised slick corporate spies engaged in mind games in surreal settings and instead taking it from a promising half-way point into a senseless visceral joyride that was quite literally the cinematic equivalent of van Gogh painting Starry Night then taking a bowie to it and slashing it to ribbons before the paint has a chance to dry.It's painfully clear that you wrote the script to allow you to stroke your ego with the most over-the-top action flick you could cook up. With the money you spent on all the great actors you employed for this, you could have hired a dozen great writers to develop a script that would have actually been worthy of their talent. You sir, simply WASTED it. I actually feel embarrassed for Michael Caine. That such a fine actor was dragged into this crap is sad. You could have just flashed a still photograph of his face for a few frames and it would have sufficed since you don't pause for even a second to develop ANY of the characters except for Cobb and anyone with half a brain was probably wondering WHY character development was so scant in a film that deals so heavily with the subconscious mind. No, I guess a car chase was more important. It's entirely beyond me why you tainted your ego-stroking action flick with a genuinely thought-provoking premise when all the ""smart parts"" flew over the heads of your target audience by a wide berth.tl;dr version: shallow, pseudointellectualist excuse for making an obscene, self-gratifying action flick. I hope to god you get your money's worth if you actually pay to see this garbage.",0
"I mean that figuratively and literally. First because this film doesn't deserve being that much praised (#3 best movie??!! - Matrix was way better, for example), second because, just as the unwatchable The Dark Knight, Nolan loves to have his movie filled with irritatingly loud rumbling noise throughout, even in romantic/dramatic scenes! Why? Is that to cover up the lack of real cinematic value and sustain the artificial climax? Over such a long movie, you wanna kill yourself!Wait for the DVD/BluRay if only for the CG effects. Cause there's little else than that really. Probably the last time I go out to the movies.",0
"The fact that 37,000+ persons voted this silly movie a ""10"" is either ""studio feed"" or proof as to why our country has gone to the dogs these past 18 months.The movie lasts 2 1/2 hours but the plot can be told in one sentence: A man seeks to reconcile to the memory of his dead wife. What we get is over two hours of pointless explosions, false and silly action scenes including having a freight train plunge down a city street. There are a few human interactions, but these don't much matter. All this is underlined by the unoriginal use of loud and intense background music (heavy on drums) giving the erroneous impression that something important is happening. Environmentalists (the real ones, not the lefty nit-wits) might be annoyed that Lloyd drops hundreds of millions of tons of collapsed buildings debris into the ocean -- for no better reason than a brat destroying a sand castle.As for the dream scenes: Wes Craven simply owns this with his brilliant ""Nightmare on Elm Sreet."" Craven obviously had first hand personal torment and he understood nightmares, whereas Christopher Nolan might have never been asleep, for all he knows.The few good points were DeCaprio, Ellen Page, Michael Caine, and a few good international locales.On second thought I doubt there were 37,000 nit-wits who loved this movie. The pattern is familiar. A well-hyped Warner Brothers movie starts getting 10-ratings from the first minute. Studios have been purchasing rave reviews from media critics for decades, surely they's continue doing so and corrupt this website. IMDb has no controls to prevent fraud. There was no trace of enthusiasm among the crowd tonight, just a dazed look of What Was That?",0
"Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' often gets a mention in many 'best films of all time' lists, despite the fact that this is probably one of the least rewarding and most pointless films I've ever watched.It spends the whole of its bloated two-and-a-half hour running length trying to prove how intellectually superior it is, yet requires the characters to spell out virtually every development of the ridiculously messy and convoluted plot.An intentionally complex and non-linear storyline is not smart, but pretentious filmmaking. What exactly is the point in such a bewildering minefield of a plot in which the ending presents more questions than the start? The only reason I can think of is to satisfy the ego of those who like to think of themselves as smarter than they actually are.'Inception' is one of the most overhyped, overrated and pretentious films I've ever seen.",0
I am really baffled by all the positive reviews for this film. This film was one of the hardest watches I have had in the cinema. I'm very patient with films but this one gave me a sore head. The script was a mess and worst of all it was very boring!,0
"Good news is I got to see it for free on an HBO free weekend and did not have to pay to see it.Bad news, I got to see the movie.I was really looking forward to this movie. The trailers were great and the concept was intriguing. The problem was the execution. Once again, chase scenes, fights, explosions, special effects etc took the place of good writing. What could have been a cerebral movie just turned out to be another action movie. I do not want to take anything away from the special effects, they were very good and some were outstanding. My problem was that maybe there was only 30 minutes of actual plot and dialog in the entire movie. After a while, you quit wondering if it is real or a dream and just start dreaming that the movie will end soon. There are really no good twists and turns in the movie and little that is so thought provoking that you want to talk about the movie afterwords.My advice would be to take the special effects budget and spend it on some great writers.As the old commercial asked ""Is it real or is it Memorex?"" Who cares?",0
"I had waited to see this movie on a decent copy DVD and missed it at the cinema. It was a very hyped movie on its release and I like De Caprios movies on the whole including the recent Shutter Island which surely does have some psychological connection with this movie in'playing with our minds'. But I liked and followed Shutter Island, I couldn't really follow 'Inception' and as a native Englishman, I am still unsure as to the meaning of the word 'Inception' for the context of the film.The film is only mildly engaging, tries to be intelligent and smart but fails dismally. There is no lack of action but this is 'not' Bourne Supremacy' or 'Salt' and things happened so haphazardly and quickly in the actions scenes that it completely bored the pants off me when watching the movie because I was trying to follow the story of the film and couldn't, so I became frustrated.Leonardo is a great actor and acts well, true enough and I love Ellen Page after Juno and even Peacock - but this film was definitely not for her and Michael Caine had a minor cameo role as Miles the Father figure for Leonardos character. As for Mal played by Marion Couthillard, oh dear, what a shambles! This is one of those films which will be quickly forgotten and barely remembered in Leonardos repertoire. The concept of the film is indeed a good and innovative one and I kept thinking of movies like 'The Matrix' while watching it. Why oh why did the director have to 'overcook' this movie.We watch movies to be entertained. Like Iron Man 2, if you like movies with abundant action and little reality, go ahead, watch this movie and rave about it but for me, it is a major disappointment, not with the mainstream acting and the story but with the end result through directing and production. My feeling is that it was shoddy.Not a movie to review a second time or recommend to friends to see, sorry!",0
"The only moments that had dream-like qualities in the movie were the times I dozed off & my own dreams (many times more imaginative I might add) took over. To be blunt about it, Inception is not so much about dreams as about the world of video games. Even more telling than the gratuitous CGI effects was the clunky narrative device of having the characters explain in overly verbose dialog where & when each segment was taking place (levels, locations, psychological motivations, etc.). Like having to follow instructions of a poorly designed game. Ugh. The popularity of this snoozer is very sad testimony to the mediocrity of the average movie-going intelligence.",0
"I cannot believe people have voted this movie 9.0. I never critique a movie just because it does not make sense, I love quite a few extremely stupid b-movies which are far from making any sense. In my opinion, a movie can make no sense all right, provided it is still entertaining. However, this one does happen to make so little sense that it should be classified as fantasy, not sci-fi, as explained in detail in many ""Hated It"" comments here. And as for entertainment, Inception, a movie about dreams, ironically made me so sleepy I barely made it to the end.Basically most ""Loved It"" comments here posit this movie to be pure ""genius"" because it is so ""complex"" and ""multi-layered"". If you don't like it, you must be too stupid to understand all the supposedly mesmerizing, breathtaking and complex ""layers"" or ""levels"". In short, an idea that one can dream within a dream either ""blows your mind"" or you are stupid. Well, okay, maybe it's just me. I happen to have been reading sci-fi since my early childhood, plus virtually all the software code I write actually represent a complex and multi-layered virtual reality, so I'm personally not that impressed. Looks like the ""Loved It"" guys were truly ""mesmerized"" by the dream-within-a-dream idea though, must have been quite an intellectual shock for them. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with it, only that it's not necessarily a ""genius"" in 2010. I would probably be ""mesmerized"" if I watched Nolan's movie in, say, 1910 (or to be on the safe side, in 1810).The worst was the casting, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page are good actors, but their cute & cuddly faces in a supposedly dark and moody sci-fi movie? No credibility at all, that completely threw me off. That choice would be perfect if Nolan was at least shooting for so-bad-it's-good movie. As a result, Inception is so-average-it-makes-you-sleepy movie.",0
"This movie is completely overrated. Just because they's going into people's dreams does not make this film intelligent, and it does not compensate for the bad plot and underdeveloped characters. I found myself just wanting it to be over an hour into it. I had no problem understanding the concept, i just thought it was nothing exceptional. Let's not only enter one dream but enter three! It was completely ridiculous. I realize that it was a movie and they don't necessarily have to be realistic but i think the idea to enter three dreams was just a sad attempt to make the movie have more depth and fake complexity. This film easily could have been shortened down if it didn't have the unnecessary dragged out gun fights. When ever a new gun fight came up i would grown knowing i'd have to sit and watch it for another twenty minutes or so. They never developed the characters to make you feel bad for them if they died or got hurt. I even thought while watching how much i wouldn't care if they got stuck in the dream forever and went into limbo or whatever, as long as it ends soon and i can leave! I would never have thought that if they would have made the characters relatable and not so indulgent. The movie itself took itself a little too seriously also. I got a vibe the whole time just with the over dramatic music and over the top effects that the people who made it obviously thought too highly of it which i never find appealing. The only reason i give this movie any stars at all is for the cinematography and acting. Otherwise this movie is just an overrated indulgent film that is just pitiful attempt to call a 9/10 star movie. Pathetic.",0
"This overly-hyped movie tried to be too clever by half and didn't even manage to pull off a Matrix-type pretentiousness. It's just bad, substituting elementary (and wrong) psychobabble for plot. It's science fiction and fantasy, it doesn't have to conform to real life but it should conform to its own rules. The acting was wooden, which is due to the bad script because each of these actors can hold their own elsewhere. The pacing is glacial. We are continually being preached at about the subconscious, but it's all like an Agatha Christie novel, with a surprise, unforeseen and unannounced deus ex machina just popping up here and there to wrap things up. Like, it's really complicated because there are these things called ""levels"" to dreaming and the subconscious. If the director spent ten years writing this script, he should get another job. It looks like it was pasted together in a couple of days over a few too many mai-tais. Some interesting visuals, but that's all there is.",0
"Inception is, simply, overrated. It defies the long standing approach of show don't tell; of course it must tell, otherwise, the viewer would be even more lost. And of course, when it comes to action, it is all show just like any good action movie. In fact, Inception is nothing but an action movie wrapped in some philosophical stuff about dreams. There is, of course, real ingenuity in some of the action scenes especially those place in a zero gravity situation. Nolan was simply lucky in having an action movie released during a time when there wasn't really much competition and audiences were clearly hungry for something better. Nolan was even luckier having Hans Zimmer for Mr. Zimmer keeps suspense alive during the many long scenes of exposition. The real theatrical breakthrough lies in the film's using the telling part (hugely aided by Hans' music) to sustain interest and some suspense which are then fulfilled in the showing part. It is quite amazing that the film did so well at the BO; there are really no characters to sympathize with or to particularly care about. As to plot, the payoff for the many pangs of Cobb's conscience is indeed worthwhile. While many seem to think the film will have considerable longevity, it will fade quite quickly when considered outside of its lucky time slot.",0
"I am fascinated by the range of opinions people have about this film and I am astonished that people have rated it highly. Some people have even suggested this is one of the top 5 films of all time. Bizarre.What Inception really reminded me of was the Emporer's New Clothes. If enough people say something is great a lot of others are likely to be swept along by the idea, frightened to go against popular opinion. Well I'm glad that a lot of people have been honest enough to say that this film is not half as good as the marketing department would have us believe.The latest I heard from the pluggers was the film has to be seen more than once to appreciate it. Ha! Good try guys but I can't imagine anyone being prepared to give this another try.The script made no sense and the characters were unbelievable. Worst of all, I felt no attachment for any of the characters and did not care what happened to them.In my opinion, this is a meaningless, uninspired waste of time. Unoriginal idea, weak script, insipid acting, plot and logic holes galore do not add up to a blockbuster. The film gets 4 marks for the impressive CGI but loses 2 of those for the derivative James Bond sequence.The lady to my left spent the last two hours sound asleep. I was very jealous of her.",0
"Everyone has been telling me how this movie is so complex, so confusing. That you really need to pay attention or you'll get lost.I dosed off in the middle and still knew exactly what was happening.This movie is nothing but a cross between The Matix, Dreamscape, Mission Impossible and about 3 other movies and anime films that have been coming out since the mid 1980's. The ending was the most obvious outcome it could be, you already know he doesn't except the dream version of his wife so she would be gone. But the kids?getting home to see their faces again, they were the real focus. If you missed that in the beginning then seeing his father-in-law pick him up at the airport should have been the final tip off.Most people I ask about that missed it all; they couldn't even tell which dream was which. I think that's what scares me the most, people think this takes real intelligence to follow.Maybe if your attention deficit?Oh wait I am and I still had no trouble following this over rated boring movie.I gave this movie 4 out of 10 stars for special effects only, for story line and acting I give it only 2 stars",0
"Over the top special effects movie that overshadow the plot and interesting concept. Actually a very very simple plot. Visually excellent, if you are impressed with studio effects that you see in so many action movies. I guess.Simple plot line but complicated presentation that left me lost twice lost until about 10 minutes later. Then, ""I got it."" After one or two of those you get the hang of it. This is how the movie is structured _ they tell you and then reinforce. Kindergarten for adults. It is all very clear but you have to pay attention The problem is the action scenes are over the top. How many snow chases have you seen? There are bad guys that can't shoot and good guys who seem to be wimps that beat the heck out of the soldiers and thugs. This isn't real life. How many times do we need to watch the fight scene in the hotel hallway? Why do they go on and on? Boy is this tedious! There is a lot of time and special effects used for a simple plot line.It's a ying and yang movie. I guess I would call it a cognition or attribution movie coupled with overly done, seen it before shoot it up scenes used to present what were interesting concepts. It is simple action movie and I think it could have been a thinker's movie.",0
"Not much more to add really. I managed to watch this farce for about half an hour, I desperately wanted to give it a chance, but every passing minute is such an insult to my intelligence that I cannot carry on. Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it's not fair to rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I'm not a masochist.This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film.This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But it lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDb. However, my rating of 2 is not because I want to bring the total down, it is rather what I think the realistic rating is. And that 2 is a very generous score.",0
"Damn this film rates high on IMDb, but I am not one for ratings. I think a great film is like food, we have all different taste, and this did not taste well for me. Sure it's glossy, great special effects, great cast. But this film is all over the place, just to many angle's with in an angle. Leonardo has made some great films, but after Shutter Island I became less of a fan. I rate Shutter Island only slightly better, but both are a let down for me. I am sure lots of people will dislike my take on this over hyped film, what kills the story for me, it has all these different layers inside layers, sure the idea is O.K but it is not very well done in this film, just one big mess of special effects, that leaves me just feeling very flat. I gave it a 3 out of 10, as visually it is pleasing.",0
"For a film of this kind to work there are (at the very least) three script-writing requirements: a) internal logic, b) characters with depth, and c) the complete omission of wise-a*s gimmickry.The film fails on all three counts.I liked the avalanche; I liked the freight train. I laughed at the Kubrick tributes. Beyond that, the thing was too simple for words - but dressed up to be a deep and meaningful experience. You know you are watching a loser when an elevator takes you up and down the guy's consciousness. An elevator? Now who dreamed that up?World domination? A Japanese accent that is unintelligible? Cartoonish characters of all shades (to sell tickets?) Two female leads, one of whom is frighteningly out of whack with the film's storyline (she doesn't understand anything, but is designing the project!), and the other wandering through scenes meant to be scary but - hey, you need to be able to act first, and it would help to then act scary.This film is a mess - except for the avalanche and freight train.",0
"I have just read some of the bad reviews on Inception ,and I have to say that I totally agree with them.This movie is absolutely overrated,it's humorless,pretentious,overlong,underacted,repetitive....But for me,the worst thing is that it's a strange case of a boring heist movie (strange because heist movies are generally entertaining ones).Considering that,apparently in dreams,everything is so much complicated hadn't it been much easier doing it for real ? I think the real INCEPTION the movie is referring to,is the idea that this movie is actually good. May be I was not dreaming that day !!!",0
"Watch out - the amount of intelligent scriptwriting you accredit this funny movie with may be surprisingly linear to the lack of simple scientific knowledge and common sense you might possess!I simply CAN NOT believe that this movie has a 9.1 rating on IMDb. It makes me question a) the people or b) people who take time to write reviews. This is actually my first comment here and its catalyzed by the imposing will to set one thing straight: It is an absolutely average Hollywood flick and the first that made me question Leo's decision. I became a fan of this excellent acting in the recent years but it was actually painful to listen to the randomly pulled together pseudo-scientific plot. If you know anything about what they try to make up you will start laughing or continue to watch and hope for the good stuff to start. The action was good and the movie definitely has it's moments but I couldn't ""enjoy"" it until the last hour.Watch it if you can be easily pursued into a poorly presented idea, believe it and be drawn into it. And there seems to be nothing else worth watching right now - unless you check some aspiring independent movies.Don't watch it if you like sci-fi that is believable and passionate. This one is one lame attempt -or just a blown up money grab. As overrated as Batman.",0
"L.Di Caprio would just need to realize there was no reason for him not to go to USA over to his kids, because he didn't kill the woman in the first place and he was just imagining people thought he did or that police was after him or not letting him into the country. must be a very good father to help one multi-corporation boss take over other guys business in order to go back to kids, he could have visited anyway if someone would have made him clear he is just a little bit retarded. oh gosh, and this Japanese guy (since he can just like that buy an airport etc.) could have also payed to kill this son of the other boss or whatever. stupid enough, this Japanese multimillionaire even motivates this young guy to make his own business. i mean, the guy can buy airport and he still wants more. why is the so called best architecture student in Paris even interested in working with these retarded people? money? and the other two guys.. i guess they are just tired to live in that Aladin-looking street in Mombasa drinking magical potions. what a bunch of losers. maybe the movie is trying to say, non of this movie makes sense in any way, because it is all happening in this limbo. if this is directors limbo, i understand why he added this annoying suspense soundtrack, three special effect and 400 guys with guns running around like someone would have filled their heads with air. i guess air in the most audiences heads is the only thing holding this movie from drowning.i try to lean back on my chair, to wake up from this reality, where a crap movie like that can get movie prizes and people actually find it intelligent. this plot is something that a 14 years old kid with a bit of imagination could have written. i really don't understand how something that shallow and idiotic can make so much money and get so many attention. no wonder we live in a world that often feels as idiotic as this movie.you call a crazy guy coming home to his kids after this obviously unsuccessful helping-a-big-company-to-gain-monopole therapy a happy and? it is just incredible what kind of rubbish people actually buy. it is very sad.",0
"This film should have been awarded a Razzie for having the worst plot, that is if such an award exists. The plot was immensely difficult to follow. I remember reading one of a free cinema magazines while watching it at the cinema. The plot is in a dream, that is in another dream that is in a dream while he is dreaming, or something along those lines. For the first half an hour or so I was engaged with the film's plot. Who wouldn't be interested in the idea that Nolan was playing with? But he took his ideas too far in the case of 'Inception.' The whole thing just became ridiculous. The bizarre plot had an effect on the other aspects of the film. The otherwise brilliant action scenes became surprisingly dull. As I often had little idea of what was going on, to me the action scenes just seemed pointless as I did not know what the characters motives were.Despite this, the action scenes and the cinematography did offer a real spectacle.Again, one of the positives was that the acting was, admittedly of a good quality. DiCaprio, Page, Caine and Postlewaite all had good performances. But is was such a shame that I was not able to follow the development of the characters because of the plot.Overall, if you enjoy a mind-boggling plot then 'Inception' will be for you. If you want a film that you will enjoy from start to finish without having to get into it, 'Inception' will not be for you.",0
"For the amount of effort that went into this production, I found the result to be ultimately pretty dull. Like nearly 99% of what has come out of Hollywood in the past 15 years or so, this film has loads of technique but little heart. It offers little to care for, and therefore little to remember.Yes, there's some fancy graphics, but that's about it. The internal logic of the nested dreams is routinely disrupted, the action sequences don't make much sense (why all the shooting, really?) and none of the characters are emotionally involving. Di Caprio's character has a nominal story arc at best, and the angst he's supposed to feel is not grounded because we don't know neither his nor his wife's history, or how they got together.Yes, Inception is a fun mind game. But like most mind games, it ultimately doesn't make for a worthwhile experience. And at 2.5 hours this mind game is far too overblown. Its lack of proportion (too much talk, too many levels, too much trivial action, complicated for the sake of complicated) unfortunately makes things worse. The incessant music, typical of Zimmer, is trivially repetitive, as are much of the action sequences. Ultimately these become much more intrusive and annoying as the film progressives.When I compare this film to older ones, like The Woman in the Window, which achieves so much more of a memorable experience and story, yet with so little, one has to wonder if technology and truckloads of cash are getting in the way of memorable storytelling.This film would have fared much better as a comedy, or maybe as round-table discussion about dreams, or maybe as a survey of a Facebook clique of friends sharing dreams. But the film needed to have far more fantasy to really evoke the sensation of dreamscapes. And most importantly, it needed a far more soulful and compelling story with characters we are allowed to learn about and therefore care about.",0
"dream in a dream in a dream = existenz planting an idea = what do you mean planting an idea is original . i can list bigger ideas other movies plant . THE MATRIX 1999 = planting the idea into everyone making them believe they are in reality . TOTAL RECALL 1990 = a false 2 week vacation memory has been planted in ARNOLD. and for you guys that says dreams and virtual reality is different. wrong . what is presented in inception is a dream that looks like reality . a place that is constructed for the subject to feel real. if you wanna see a dream then watch paprika or the holy mountain . a ""dream that is constructed to feel real"" and a ""virtual reality"" IS basically the SAME . so what is new in inception ? NOTHING . just some cool looking characters does not make a film good .",0
"OK here goes. I'll prepare myself for an ass kicking.I finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me!!?? Does this film really deserve 9.1 out of 10??? (1st sept 2010).I found this film incredibly frustrating. So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on. Nice idea. Very interesting. So why take over 2hrs to get to the point!!?? I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end - not feeling that i'd missed anything important.I didn't really like the characters. In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didn't feel it here at all.So some of you like the FX?? Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer. The one they sold the film on.Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and predictable. They do that a lot in this film.So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they don't understand the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn't like it. I certainly don't think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that. Clever, visually brilliant AND enjoyable.",0
"Let me start by saying that this movie would have been good had I not seen Shutter Island or read ""I am the Cheese"". Inception is nothing more then Shutter Island meets the Matrix. The motive and the plot are the same in both Shutter Island and Inception. SPOILER DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.Both of DiCaprio's characters in these films both blame them selves for the death of their wives, they spend the movie creating a world where they do not have to live with the guilt of their loss. I know you are reading this and thinking ""But a lot of movies have wives as the root of the characters problems"" and your right so let me go further. In both movies DiCaprio also has issues with his children, in one they are dead and in the other he is unable to see them.Now if that isn't enough here is the mini cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the Sunday of recycled garbage that is this film. In both movies he blames a single selfish action of his own doing for the reason of his wife's death. This is why he creates these worlds to live in to hide the truth from him self.On a positive note the effects of this movie were awesome. Some of the best I have seen in a long time I enjoy seeing Hollywood try something new rather then overload their films with CGI. Other than that I have nothing positive to say about this film.I end this by saying watch either Shutter Island or Inception, either film on their own was OK but when you watch one after the other all you can do is think ""Man why is Leo playing the same roll again, he has depth he is much better then this"". Also Nolan go out and find a good script and stop piggy backing off of other films.",0
"Having seen this 24 hours ago the more I think about it the more I think this is over-hyped and actually a rather poor movie. On leaving the cinema I was prepared to give it a 7 (well short of it's 9.3 on IMDb) but on reflection I'm downgrading it to a 5.5.Why? For a start the writing is ridiculously weak. The plot, although slightly intriguing in that you do make the effort to keep up with the triple (or is it quadruple) levels of depth, is preposterous. In short it's about a dream within a dream within a dream. I think that's correct! But, that said, who cares? It might be crafty but it isn't crafted. It's self indulgent in the extreme.Whilst not gratuitously violent, there are a lot of killings in this film, but the ""goodies"" are dead eye dicks to a man (and woman) whilst the ""baddies"" are way, way beyond inept. With five targets and two and a half hours of incessant shooting I counted only 2 direct hits, whereas the ""baddies"" must have taken in excess of 200 fatalities. Just plain silly really.Then there's the casting. Di Caprio is starting to look desperate for a decent acting part and Ellen Page absolutely sucks compared to her magnificent role in Juno (it's the writing I tell ya).The special effects are at times good, on one or two occasions I'd call them remarkable, but not on many. As an emotional engagement exercise it has all the impact of a potato. I've been more moved by a night in watching Blomberg TV.Christopher Nolan is just not that great a director or writer on this occasion.Sorry folks.(His mind was the scene of a crime.)",0
"What a let down. Due to the hype and exuberant reviews I had expected something akin to Eternal Sunshine or at least something not totally unlike The Matrix. Instead we get something like 'the Cell' without the lush imagery, but with plot holes so big that even Jorge Garcia would drop through them. So what is it that makes this film so mediocre. 1. The shoot outs and action scenes. Seriously, I've seen better in James Bond films from the early eighties, even if you deem this to be impossible. But what makes those scenes so utterly annoying is that there is no purpose to them whatsoever other than to appeal to people who like to see things go 'bang' and no doubt play first-person shooters in their bedrooms. Those guns don't propel the story forward a single inch.2. The cast. Nothing happens between Leonardo and Marion. There is no spark, no chemistry, thus you can't really understand why Leonardo would consider staying in a dreamworld just to be together with his old flame that he doesn't seem to have any affection for when she was alive.3. The Alibi cutie. If you eliminate Allen Page from the script, no-one would spot the difference. Honestly folks, if the architect of a dream landscape is so important and the wrong fabric of a bathmat can thwart the success of a mission, why don't we get any insight of how this whizz kid designs those dreamscapes and what makes her so indispensable. If we had any inkling what exactly she was doing there apart from looking pretty she would have been far less annoying.4. The aforementioned holes in the plot. Too numerous to mention here, just think about this: if someone who has a dream in a dream and in the first dream he sits in a van that drops down a bridge, there is no logical way he would be weightless in the second dream cause physically he doesn't sit in the van and mentally he doesn't know about the moments without gravity. Dreams just don't work like that and it is an insult to peoples intelligence to suggest that they do.But if all that was not enough, there is so much more inconsistency here, like for instance, why would a tycoon who has the money to buy up entire airlines and the power to overrule the judicial system in America be so utterly afraid of some healthy competition that he risks being lost in his dreamworld for more than thirty years? I think 'good clean fun-loving popcorn movie' is just an euphemism for brainless mainstream crap from America but what is even worse is brainless mainstream crap that claims to be sophisticated. This film certainly is not.",0
"Inception is a sign of the times.It is the Google-Twitter-FourSquare-iPhone apps version of a movie.It is a smart idea. It is an idea that manipulates and seduces the masses. It is all about the execution. But ultimately, it is an idea with no heart.It's hard to care for the premise. In these days of BP, do we really care for an energy company vs another energy company? It's even harder to care for the characters. There isn't a Danny Oceanesque easy charm when the team is assembled. There is no single character in the team who we can gravitate towards. And the whole longing father routine doesn't really work.At least The Matrix (first movie) had a heartfelt resolution - that love is the answer. Inception...it's just cold. Clever, but cold.Gimme Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with its tech-with-human-touch idea of pitting memories against the power of love anytime.",0
"Inception: pointless mix . Nolan: absolutely _overrated_. DiCaprio: same chewed gum. Conclusion: I want my money back.This is just utter bullshit really. And for sure nothing to be 9.2 ... people should go back and see again real movies..please. Want a real inception? Fightclub, Matrix 1, and many others. But this one? I can hear DiCaprio crying on the phone ' I want to be like Keanu, pleaseeeee', so they put together this script in like what, couple of weekends? and they get Nolan... the most overrated director ever... the result speaks for itself... a pointless mix...at 3/4 of the movie ppl where leaving the theater... dullness empire... bah.",0
"I watched it with five friends last night and other then one girl, no one liked the movie. The potential is there but it was missed somehow... There were more bullets flying in this movie, then six season of the A-team combined! It didn't really matter what was going on, all of a sudden you had people shooting all over the place, then they would stop and then the would shoot again.. shooting, shooting and shooting.. Hey, if I wanted to see a war movie I would have rented Rambo instead!I don't understand what's the big fuss about this movie. The plot is weak, the ending is Meh and the movie is way too long. The idea is very nice but the writers tried to turn it into a big Action/Drama/Thriller and they failed three times!A few cool effects but that's about it.. two thumbs down!",0
"i really do not understand that how people say it is a masterpiece it is a piece of faeces... plagiarism from matrix.. the high rates are just about some fans of mr Leonardo dicaprio? yes of course the wet girls who like him vote 10 always..they don't watch the film, they watch their potential dream boy..the film is really very boring and i couldn't wait until it finished and i think the points will be in a decreasing line in future..worthless film waste of time..and it is an insult to the films really deserve high points..the perception of reality is the same in matrix and this must be discussed by the people who watched this film.this is about money and advertisement of such Hollywood films they have the ability to show a bad film as a good one..",0
"Another phenomenally over-hyped blockbuster from Nolan, which - like all his movies - is nothing else but a pseudo-clever, emotionally cold and pompous high gloss product that's masquerading as intelligent mainstream entertainment.It's such fun to watch all the movie geeks and oh-so literate critics (and almost everyone in between) fall for well-packaged, but thoroughly trivial nonsense like this with such aplomb. It's as if all the stupid action movies and (romantic) comedies Hollywood is churning out regularly have led to a yearning for something more profound... though the big guns and larger-than-life stars are still not to be missed, of course.This one's in the same league as ""Matrix"", though much more elaborate in its twisted ways. (Just listen to the constantly exchanged plot explanations between the characters, which get unintentionally funny after a while.) One watches pics like these applauding the makers, without investing deeper thoughts or emotions. One's much too puzzled to feel anything.By the way, this must've been the longest showdown I've ever seen in any movie. Afterwards, I felt like that ancient Asian guy.5 out of 10 ever-whirling roundabouts",0
"This movie was terrible. It tried to be something ground breaking and emotionally challenging, but fell terribly short on all fronts, starting with the basic premise. I am expected to believe that a group of people smart enough to construct an elaborate plot involving breaking into other people's dreams are not smart enough to reunite a man with his family without getting stopped at customs? That's stupid. Fly to Mexico and walk. Or fly the kids to you. This giant plot hole is unfathomably stupid, as is most of the dialogue in this two and a half hour nightmare. I think my personal favorite line in the movie was when DiCaprio's character told his dream wife that he could not do her justice because he could not remember all of her perfections and all of her imperfections. You can't have both stupid. This movie is probably mindblowingly deep and meaningful if your education stopped in grade school, but if you have a least a GED, don't waste your ten bucks.",0
I must admit I was really looking forward to this film but as with most of the big blockbusters in recent years it was a rather overrated experience. A good cast and some good acting but an overly complicated script and convoluted way of going about stuff using ideas from a lot of decent films that have gone before. The argument that if you don't like it you are too dumb to understand it does not wash as it's easy enough to understand what's going on but why it's going on does not make that much sense. One example is that for no sensible reason Leo is involved in a domestic situation that results in his wife's death and now seems to be worldwide public enemy number one?We have the usual assembling of an elite team to go in and carry out the usual impossible mission with consequences that are unknown to most of the team members that will impact on their success or not. Well that's original.Chucking sci-fi babble into a story does not always enhance the story and most of the inception idea tech talk is boring and nonsensical.The 'shock' ending is predictable and has been signposted since pretty much the start of the film which was overlong and overcomplicated and not at all as intelligent as it was made out to be. Like Shutter Island Leo is once again involved in a film that promises a lot but delivers not a great deal. Some spectacular sets and nice effects cannot cover up an ordinary fun bit of sci-fi nonsense passed off as genius. Like Avatar before it thinking it is some kind of genre changing piece of film when its just a half decent bit of entertainment that will linger with an audience until they get to the car park of KFC.Thought provoking cinema seems destined to be left behind for this kind of multi layered pseudo sci-fi babble which looks pretty but is not as clever as it likes to think.,0
"The reviews that call this ""genius"" are just ridiculous. The plot was so overwhelmingly incredulous that even the most open minded movie goer would find this plain brain dead.I love the long mundane reviews of this ""work of art""/""masterpiece"". How much were you fools paid to write such garbage.Half through my son summed it up best when he asked ""dad, is it almost done yet?"" Enough said.3 thumbs down from our group and 8 thumbs down from co-workers.Odd, my own little cross section severely diverges from the reviews in IMDb......hmmmm..",0
"NOTE: Nolan fanboys are going to hate my review, don't even bother to send me PM's saying ""U SUCK, YOUR TASTE SUX"". Don't even bother to report this review hoping that someone will delete it, it will prove that fanboys are a bunch of keyboard warriors trying to ""deffend"" everything in the most ridiculous way.Everyone is saying that this is the best movie of the year and saying that ""it looks like an Alfred Hitchcok movie""....it doesn't even come close from the masterpieces of Hitchcok ! Everyone gave this movie a 10 star rating even if they didn't saw it, because it was from the director of The Dark Knight (another disappointment, but less painful than this piece of crap), the audience are a bunch of sheeps.The story is predictable, the twists are predictable, the action scenes sucks, they sucked so much that i almost missed the ""action"" sequence of the Transformers movies (the live action ones).Why i give this movie a 2 stars ? one star for the cast and another one for the musical score.UPDATE: i had the misfortune to rewatch this piece of crap and my vote is 1, truly awful.",0
"As an American Indian i was raised, unlike modern people, with a deep ceremonial experience with dreaming. Every idea in modern society seems to diminish the natural ability of people to dream and to remember what they dream. A film like this exploits the natural interest people have in dreams to tell an impossible story. As entertainment it is passable, even interesting...as information on dreaming it is not only worthless, it takes the mind away from any hope of effective dreaming. This is the toxic nature of the film-making experience, where we see reality in such a skewed and unreliable way that we no longer understand reality. Human society has surrendered its powers to dream to the church, to the university, to the corporate paymaster and so modern life is for most people dreamless. Given an opportunity to bring some great idea about dreaming to the screen, the filmmakers instead make a fantasy that is complicated, over-acted and so unrealistic I am just amazed that so many dreamless people have given it such a high rating. Dreaming takes place inside the human spirit, real dreaming takes place among groups of people. But people no longer know this. Dreaming evolved in the human mind from the many thousands of generations people spent living and sleeping together...which they no longer do. As an experienced dreamer I think this film is useless. As one who likes a good film, I think it is useless. Modern people just don't get it, and this sadness is the major component in the new world order.",0
"I will start by saying that Inception does indeed have a clever premise, or at least one that sounds good on paper: A group of people who steal information from people's dreams are hired to put an idea in someone's head. Cobb's back story and the way he was haunted by his mental image of his ex-wife was genuinely fascinating. However, all of these nice, fresh ideas are lost in a hurricane of absolutely awful and pretentious storytelling. People have often praised this film for having clever writing, but it strikes me that the film is just deliberately trying to be needlessly complicated to appear smarter than it really is. I say ""needlessly"" because, when you get right down to it, the overall plot of Inception is not all that complex, so the film just comes across as pretentious.One of the first problems I had with the film is something I thought was present in Christopher Nolan's Batman films to a lesser extent (but those films had the benefit of having straightforward story lines and memorable characters): We are presented to a concept that could never happen in real life. That's not the problem. The problem is that the film delivers its ludicrous plot in such a straight-faced dead serious manner that it breaks my willing suspension of disbelief. In a film that took itself slightly less seriously, I might not wonder as much about where the technology to travel into someone's dreams came from, but here, it just begs for an explanation. If the film weren't trying to have a realistic atmosphere, I might buy that you can do this by injecting chemicals into your arm, then dream up more chemicals to travel into dreams within dreams, but here, it just comes across as absolute nonsense.None of the characters in the film, with the possible exceptions of Cobb, Mal and Fischer, were interesting or memorable in the least. In fact, most of the characters don't really even feel like people as much as they feel like soulless chess pieces that exist only for the purpose of advancing the plot. As a result of this, I could not have cared less about what was happening in the film, and towards the action sequences at the end, I was on the verge of falling asleep. I'm sorry, but watching people with no personalities battling generic gun wielding masses (who, in a stunning lack of originality, are apparently supposed to represent Fischer's subconscious) just isn't entertaining.Bottom line, Inception is a boring, pretentious and rather nonsensical film. It has a nice premise that sounds good on paper, which is why I really expected to like it, but found it a letdown.",0
"stolen from the anime PAPRIKA ,watch paprika and you'll know what i mean. almost every single detail is stolen from it , you call Nolan a genius i call him a thief ,he is a genius in the art of stealing the hall damn thing was a stolen nightmare that am happy that i woke up from ,or did i? too bad i don't have that little stupid thing that DiCaprio uses to know if he woke up from such a nightmare or not cause i see its still ranked high in this site (not that this sites rankings are important any how , i Prefer rotten tomatoes),so that means am still stuck in this nightmare. enough is said cant afford to waste more letters reviewing this piece of overrated trash.",0
"I only arrived at the 35 minutes mark on this one and I had to turn it off. I never do this, commenting on a movie I haven't seen in its entirety, but I will make an exception in this case because it reeked of pretentious and ""interesting"" from the very start. Christopher Nolan must be so full of it by now, with the success of the Batman series, that he thinks he can discard some platitude on to the screen, by relying on big stars and some teenage fantasy...and by the way, other than Watanabe,Caine and Berenger, what's with all the teenage looking actors (I have to admit, good ones)? For a second there, I thought they are turning Beverly Hills 90210 into a movie. I admire Leonardo di Caprio as an actor, but if I ever see him in an action man-hero sequence again, I'll call Kate Winslet to squash him like a bug (in Titanic, she looked huge compared to him),he's just not believable in those roles (and I thought Charlie Sheen looked ridiculous in the 80' s and '90's) no matter how much he tries, sometimes it works sufficiently, sometimes it doesn't but the fact that he seems to look for those roles all the time, and what a shame, compared to his earlier roles.I'll just stop here, I've rarely received such a bad vibe from a movie. The incredible special effects (which i acknowledge with 1 point) only made it worse, since they were supporting crap.",0
"I really do not have anything new to add here. The negative reviews already posted say it all. If you thought this movie was good, you probably did not get it at all. If you know it sucked, then you understood it perfectly well. This was the biggest waste of time since Leonard part 6. Just because you are in a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream, that alone does not in any way make a movie complicated or good. Well crap, it says the review has to be ten lines or more, so here it goes. I have used this website for a long time and this is the first review i have ever done. The reason i felt so compelled in doing so is seeing how highly rated this stupid movie is. If you loved this movie for its ""complex storyline,"" go ahead, turn on spike TV and wait for wwe wrestle mania to come on and write me a gushing 10 star review about the complex storyline and the butt kicking inside a butt kicking inside a butt kicking inside a butt kicking.",0
"*** This review may contain spoilers *** May be I expected too much from this movie, which was supposed to ""change the way I see things"". Well, it did not change anything, and certainly not the way I look at things. May be it changed the way I look at people who think this is the best movie ever made.It's long, tedious, they go through layers after layers, why, we do not really know. The characters are numerous, flat, (some may argue that this is a dream so they are supposed to be flat), but strangely enough they are quite consistent, they never change, which is not consistent at least with my dreams.And if you ask people why this movie is so fascinating and ""complex"", you might end up with the following conversation: ""it can not be explained with words, it's a story about a guy who gather a team to go through different layer of dreams to alter, blah."" ""Yes, I got that and?""""But I can't tell you the whole plot, I might spoil it"" ""I saw it, try me."" ""Euh, his wife blah blah... about the dream thing, life, death, redemption, there are so many themes in this movie"" ""And?"" ""Euh, I don't know, you need to think."" ""Ah...""I guess many people confuse complexity and redundancy. These guys just go through layers and layers of dreams, wrapped non-sense pseudo-scientific verbiage. Than he sees his wife again and again, and ""kicks"" back again and again, fights again bad guys again and again. And what? This is not complex, this is redundant and boring!Many people mentioned to me that there was a trick at the end of the movie... Actually, the end is a kind of pale copy of Orange Clockwork ending, and you can expect the trick from the beginning. Orange clockwork, the hurt locker, usual suspect, this is how you end a movie, and I did not see it coming from the first 15 minutes of the movie.In the category ""the director tries to drive you crazy"", Donnie Darko, Mulholland drive and, if we stick to Nolan universe, Memento gets my vote, not Inception. Or go watch Matrix again, or Dark city, or whatever movie you want to, that lasts less than 2 hours.Bottom line, I was bored during the projection, and that's one of the worst movie I've ever seen. 2 points because I did not leave (which makes it a better movie than Titanic to me).",0
"A shame that this movie is rated so highly on IMDb. Let me tell you this, this movie is NOT a masterpiece and doesn't even deserved to be among the top 250 of the best movie of all time. A true masterpiece has to be flawless and this movie is worth at most 5.8, no more. The neuro-nonsense that follow suit from a scientific and a philosophical point of view, Inception doesn't make any sense at all...Inception must start with a self-consistent theory of how the human brain works. What is a memory? What is a dream? Because most of us human beings walk around with only very fuzzy answers to these questions, filmmakers are able to take rather outlandish positions on them without arousing any hackles.In the case of Inception, the unstated premise of dreaming is that one one is asleep, one is inhabiting what essentially amounts to a parallel reality external to the mental state of the dreamer. This premise makes for an admittedly entertaining film, but it is preposterous. Dreaming is an entirely subjective experience; everything is an illusion generated and perceived by the brain itself. You can no more ""enter"" someone else's dream than you can enter into a movie that's playing on the multiplex screen.If you ""wake up"" from a dream and realize that you're still dreaming, you haven't entered a different level of some dream-reality continuum -- you've just experienced another illusory sensation. Contrary to the premise of the film, there is no ""architecture"" of a dream. We may feel like we're inhabiting an elaborate, detailed and consistent landscape, but that's just part of the illusion. There are some ideas about dreaming in the film that are actually accurate. For instance, it's true that they are powerfully influenced by emotion and subconscious cognition. And we often do wake ourselves with a powerful muscle spasm, which sleep researchers call a ""hypnic jerk."" But the movie also trades in ideas that amount to little more than folklore. It toys with the old idea that if you die in your dream, you will also die in real life.In the movie, if you die in your dream, you will enter a kind of coma. For obvious reasons, there is no evidence for bangungut-like phenomena, or rather any evidence has gone with the dreamers to their graves.What about the idea that time slows down within a dream, that an elaborate sequence of events in dream-space can take place in a few seconds of real time? As it happens, this claim has been investigated by researchers exploring lucid dreaming, and the results indicate that if there is any such effect, it is fairly small. Okay, but does any of this matter? Scientific error is rife in popular entertainment.I'm prepared to argue that Inception's misconceptions are both symptomatic and enabling of a damaging confusion that is rife in American society: namely, that between the internal subjective reality within our minds and the external, universally accessible reality of the ""real world."" It is this confusion that give rise to magical thinking and its myriad manifestations, from prayer-healing to ""The Gift"" and mystical notions about near-death experiences.Confusion about the boundary between dream and reality is particularly endemic among the religiously inclined, who often perceive dreams as the source of real-world information. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel, for instance, is located on a spot identified in a dream by the Emperor Constantine's mother, Helena.The perfect metaphor of this movie would be like this:""I liked it,""""I didn't really understand what was going on, but I liked it.""A tad overrated movie that need to be drop out of the top 250 movies list of all time. I'll give him 2 stars for the CGI effects who were indeed well done. That is all.",0
"I have rarely hated a movie more while I was watching it than this one, especially because I expected it to be very good to great. Despite an abundance of arresting visuals and and some good performances (especially by Madeline Cotillard), which save it from a really low rating, it is a bad movie in many ways. It is unbearably talky, overcomplicated, pretentious and boring. The last hour cycles the same four scenes over and over, and the only sign the movie is moving toward resolution is that the van the dreaming characters are riding in falls five feet closer to the river at each cycle. By then I was drifting in and out of consciousness like the characters. The film score pounds at you with incessant Teutonic heaviness. The main character is so thinly characterized that you have little reason to root for him. I like Leo much better when he plays a character in reality and stays out of dreams.",0
"I'm rather happy so many people like this film. It confirms my opinion of mankind. Other reviewers have pointed out the stupidity of this film and I advise everybody to go to the 'hated it' section of the reviews at IMDb and read up a bit about the true nature of this movie. It stinks. It is a corpse that has been underwater too long. It is terrible. It's just another Hollywood production with people running from bullets and never getting hit while too loud droning music tries to add tension where it is simply not there. Sure, there's things exploding and amazing visuals and allegations to human themes (without of course ever becoming real human emotions; allegations are much safer and more popular, because you don't have to actually feel, you can just sit back and go 'oooooh, aren't we amaaaaazing' - well, no, not really), there are characters that are never ever real people - I choose life over the dream here, really, and I hope my dreams never become as lousy as what I see here. In my dreams I feel, I touch, I smell. I dream music and books, I dream people, despair, tears. I dream violence, pain, sex, even death. I have stupid dreams in which I simply work, like I do all day. I sometimes run marathons and wake up exhausted. All these dreams are dear to me, because they are me. This film is not me, or anyone. Even my worst nightmare is preferable over this. At least I feel something there. My tiniest memory of someone I have loved is worth more than this film. A fragment of my capacity to hurt has more energy than this. I could go on, but you get the drift. I rarely give up on films, but this one I did. I quit after 45 minutes. And no, I'm not going to give it another go. As Hemingway said: 'I don't have to eat a whole bucket of snot, to know that it's snot.' One star for me trying to watch this.",0
"When a liquid is poured into a container, the liquid assumes the container's shape is a well known law of Phsyics. The underlying theme of this movie is Energy production. This story uses one's stages of dream states in individuals. Now comes Inception with its notion that it can change the liquid poured into the container, a chosen human target, thus altering that man's dreams and his consciousness for a desired outcome; A Dream within a Dream at deeper levels and stages of the human mind's dream states. This sums up the production of this nonsense spectacular special effects production, onward with baloney gibberish dialogs! It's ending is as pathetic as anyone could hope for! I felt disappointed with this movie, despite of the enormous efforts that were put into it by this production's Special Effects Unit who had copied and duplicated their special effects from ""Men in Black"" and from ""The Matrix."" All in all, this Sci-Fi story is an over publicized ESPIONAGE NONSENSE! I MEAN AN UTTER AND TOTAL NONSENSE!!",0
"INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes very annoying and I'm sure Inception holds the world record for saying the word 'dream' more times than any other.There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience, just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the film is about and what is happening.Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype.A previous reviewer wrote ""The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way"" and i totally agree.I've heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as it's so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot say but I can confess it's a fairly redundant mediocre film with an over contrived plot strung together by cliché action scenes. The plot concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for what it really is. The only real thought needed is that of the closing shot, (this is not a spoiler ).. does it tip or does it keep spinning? I smell a sequel.3/10",0
"I didn't like anything about this movie and I don't understand why people rate it high. Why do people lately anyway like movies that are inarticulate? The dreams were stupid and the characters too. Who cares anyway what happens in this film? Usually I can appreciate sci fi movies like Solaris. They are great to me and I enjoy the mystery and the futuristic scenery. But sadly Inception is pretentious and empty. I have to admit, I could only watch it for 1 hour, then I had to leave because it was a waste of my time, I rather do nothing actually. All along the movie the actors kept explaining things, and that killed the integral. I don't know why a wonderful actor like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has done some very artistic independent movies, wants to play this cardboard man? Leonardo diCaprio in Shutter Island will always be one of my favorite parts ever. You know what? It's that ""Look at me I'm very important"" style of acting that I dislike with Inception. It takes itself way too serious while the plot is no more than a thumbed B comic.",0
"I am from Argentina so my writing may contain a lot of spelling mistakes. Sorry for that.I saw this movie a couple of nights ago. I checked this web page as I usually do when i go to the cinema. 9.1, #4 movie in the whole history and a plot which contains different worlds with different rules seemed pretty interesting.3 Minutes of Movie were enough to realize that this was a typically popcorn movie with not much to learn about. Dialogues are stupid during the whole 2 hours and a half. The 3 or 4 excellent ideas that Nolan had for this movie, were constantly explained by the actors. Characters are simply Hollywood stars repeating clichés dialogues, with no background or description at all.On top of that, the movie constantly uses the Hollywood resource of using fire, explosion, shootings, fire arms, persecution, repeatedly. I find that extremely boring, but especially in this movie. Those short shots of gun firing and explosion going on, were simply ridiculous. A Guy firing at a Van which is at 1 meter of distance and missing several shots, is unbelievable.I believe the plot, and the main idea of the movie are really interesting and original. A world within a world is a fun plot. A Dream World with different rules seems really interesting and fun. I believe that this movie had a lot of potential, but it the end it resulted in another cliché movie from Hollywood.If you are looking for an action movie with excellent special effects, Inception is definitely a fine movie. If what you are trying to watch is a movie with a philosophical plot, with captious dialogues and intriguing sub-plots, re-watch The Matrix or Blade Runner.",0
"A mess about ""mind pirates""...or something. They enter peoples minds, bend reality and are hired to help a man to change his dying fathers mind to get control of his estate...but there are OTHER people who are trying to stop them.Wow! What a total disaster! This is one of those movies that make so little sense that people just assume they're not intelligent enough to ""get it"" and fall all over themselves praising it. This movie is not some revolutionary trend setter--does anyone remember ""The Matrix"" from 20 year ago? Also it sets up the rules of what's going on at the beginning. That's fine but they're thrown at you so fast and furious (with NO explanation) that I was totally lost. Then, after establishing the rules, they CHANGE them for no other reason than to confuse the plot and throw viewers off. THEN they introduce new rules when we're well into the movie! That's not clever or intriguing--it's playing with the viewers mind and deliberately making them lost and confused. To make it worse the acting pretty much sucks. Ellen Page is horrendous (and her character is never fully introduced or explained) and Joseph Godron-Levitt sleepwalks through his role. DiCaprio (who I THOUGHT was a good actor) is terrible. He gives yet another performance of a man who's tortured by some dark past and trying to get through it. He's done this many times before (""Revolutionary Road"", ""Shutter Island""). Can't he do anything else? Also when he breaks loose and start yelling I didn't believe it for one second and I couldn't take it seriously. I've seen that before! The admittedly great special effects can't help. I walked out after 90 minutes. The movie is constantly pulling the rug out from under the viewers and I got this smug attitude that the filmmakers were having a fun time playing with the viewers and thinking they were smarter than they actually were. Dull, annoying and very full of itself. Don't bother.",0
"I know its meant to be about dreams....is that why i found it so hard to stay awake to watch it? This is a typical American shoot'em up/blow'em up crapola with ugly characters woodenly reading out a script so bad it's embarrassing. Right from the start, an amateurish gun shot/smash-up everything you can find scene I realised this was going to be another Hollywood failed attempt at making a thriller. If only the guy who made the ads for it had also directed the movie, sighhh Perhaps they hoped to mix Medium with Bourne Identity, but failed so badly i kept dozing off. Think eyes wide shut, or mothman 2 for dragging script and plot, and imagine the team at sesame street being tasked to think up Matrixlike effects and you have it, utterly utterly disappointing.",0
"The essential problem with this movie is that it has no logic rules to abide by. And, mind you, even dreams have rules, as Freud started to hint. A rule is not ""I do what pleases me"", which is what we see throughout this movie. That's arbitrariness. Mr. Nolan should learn from hard working writers to build seriously an imaginary universe, like Tolkien, Borges, Frank Herbert, etc. Worlds with RULES. Because without rules, the writer can do whatever pleases him any moment. And as anything is possible,... who cares? And as one stops caring, one starts to get booooooored. Specially if in a supposedly imaginative story you get punished endlessly with the oh-so-hackneyed pursuits and shoot-out of faceless bad guys... Yah, yeah, yeah, original, new and unseen as an Edwin S. Porter film. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawnie!",0
"Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world _ i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess.",0
"I can't believe this movie is voted #4 best movie, this movie start with such an interesting topic and I truly hoped for a amazing, sophisticated and well executed movie but...,the story could be sublime however the execution is just clumsy, the director tried too hard and wanted the movie to be big. But beside dreams, this movie is nothing but a collage of scenes with major capitol cities; crime involves rich person dying; repetitive, half ass architectural and interior designs, and of course, endless people and car chasing plus everlasting fights..this movie is a combo of many movies, you don't need to see this movie if you have seen some of the followings: 80's James Bonds, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Memento, butterfly effect, Ronin, the day after tomorrow (another really lousy movie)..., the worst thing is many scenes in Inception are quite directly replicated from those movies.the art design of the movie is terrible, I can see the art director only knows M.C. Escher and may consult some mediocre architects, I highly recommend he or she to try some acid or just simply ask people about how their dreams are like.by the way, in the theater seeing this movie, I felt annoyed every time when i see a logo, especially seeing the logo of Hyundai a thousand times, I started thinking about how much money Hyundai endorse and forgot the car chasing is still going on! Also I keep wondering about this: considering 5 minutes equal one hour per layer of a dream, do those people feel thirsty or wanting to go to the bathroom in their 50 year long dreams?For people saying that we should have some imagination to appreciate this movie, I truly believe that these people are just finding excuses for this movie and for themselves too. sorry I just can't stare at a pile of crap and imagine that's filet mignon :p",0
"I am beating myself up because I fell for the hype. Unfortunately I spend money on that nightmare, next time I go to a movie which has been so hyped I make sure it is a free screening. It is a nightmare. If you have these kinds of dreams you are a deeply disturbed person. Shooting, car crashes, explosions, shootings, car crashes, explosions that is all that troubled soul dreams about. I usually do not go to movies consisting of shootings, explosions, car crashes and crumbling buildings. Only when I really feel that a movie gives a realistic rendering of war will I go and see such a movie because I am trying to understand that part of human nature. But I went. It was hot and I thought it would be nice to sit in a cool movie theater. Well first the movie theater was warm and I had to fight to stay awake , then they switched the air-conditioning on high and we all got frozen. I was hanging in checking my watch every three minutes and hoping that eventually I would see that great movie people were raving about. Nothing. After 148 painful and boring minutes I tried to getup and leave but was frozen stiff and it took me a few seconds to get moving. The credits had just started rolling but the movie theater was already empty, obviously everybody could not wait to leave. There were only a few people anyway in the afternoon show. This was my first movie in eight months because there was absolutely nothing worthwhile seeing in the theaters nearby. I love to go to the movies and I love the big screen so when the ticket lady asked me if I wanted XP I said yes. I was disappointed by that too. Not worth the money. Hopefully there will some movie I want to see in the coming months, otherwise I will stick to books.",0
"From the suggestion of this film and numerous ads on TV during the films release I had the idea it might follow through with some of DiCaprio's better choices of scripts in recent years.Unfortunately after a long wait for the DVD release in my local rental kiosk, the rental became available a month after the commercial release.Sadly Inception was barely worth the dollar rental.Alluring special effects don't help the fact a confusing intellectual premise eventually degrades into a standard machine gun shoot em up.Very disappointing.",0
"I don't know what it is about this movie that people get so carried away with. I guess being under 20 helps, although I talked to some younger friends who thought the movie to be just as insipid, lame and boring as I did.I read that people find this movie's complexity to be one of its strong points. This is quite sad since it's about as complex as the basis of your average video game. I guess that same thing has set the standard to determine what is complex today in films and what is not. Complexity in my book has something to do with multiple layers, each with its own intrinsic appreciation, and is recognized rather easily. The effect namely being that when you miss a significant part of the story, like when watching a good detective, you no longer understand what is going on. I must have at least dozed off 3 times during Inception but wasn't even remotely challenged to work something out that wasn't already all too clear about 15 or 20 minutes in.The characters were unlikable and uninteresting across the board and the same rather goes for the whole of what the movie considers to be its plot. A James Bond type of story arc which doesn't really make the viewer care for it's outcome since such is already pretty clear because Nolan uses the same frigging formula. We got the secret agent, a pretty damsel, a world threat and a plethora of nameless villains with guns, some even on skimobiles! At any given point during ThaT particular scene, I expected a venerable Roger Moore to rush out from behind a snow covered spruce, cunningly herding his chasers into a trap of what appears to be 007's stretchable tie conjoined to and in between two trees.Inception is nothing more than the next action/chase time-waster laced with the compulsory CGI and endless fake-explanatory dialog as if it was breaking down a match between two chess masters. I found it all way too silly and turned it off 15 minutes before the credits rolled. Another cell phone company commercial stretched into feature film length with some big names attached for a complementary audience who can't tell, and couldn't care less to be able to tell, shït from Shinola. 5/10 for the otherwise competent direction, editing and sublime sound editing.",0
"So, it's all a dream.When in high school, I remember one of our English teachers putting a ban on essays that turn out to be a dream. His argument was that one could just write all sorts of nonsense and take the easy way out by revealing at the end that it was a dream.Overlong seemingly pointless car chases and gun battles... Plenty of these in re-runs of the A-Team...All this messing about in the hotel, fighting guards, tying up bodies and moving them around. These guys aren't very creative / resourceful in their dreams, are they? However attractive Marion Cotillard is, the sub plot became very irritating indeed. The grenade launcher should have been used on her early in the dream! As for the end, an easy cop out: it's a dream, folks.I won't go into the cgi / scenery designs. There was stuff just as good in computer games designed for the Amiga and Atari.There was great potential, but this movie is a mess.",0
"This movie has several dazzling special effects. But other than that, what is there to say. Well, mainly....YAWN. Many comedy movies are just sketches strung together with the barest of threads to hold the plot together. Inception does the same thing for action movies, the action sequences are held together with a plot that pretends to be complicated, but in reality is wafer thin and yet full of holes that you could put Incepton's entire budget for special effects into each one of them. Inceptions virtual world does not impress because it is a work of beauty without any connection with dreams at all. Take away the special effects and you are left with substandard, uninspired acting and a boring movie.",0
"Inception has a potentially good plot, however it is impossible to fully develop a plot in a movie where a catastrophe takes place every two minutes. The characters are played by great actors, so I know this is not the fault of the cast. The characters seem shallow because there is really no chance to ever get to know them. Some will say, ""that guy never understood the plot"" but they are wrong. I understood the plot, I just don't see the need for a plot with so many bogus action scenes. I think if this movie were slowed down and the actors had a chance to work their magic it could have been a really good movie. As it is I can't give it more than two stars.I don't normally review movies, so I don't know what a ""spoiler"" is. Jim McDowell",0
"I had huge expectations for this film reading all its glowing reviews. And yet even before it started and the menu fired up, alarm bells were going off. Explosions left right and centre, great CGI.....all suggested a lack of substance. For the first 20 minutes, I couldn't believe just how bad this film was. Drop the viewer into a complete state of confusion to look good?.....except that this is always a risky strategy, one which a only few films have eloquently pulled off, the nearest comparable being The Matrix, which this most certainly isn't- although it tries so hard to be in terms of style and delivery. Yes the CGI and special effects are at times breathtaking. It's just such a shame that the storyline was utterly ridiculous, disjointed, confusing dispassionate and so very, very boring. Great effects DO NOT make for a great film necessarily. A note on casting. Like the film, this is truly awful....what on earth was Leonardo Di Caprio thinking?! My wife totally embraced the subject matter- she fell asleep and the only thing stopping me from dozing off was the desperate hope that that this film would improve. It didn't. Inception completely encapsulates all the worst in Hollywood. Utter rubbish.",0
"Based on reviews I was hoping this was a ""different"" American film in the sense that it will have substance, subtlety and that it will make me think. It did not, it did not and it did not again. It is your typical Hollywood flick with car chases, shooting galore, explosions, fistfights, pretty boys and girls - the whole nine yards to sell tickets to the ADHD generation of teenagers. I gave it 3 stars - instead of just 2 - because the special effects are absolutely astonishing. This film wishes to be clever but really is not and does not make a lot of sense either. It reminded me of the teachers/professors who were confusing on purpose in order to make us believe they are smarter than we were.",0
"While it seems ingenious to invent a cunning conceit such as the one deployed in this film it is like a novel that uses neologisms and errant grammar and punctuation: it's effects tire and it seems less than it wishes it to be.The dramaturgy and logic of Inception is very simple and relies on a 'reductio' argument which is quite clear within 10 minutes,(and is absurd because of the logical impossibility of the argument itself like Wittgenstein's proof against skepticism) but it's true failing is not that: it is in fact the use of change and sudden effects as plot devices because once employed they heighten awe but kill any suspense or connection with the characters in the film. There is no reason or emotion in caring about characters that are chaff in a rather ordinary logician's game.Years ago Thomas Pynchon was considered an important writer, and the author and critic (and sometime film critic) Peter Ackroyd wrote an astute review of his major work, ""Gravity's Rainbow"", in which he ridiculed the ease of such writing; it's deceptive cleverness; it's egoism, and its immaturity because it is so overtly obvious, and like anything childish, of no real lasting interest artistically. Inception is that too. Instantly forgettable.",0
"First, let me say that the acting was good, and that Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor. The bad rating I gave this movie has nothing to do with the actors' performances.I gave this a bad rating because the writing was just bad. The CONCEPT of the movie was excellent. When I first saw the trailer, my imagination went wild. The scope of where you could go and what you could do with a concept like inception in people's dreams is almost endless.But, where did they run with it? Guns? Explosions? Grand Theft Auto? Matrix wannabe? These are the words that came to mind when I watched this.And the plot, if that's what you call it, is nothing. It's convoluted minus the imagination, mystery, and intelligence. It's like they made it complicated so it could SEEM intelligent. But trust me, it's not! About 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie, the ending became VERY predictable. Even so, I thought, ""It's about the journey not the ending. Right?"" Except the journey sucked. How come everybody in this movie only dreams about automatic weapons? I know, I know. There are a bunch of explanations in the movie, but the explanations are terrible and not thorough enough to be believable. For example, the characters explain the assault weapons in the dreams by saying the subconscious had been militarized.What kind of stupid explanation is that? Am I supposed to take that seriously? It seems like the movie is just asking for an excuse to become a pseudo-Matrix action flick. Except the Matrix was much better than this.Well... What a waste of a good concept... but mindless action flicks can be fun, even when they continuously, pretentiously claim to be thought-provoking..... But then there's the looooong drawn out mushy ending that breaks up the action and isn't befitting an action flick at all.So, congratulations Hollywood. You managed to take a good concept of a movie with a great cast, remove all imagination and intelligence, while simultaneously turning it into a mediocre action flick with a terrible ending.Hollywood fails again... 4/10 stars",0
"The only way to describe this movie in one paragraph is it was like the first time a person has sex, it's hyped for about 2 or three years of your life till finally it's prom and you got the parents station wagon and you got a hotel in the country all set up for your first big night of love. Then you go to pick your date up and she's gotten braces over the weekend. OK, not the worst thing in the world. Then you slip and fall while shaking the dads hand and karate chop his balls and grab her mothers blouse and rip it off on the way down. Then on the way to the prom you get a flat and you go and change it and you get oil all over your tux. Then you go to the prom and you think it'll be so cool now that more people are being added to the mix. But it's not, and it sucks because there's now so much sexual tension built at this time the dudes don't wanna dance for fear of boners and the girls don't want to for the same reason... Then you finally leave and get out to the hotel and you think ah well, this whole night was crap but this will redeem it. This will make it all better... Then you realize she's got braces... And her hymen's still intact... And what ensues is 20 minutes of nothing but blood, pain, and screams of agony coming from both parties till eventually you can't even look at her anymore and you wont be able to jerk it for a month now because your scabbed penis needs time to heal.... Yeah thats what inception was like to me....Stick with Momento...esk stuff dude",0
"Inception is a lie and like all legitmate hollywoods irregardless of who is doing what to whom there is only the technology that allows this hysterical calculator(that is all this film represents) in this motion picture to perhaps make money.There seems not much more to suggest and that would be if this film made money,? Well did it ? This is what is a most unusual point to all this,and that would be if this particular film did not make money what else is this film doing if in fact it did not make money? What is required to know better or perhaps to truly know well what the viewer is looking at when as a viewer,the viewer as it were watches the motion picture ""Inception"".There is as well another consideration and that is if in fact the very participation in the watching of any motion picture is such an experience as to be a unwholesome experience. I believe it is that(unwholesome) and even more so provides for a disguise so to mislead any who might be drawn for what ever reason to watch such a film or for that matter to watch such are the films of Hollywood,California.There is no degree of involvement in the making of this film that is in fact authentic and as illegitimate that that might sound like it is an illegal search and seizure which allows a thief to be masqueraded as the man with the candy.This film is not new nor is this film what it appears as is as well.The result when viewing such a film is that there is no time that is real nor is there a place as to any particular event is concerned and if that isn't enough there is no definition as to not if there is a capacity to dream but how do we provide the ability to interject another ability that could pass as a dream.This is the handiwork of a masquerade with any here who believe believe not in this motion picture as there is no dreaming there is only the ability to transmit the stimulus with the image that is what masquerades as a ""dream"".It is as well imposed upon the body of the human race so to provide a unmistakable influence.The influence as the film provides such a witness has a goal of influence pure and simple this film is merely more of the same as the same has meant since as it were its inception.It is its invention that is at the source of this worlds ability to influence anything with merely more of the same being all that the viewer will ever be looking at.The inventor as well as the inventors many inventions are all patented and do it is believed remain so.There were some 700 separate inventions with which this unwholesome day in this world occurred when one Nicola Tesla discovered how to bind energy across wide open space many many miles from nowhere including even deepest darkest space.This is the field of regard it is as well the ability to network with many disparaging elements so to influence even say Adolf Hitler(I kid you not).Though 1920 is the year of radio's invention and 1921 the year Berlin radio started to broadcast it was a good time before this point in time that Tesla's inventions and subsequent patents were in place.The better premise would be to know through Tesla's own words as to what capacity does what he invented provide and without to much trouble Tesla's's own misgivings provide for the very problem of being under the influence of a lie.Though this lie was not meant to interfere with the human race that is exactly what has occurred.The money men of Teslas's own day are at the root cause as to the necessity to influence anything outside of an antenna.They remain as perhaps a cog in the wheel that very nearly saw to its conclusion not to long ago.This wasn't Tesla's design this was there influence on his attempt to bind energy that it was not to be unless of course they could extract a measure if you will of revenge upon humanity.This is the masquerade that there is a profit motive in this foreign power as well as an aggression not to be deterred in its inability to be regulated properly.This is an imperfect science which has meted out suffering through this field of regard.(network field)It is this thief in the night and it is as well the exploiter of human flesh that this film is providing the viewer with.This is what this film is up to and it has been such since it inception.",0
"This had a lot of talented actors and some nice visual effects. Sadly I could not get into the story this movie was trying to convey. Just didn't make sense to me.Leonardo has been in two flops that I just saw within a year and the other is Shutter Island.. I wouldn't waste your time trying to watch either of these movies. In closing I always like to see Ken Watanabe.Some movies that were similar to this that I really liked were the Matrix and The Fountain. This movie is nowhere near the caliber of those movies and I find it hard to compare this movie to anything, but way - WAY over rated. I really liked the movies Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and recommend that and also Resident Evil : Afterlife with Milla Jovovich.",0
"There were only a handful of moments throughout ""Inception"" where I didn't feel like I was watching actors going through the motions of a plot too complex for them to keep track of during filming. I imagined the directorial staff telling them: ""Hey you, run over here, then turn around that way.....just do it, don't ask why right now!""I don't think DiCaprio was very well cast. He can be intense, but often comes off like a teenager posing as an adult. This role called for someone more eccentric with a mysterious presence. Likewise, the architect girl seemed like she belonged in high school, though she was nice to look at.The plot had a good premise but it barely got me involved psychologically. After the first hour or so, the layers of complexity got ahead of themselves and erased any real feeling of suspense. You need a decent grasp of what's actually going on to feel suspense. Due to the lack of focus, I found my eyes straying to things like the Joliesque bump on the wife's forehead, etc. A good film doesn't let the mind wander.After a point, this thing became so convoluted that I was trying to figure out how it was made (on a technical level) rather than putting serious effort into following the plot. Yes, I got the gist of the dream layers and the general plan, but the timing of the ""kicks"" became too hard to follow.I spent half my viewing time wondering why dreams, which in real life contain random absurdities, could be so precise, down to the timing of bombs. These dreams never seemed like ones I've experienced, so the main premise of the movie was ""kicked"" out the door early on. Technology- wise, it seems highly unlikely that people could share dreams except for random electrical pulses.Maybe it played better in a big theater with the crowd adding to the substantial hype that preceded it. I saw it at home on Blu-ray and it just didn't fire me up. I even considered turning it off twice, but the very end was clever enough to make it worth the slog.",0
"Long, BORING, never-ending! In 15 minutes you do not care who and why in this or that reality...You cannot even sleep there- too noisy... TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!! Tasteless chewing-gum... Almost as disappointing as Shutter Island (that was at least shorter)... DiCaprio is protecting wild nature or not eating meat - it's OK...But to take part in those incredible boring to death movies - it's really a failure... You come to see something really extraordinary - but - again and again - kinda art-house with visual effects - AND DISGUSTINGLY LONG AND BORING!!!",0
"The Not-Too-Revealing-Summary: Inception is a thought-provoking action movie that is best tagged with keywords like ""con-men,"" ""corporate espionage,"" ""psychological thriller"" or even ""philosophy.""The-Not-Too-Revealing-Review: Inception takes a very simple - and very traditional - genre and fashions it around a complicated idea. The movie is truly a work of art - in a positive sense as much as in a pejorative sense. Director Christopher Nolan takes a fairly complicated notion and unravels it for the audience in such a way as to entertain visually and provoke thoughtfully. The movie was, however, art for art's sake. It was a demonstration: the goal was not to amaze, thrill, or surprise but to bewilder. It was a presentation of a mental knot and then the step-by-step exhibition of how one would disentangle it. In this regard the movie was a success. Some of my many grievances (and they were many) against the film: The action scenes were quite obviously padding for the core of the film. Most of the scenes were shot in indoor, extremely confined situations - and though stylish - they were not the strikingly visual scenes I had hoped for. The big, outdoor, scenes where this big budget film had a chance to truly impress failed completely. The fight scenes where the movie had the opportunity to provide some iconic segment - looked like men hoisted in the air with wires. Between two of Nolan's other works - Memento and the Dark Knight - Inception was more Memento. The attention to detail present in the Dark Knight made it into Inception - but only into the unraveling of Nolan's idea. The many filler scenes lacked this consideration and left the film with a duality of wonderfully thought-through details interspersed with inanity.Some other odds and ends: Tip of the hat to Nolan for leaving some things unexplained. It is unclear if this is truly present day or some time in the future and the director rightly leaves that for the audience to decide for themselves. Explanations for the mechanisms of the technology are left alone - and for the better. I could not have told you who Tom Hardy was before this film but after this performance I look forward to whatever it is he may do next. I hope Nolan credits a certain 1999 film (whose title I shall not mention so I do not spoil this movie for anyone else). The relationship goes far beyond similarity or inspiration. Nolan took it further (with a budget of over $130 million more) but it is bothersome to see Inception heralded for ""originality."" Overall I cannot recommend this film. It was neither enjoyable nor entertaining to watch. I can respect the skill it takes for someone to make a house of cards but in the end I have no real desire to stare at a house of cards.",0
"If you are about ten years old and like ridiculous far fetched plots this movie is for you. I read the first glowing review and I am wondering what planet the reviewer is from. The plot is a mess, the special effects are lame and the whole think stinks. Don't waste you money..it is worth $1 when it comes out on Red Box but even this assumes you are desperate for a distraction. I was thoroughly disappointed in Decaprio's acting and the story line screams a desperate attempt at trying to do something different rather than crafting a good movie. The child actress female lead...looks to be about 15 years old is totally miscast. She does not do herself justice when compared to her role and acting Juno. Finally the plot seems to have been padded to make the movie fill time. At the end they seem to have run out of budget and simply don't explain how Decaprio is saved or saves himself or something. Stupid stupid stupid.",0
"It has received so many positive reviews because nobody dares say it was made based on very illiterate understanding of human mind and dream psychology. Similar to the story of the silly naked king who thought he wore the most beautiful dress that only wise people could see, and so no one dared say they could not see any dress on him! OK, so we use a briefcase containing a large button and a few wires to enter anyone's dream and if you have an architect with you, the whole thing will be somehow just fine, and all these details that happen there are somebody's projection or memory, or ... but don't worry because someone will tell you what they are! Not enough? OK, you will be able to use the dream version of that briefcase machine to still move one layer deeper, and go to the dreams of a dreaming person?! How stupid that this get? Seeing all these positive reviews I just realize the brilliance of the naked king with invisible clothes to stupid people. I am not against novel concepts, Matrix was such a novel one, but inception is a mockery of science, human mind, dream psychology, and more! 4 stars only for the special effects.",0
"i cant believe this movie has this great rating!! it was down right ridiculous!! the idea of several people being in the same dream. this is what happens throughout the movie. its impossible, and its just not even made to be believable, even by the movie. nothing in this movie would ever happen in real life, nor would anyone want it to.the whole movie objective is spent trying to plant an idea in someones head(through a dream) in order to get him to destroy/sell off his company in real life. if you wanted to plant an idea in someones head to influence him to do something, why the hell would you use a dream to do it??? who ever acts on stuff that happens to them in their dreams?? i mean i dream every week i can fly like superman, but i don't wake up and go diving off buildings!! cause its just a dream, the events that happen in dreams didn't really happen!!! so why would i take real life action on them..man this movie was such a blunder, i cant believe so many people bought into it. there were a few cool visuals, but nothing spectacular. the plot is very poor and the movie is trying to tell too much in too little time, and it all ends up in a mess of a movie",0
"**Only a very teeny spoiler** Well, what can I say? Inception was the most overrated movie I've seen in years. The plot had more holes than a string vest.I found the first 20 mins dull at best, and was easily distracted (I actually paused the film and ordered a pizza/had a look at Twitter/read another message board...). I even restarted the film to give it another chance, but to no avail.Then for a whole 20 mins, it managed to keep my attention before leaving me again thinking 'why I am watching this?' for the next hour or so. I finally gave in with 45 mins to go when it turned into a Bond movie with snow skiing chases that appeared from nowhere.I didn't give a toss about the characters who did nothing to make me want to care, the plot didn't fill more than a few minutes of the 145 mins I stayed with it and bar a few nice CGI tricks - I can't say there was anything not done better in other movies many times over and in a great deal less time.Give me Total Recall for dream based plots and action any day of the week.The acting was average, the architect looked 17yrs old yet somehow became an instant expert in dreams/psychology and managed to be smug - was she the token precocious child that all writers include when their stories are dying on the page? Perhaps a cute pet dog would have helped here.It isn't often that I switch a film off because I think its pointless to carry on. Inception didn't even annoy me enough to see what happened at the end - I simply didn't care. How this is getting anything over a 6/10 is beyond me. I gave it a 4/10 and even then I think I'm being generous - it didn't even score on the So Bad It's Good chart.",0
"Inception makes the average moviegoer feel smart and I would have zero problem with that,unless fans weren't so extremely elitist and condescending. I DO get it...and neither love or hate it. Limited vocabulary but maybe a good read?DiCaprio has reached such super-stardom that can only be compared with Stallone,Schwarzenegger and Will Smith. Meaning:No matter who stars alongside him,he's the only one who sells the film.Just like in Shutter Island,Inceptions trailer only mentions LEONARDO.DICAPRIO.If Watanabe,Cotilliard,Murphy and the rest(Oscarwinners and Oscarnominees,come on) co-star,I might want to know. Studios,respect actors...and ON PAPER,the mix of actors intrigues. Plotwise though,it's all about Mal.Nolan had all the time he wanted to create a caper that was provocative or involved fates of main characters,danger! Morally ambiguous maybe! Yet,planting the seed in a business-mans head that selling his fathers company is his own idea is the result. HOW PG and unpersonal can we get? No room for both a new concept,a bold plot and developed characters...? Nope. Understand it could've been to get a mail-man to call in sick the next day,heist irrelevant. 80% of Inception evolves around the caper,still it merely becomes window dressing,a distraction from the core,the human heart that occasionally beats,being the relationship between Dom and his bad conscience in the shape of Cotilliards Mal.All scenes involving her are superb,it's a nuanced performance worthy of an Oscarnomination. Mal is dangerous,sad,disturbed, beautiful and Very dead. One scene especially involving a ledge is great,heartbreaking cinema. That the person who's most alive and complex is deceased..Paradox...but a good hint at the misuse of actors.Several actors could just've switched names,their characters don't have personalities. What did you do here,Christopher? They describe rules for the dreamworld,dream-extraction,describe what's happening at the moment, that's it.When Swick casted Watanabe in The last samurai,he knew the screenplay matched the mans potential. Nolan has with Batman begins and Inception twice wasted his talent...Murphy? Think I rather see him type-casted as sophisticated sociopaths alá Red Eye then see him as a blank page.Inception's the star and while a detailed construction, intentionally confusing and complex,you DO have to pay attention,complex does not equal intelligent. As you take the ride,things move fast and you're not allowed to break and examine. It's only when it's over you realize you were standing still all along. You are cleverly manipulated into believing the story makes you think(Cause you understand what you saw.Not the same..)or that your mind discovers philosophical metaphors. That you are witnessing something deep is shoved down your throat but depth is mostly absent.Sure,the film deserves the Oscars. Things sound great,look great. Buildings become bridges. An orgasm for the eyes. Pfisters camera-work here is great,very colorful,crisp,clean. Imaginative art direction. I dig Zimmers less-is-more score. In general the whole film's eye candy,perfect surface. The inside...?1.Alright,WAY too much shooting and ""violence"" going on here, considering everyone's sound asleep on a plane and thoughts are murdered. Would've been more intriguing with psychological tension instead of train-crashes and explosions but lack of a REAL physical threat only manages to turn suspense into a dream as well. Sleeping boy vs. thought in zero gravity is so pointless,the impressive CGI just confirms Nolans smug self-awareness of his competent,VISUAL execution and just cements the surface statement. 2. Limbo. Wouldn't a dream-extractors worst nightmare be LIMBO,wouldn't it come up in a conversation between professionals at some point probably? No...not even mentioned until drama occurs. 3.For the 5th time,a womans accidental death consumes a wealthy,white man between 30 and 35 with guilt that will define him and her role is again pivotal. It's getting old and predictable,I hope the issues are worked out by now.4.Last scene. It defines and sums up Inceptions feeling of surface reaching for depth and jaw breaking response,artistic pretensions,strained complexity for the sake of complexity rather then genuinely clever. Nolan in desperation wants to wrap it up so it leaves us scratching our heads... I was banging my head against the seat in front of me when the end credits rolled.He leaves you with two options,no scenarios or reasons that make or should make you come up with an own conclusion. Far from a thinking mans thriller. One of the two is a joke used when referring to funny,lousy twists in B-thrillers. So... No why or how,just IF...IF films were people,Nolans own Memento,The usual suspects or Fight Club would blush,look at 8.8 and put a pistol in their mouth when the words""Smart,thought-provoking thriller"" puts Inception next door to them. The ending insults us,a cop out. Definition of a writer not knowing neither how to quit while ahead or how a journey is gonna reach a classic destination worthy of the plots seemingly intricate layers and ambitions. Sooo...he passes the ball to you and washes his hands with 15 seconds to go,smart lad. A picture this celebrated for being smart should hold up under a magnifying glass. It burns up without you even turning it towards the sun,man. This is an experiment and Nolans monster looks good,but at times,it comes close to the IQ of Dr.Frankensteins creation. DiCaprio gives a solid and mature performance,Hardy makes the most of what little the script offers and gives Eames mannerisms,charisma and a sense of humor. Cotilliard is amazing like stated.The rest could've been portrayed by Gary Busey,Eric Roberts and Lindsay Lohan...Nolans 1st failure is a mix of beauty,superficial intelligence and posturing. Caught between a flawed,pretty entertaining film and a bad one. Mediocre becomes bad when it comes to this director....so shallow.",0
"""Inception"" is nothing more than a stupid, high-concept movie with an ideal target audience of geeky 14 year old boys who have little interest in the opposite sex. It's hard to believe therefore that this film has an average IMDb rating of 8.9 and has received such ecstatic levels of praise on this site.So, why don't I think that it is any good? Firstly, what is it ""about""? What are it's themes? Genuinely great contemporary film makers of the rational world , such as Michael Haneke, explore the fundamental elements of human experience and modern society. Haneke has explored the failure of communication, the influence of media, the difficulties of multi-culteralism, the survival of humanity and culture, the impact of violence etc etc. In comparison ""Inception"" has no themes or original ideas. The most interesting visual moments are lifted from a variety of sources ranging from ""2001"" to James Bond. The basic narrative consists of the struggle to make one huge corporation slightly bigger than another. Where is the human element in that? Where are the morals? Where is the redemption? The Capitalist system is helping the extremely rich get richer _ the wealth of the richest 1% has doubled over the last 10 years _ but do ordinary office workers and blue collars workers, who are getting screwed by the system, care whether one faceless giant corporation overcomes another? Where is the drama when you don't care about the outcome and don't care about the characters? It's a film that has no philosophical or human dimension. Indeed the treatment of the ""Mal"" character and the failure to have her impose some sense of human or emotional responsibility on the Cobb character show the film to actually be as morally bankrupt as the casino bankers. Human emotion and relationships are overlooked by boys who are in thrall to their CGI toys.Does it achieve what it sets out to deliver so far as atmosphere and tone are concerned? That great modern film maker of the subconscious world, David Lynch, has shown us that Cinema can show the dreams and nightmares of the human psyche, can show the ""other world"" that lives just below the tangible surface. But ""Inception"" use of dream states and the ""dream within a dream"" is extremely mundane. Comparing a work of genius, such as ""Mulholland Drive"", with this pedestrian fantasy demonstrates what a failure in atmosphere there is in this film. ""Inception"" is also completely lacking in sex. How can you have a film about dream states and the subconscious that is as flat and banal as this? Perhaps Christopher Nolan isn't comfortable in exploring this area? That might explain why he has agreed to cast Anne Hathaway, surely one of the least sexy leading ladies in modern cinema ( unless you get excited by the 11 year old/""Bambi"" look ) as sex icon Catwoman in his upcoming ""The Dark Knight Rises"". You just know all of the curves on this Catwoman are going to be part of the suit and as fake as the ""philosophy"" in ""Inception""! I've enjoyed several of Nolan's earlier films and I think ""Memento"" in particular is a fascinating film and a film that actually DOES have themes - of identity, memory and guilt. However, I think his move into the world of ""intelligent Blockbusters"" ( as if there can be such a thing!? ) have made him lose his way.The cast are uniformly flat in their performances. Some excellent performers such as Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Pete Postlethwaite etc are wasted in underdeveloped roles. At the core of the film is the perpetually furrowed brow and dead eyes of Leonardo Di Crapio. Indeed, one of the great mysteries of the modern cinema age is what, once great, filmmaker Martin Scorsese sees in this rubber faced, bland, not particularly intelligent presence. That's not to say that great sci-fi can't be made with a not very bright leading man. The first ""Matrix"" film is a wonderful film despite the somewhat befuddled presence of Keanu. But it is a great film because it has ideas, human drama, personal politics and the subtext that ""Inception"" lacks.The pacing throughout ""Inception"" is turgid, oh how I waited and waited for that white van to fall, and the po-faced self importance of the whole thing is laughable.Now that the big corporations own the studios, the distribution and the cinemas the films that get force fed to the public are decided by air heads in suits. As a result the average audience's exposure to intelligent cinema is in serious decline. It's a shame that an essentially vacuous piece of escapism like ""Inception"" is being spoken of as being an intelligent piece of film making because if this is the future of ""intelligent"" cinema then, ladies and gentlemen, cinema is dead.",0
"Not far into this film I thought it wasn't for me but my husband will like it. But after enduring more than half of it I realised that was an insult to his intelligence.Utterly boring and confused (rather than confusing) with pointless violence just for the sake of it. Will no doubt make a decent computer game.I am giving this 3 purely for the special effects, which are OK.If I never I see another film like this it will be too soon.I have never reviewed a movie on here before but I felt I must as that 9.2 rating has to change!",0
"I'm going to keep this short the movie was over hyped, I enjoy Nolans movie Memento, he really took a complex idea and made it work.In this movie the idea fails and seems to mimic and follow the lines of Matrix, although I feel Matrix had a better atmosphere, style, and creativity.Although this is not a bad movie, but in my opinion it is not worth a nomination for best picture, or the great reviews people are giving this movie.I loved the soundtrack, and the CGI was really top notch in this movie, what I didn't enjoy was how the dreams were perceived and were fleshed out they didn't seem like dreams and they couldn't control them like you would your dreams it was more like a computer world, or alternate reality/parallel universe.The story was also over complicated with subplots that took you away from the film. I felt like this movie was stuck in mud and the only way to break it up was to but some intense action sequences, which made it seem to much like the matrix.I will not say I hated this movie, but did not enjoy it the way I thought I would. I love dream/reality movies it my favorite topic it just seems like this movie went to close to the matrix instead of making a thought provoking movie about dreams/reality and what is real what is not...",0
"I found Inception to consist mostly of drawn out, overblown idiotic chases and shootouts. Mostly boring and some hilariously so.I found the floating, gravity defying scenes downright silly. Especially funny was when the 'Arthur' character stacked and tied up the rest of the sleeping crew in the hotel and floated them around.This film was a good 30-45 minutes too long in that respect. Way too much time spend on chasesThis whole idea of 'is this a dream or reality' thing is as old as the hills, even though I do in fact subscribe to many variants of the idea as part of my own philosophy. It doesn't, or shouldn't come off as some really 'deep thought' of a movie to most people. Unless, the genius lies in whether or not the poor film goer can follow the action or not.I just happen to think the movie was a cheap cgi infested shoot em up wrapped in a cynically presented metaphysical wrapper.Personally I enjoyed ""The Nines"" much much better in terms of this whole 'what is reality' movie theme.",0
"Warning: spoiler alert:After watching Inception I have this question to ask: The movie played with the idea, that we can't always tell the difference between a dream and reality. Sometimes when dreaming, we realize, that we dream and that helps us awake. Other times, we don't realize that we are dreaming and then we are stuck in the dream. The question, which everybody ask themselves is: Did Cobb awake at the end of the movie or did he kept dreaming? I would like to ask this: DOES IT MATTER? Because through the two hours, I didn't get any background of this guy. I don't know who he is, what he likes to do, where are his faults, what are his hopes for the future. I am not even sure if he has a wife- and if he does, if Mal exists, then I don't know anything about her too. Not to mention their supposedly small children. My point is: This movie didn't have any story, didn't have any heart, didn't have any life in it. All characters were just figures, with no background and no emotional structure. So what do I care about Cobb, or his wife, or his mission? Because I don't even know what his mission was- to make the Asian guy even richer? And if you think it is so wonderful, that the movie didn't gets any straight answers, let me tell you this: the movie doesn't even ask a question. It doesn't make you think, because, at the end of it- there is no story behind it. There is no moral dilemma, there is no character development. And I feel really sorry for Leonardo Dicaprio - who started as a very promising actor, but somewhere in the way decided to act important and pretend to be smart. First he made The Blood Diamond- a very good movie. Then he made 11th Hour- a very good environmental movie. And then he went vacationing with Naomi Campbell on an yacht. What better way to prove that you believe in what you preach? Don't make the mistake to believe Inception has anything to offer, but some false sense of self importance.",0
"This movie is a joke. 9.1 rating on IMDb? Better than Dark Knight, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Braveheart? After 10 minutes I just wanted to get out of the cinema, girls made me stay, and I suffered for 2 hours. Ridiculous plot. The whole idea is a mess. As soon as I realized, what this movie was all about, I just wanted to drop it. Chris Nolan, The Dark Knight is the best ever(due to Heath Ledger), but this one? It is beautifully executed, excellently done. It would be a masterpiece film, but this plot, this nonsense! Nonsense is the best way to describe this. There are movies, which are complicated, and I love'em. But to over-complicate a nonsense? Watch South Park's new episode(Insheeption)! That one tells you exactly, what this movie is like. Do not compare it with Matrix. That one is credible, possible, you can find logic in it, but not in Inception. I do not remember the last time, I wanted out of a cinema after 10 minutes! I would not recommend this movie to anyone! Nevertheless, Long live Chris Nolan!",0
"Let me begin by saying that Inception is not bad, but it certainly isn't great. Nolan's script fails in multiple areas that harm the film significantly.1. The characterization is mediocre. Most of the members of the team are one-note, shallow and uninteresting. This greatly hampers your emotional attachment to the film and prevents you from caring about the outcome. Compared to the intense and complex characters of The Prestige, Insomnia, and Memento, the cast of Inception appears to be mostly slick suits walking around and doing things.2. The grandiose themes and interesting concepts that existed in The Dark Knight or Batman Begins are nowhere to be found here. Terrorism, corruption, or duty are ignored for love (which is dealt with in some of the most trite dialogue ever).3. The plot is too twisty for it's own good, resulting in you appreciating it less as a film and more as a puzzle. Vaguity does not equal genius, contrary to many critic's beliefs.In conclusion, Inception is a visually stunning film with aspirations at being significant, but it fails. Is it a thoughtful blockbuster? Yes. Is it the worst film Nolan has ever made? Absolutely. Should you watch it? Yes.",0
"""Inception"" seems to be taking the premises of such films as ""Peter Ibbetson,"" ""Altered States,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to more elaborate lengths. Throughout this action flick _ and that is what it truly is, despite its pretenses _ I couldn't help thinking of the most recent James Bond thriller in which I lost track of who was who among the secondary characters because the identities they started with were revealed as false, but then the revelation itself was proved equally false (or at least dubious), to the point where you couldn't believe a word they were saying and ultimately you ceased to care. With ""Inception"" we get a lot of technical jabbering from the mouths of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page about what everything means or might mean as they ""share"" and ""engineer"" other people's dreams in order to infiltrate their subconscious to achieve their corporate goals. These dream states are filled with the usual action staples of racing and crashing vehicles, explosions and the liberal use of automatic weapons, accompanied here by huge crumbling cityscapes (less effective than the more modest melting away of various smaller environments in ""Eternal Sunshine""). There is nothing particularly dreamy about writer-director Christopher Nolan's dream world; aside from a few interesting computer-generated images like a whole city appearing to fold over upon itself, none of the effects stick in the mind or affect the viewer's juices. Marion Cotillard contributes her trademark broken heartedness. Page gives the same performance we are familiar with from her telesystems commercials. Cillian Murphy emotes richly as the kidnapped son of an energy industry magnate. The heaving score by Hans Zimmer sounds like hundreds of others.",0
"Rex Reed's review, which can be viewed on Rotten Tomatoes, says it all. I don't always agree with Rex, but the man is a movie critic of long-standing repute, and he's secure enough to call worthless dreck what it is. I read the blurbs of many other professional movie critics, and in one sentence, you can tell they're disingenuous, people writing what they've been told or paid to write. Spinners. Posers.Inception rating > 9 on IMDb is what Michael Moore was referring to when he said at the Oscars several years ago (he was referring to our national politics, foreign policy and political leadership at the time, but it applies to the mainstream media and all mass-marketing as well): We live in fictitious times.",0
"This film was supposed to knock my socks off! Well, I'm still wearing them, because this film was such a disappointment. I thought 'Memento' was brilliant, but 'Dark Knight' a con, although this was supposed to be a total Nolan film. It should have been his 'Heaven's Gate' ( a much better film by the way) but it has proved almost 'Titanic' (again a much better film). Indeed, the audience left the cinema asking each other 'did you enjoy it?' as if they thought it was rubbish, but had to find out whether it was OK to say it was! It was.Let's face it, the plot is little more than a pretend heist movie on a par with 'Ocean's 12.' But it is hidden away in a complicated story of dreams and dreamworlds - three levels worth with each level allowing more time in it compared to reality! Gottit? You should do because Di Caprio spends acres of screen time explaining it to the complete and utter boredom of the audience. Cinema, Doctor K - I think not. It all boils down to finding out why the hero's wife died and how are the gang going to plant an idea in the head of a major industrialist (eg Inception). Following this? As the climax boils (in an extremely prosaic dreamworld hardly worth the effort and CGI) on three different levels - one a minibus falling off a bridge (interminably in slow motion), the second Tom Hardy's screen test for the remake of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' complete with ski shooters, Blofeld's alpine fortress, and an enemy that cannot kill a hero from five yards!, and the third, a legoland where Di Caprio's wife is skulking siren-like to lure him to stay forever - the film really creaks and shows its' paucity of vision, script, characters, and downright boringness! I have to excuse some of it because I needed the loo and could not get out of my row! Yes, I had a totem which kept me firmly in reality ( I knew how long we had to go by how far the minibus had to fall!).And the plot holes - many, but the worst involved the Cillian Murphy getting killed in the second level which should have left him in mindless limbo on level 3, but he was dead there as well, while Ken Watanabe who died in level 2, became a very old man in level 3!!!! And right at the end, Cillian Murphy has been trained to resist dream thieves, and when he wakes up, he finds himself in the cabin with the gang but does not put two and two together and realise they are the real thieves having persuaded him in his dream otherwise!! Gettit? Don't bother, it was probably all Di Caprio's dream anyway - a load of old tosh that has Nolan laughing all the way to the bank, and many so-called serious critics facing the sack for lavishly overpraising a piece of mediocre tosh!!!",0
Like many others I cannot see this as a work of genius at all and believe this to be a really stupid movie.The dream team that can manipulate your dreams and waking ideas - Yeah Right - 'in your dreams'. That about sums it all up.The movie writes it's own rule book regarding dreams and assumes that time moves exponentially more slowly when you dream within dreams. There is no evidence for this as fact and my experience and understanding is that dreams can go both ways - sometimes an epic takes minutes and others an action takes hours.So having said that the whole conceptual context falls apart and crumbles into absurdity. And why would movement in a dream affect a dream within a dream as occurs in this movie? When you dream you leave the real world behind - until you awaken.This movie has been compared with the Matrix trilogy. Well it blatantly rips it off but that's another dream - or rather a fantasy. This movie doesn't even come close to Matrix which was truly original and at a stretch even plausible. This isn't.,0
I thought this was suppose to be a great movie? I am not about to sit around for longer than 45 minutes jumping from scene to scene trying to decipher what the hell the movie is about - when a movie should be telling me the story. This was awful. How is the world does this movie have a high rating? Who is rating this film. We turned this movie OFF after 45 Minutes for a reason - it was that bad. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME! If people on these websites don't start voting realistically the movie industry will think this is what you like to see - and will keep making these crap movies. Just because a high profile actor is in the film does not warrant it to be spectacular. This is the second crap film from Leo in a row.,0
"OK, I just joined the fun. Did not know I have to fill in at least 10 lines, well so be it then. I just wanted to drag the movie down a bit since it is quite crappy. Surprisingly just a few days ago I watched the imaginarium of Dr. Panassus. How Surprising? They are both comparable, they both suck big time. They both have mediocre ideas which could have been turned into a decent movie and both failed. And actually how does a Kreisel that just keeps on spinning when you imagine it do so when you are in a dream helps you to distinguish between dream and reality when you imagine your dream to be reality and you therefore can not imagine the Kreisel to keep on spinning for that is not possible in reality? And how come you exist in three different dream levels and the time is managed in the way the director invented it, how good timing then that you wake up in all three levels at precisely the same point of time, I mean that is fine planning if you ask me. But then, being able to be shot at for a felt 20 minutes while sitting in van and not being hit seems also unlikely. So maybe they did dream it all up to be precisely the way it went. I guess then the Japanese guy was not to good at dreaming, stupid dream tourists. All in all I did like something about the movie (therefore 3 stars) but I do not remember what it was.",0
"I am not going to discuss any particular event or reveal the beginning or ending to this two and a half hour ear & butt buster . However , I will warn anyone from walking into the theater unaware of what the storyline is about . I saw Shutter Island and really enjoyed DiCaprio's performance despite some negative reviews it got from professional critics . ...... So I paid my $12 bucks and bought a ticket for Inception and walked in without knowing what to expect . I thought this film would be more of a psychological thriller but I was mistaken . I found myself trying to play catch-up with this confusing plot from start to finish . I remember seeing people floating around in zero gravity, machine guns blazing , bombs exploding , buildings collapsing , numerous car crashes , and lots and lots of chase scenes , fights, falls, and natural disasters . Just about everything you would expect to see in any big budget summer action flick . By the time this long movie ended I couldn't have cared less . As I exited the theater I looked at the faces of my fellow movie goers . No one commented on how good it was or how much it stunk . They just looked relieved this unnecessarily long nightmare was over and quietly left . Most people here who took the time to review this picture apparently were not disappointed as I was . So I guess I'm in the minority of unhappy of Inception reviewers . If I could re-edit this movie I would 1) Chop off one hour . 2) Remove all dialog . 3) Speed up the film . 4) Change the soundtrack to that of The Benny Hill Show . ......... The next time I feel in need of another nightmare adventure I think I'll take an Ambien and hop in my clothes dryer .. I gave this movie a 4 because of some really good special effects ... ( Not so Hot ) ... P.W.H.",0
"I doubt anybody will read this review, since it's neither a ""fan rave"" nor a ""hated it."" The movie gets four stars from me primarily because the CGI is not as bad as most other recent movies and Leo actually does some decent work. (Gordon-Levitt is also quite good, but he's canceled out by Ellen Page, who is, as usual, barely tolerable and not at all believable in her role.) Frankly, I just don't get the hype over ""Inception"" as metaphor, and it sure doesn't impress me as being a truly deep or complex movie. It's more like the level of the well-known character explaining how our solar system could actually itself be an atom, with the sun as the nucleus, etc.Actually, I take that back...it IS a complex movie. Needlessly complex, I might add. The whole set of rules for entering into (and out of) someone's dreams are so ridiculously complex that they obviously exist only to set up the action sequences. Unfortunately, this makes it necessary for all the characters to explain them to each other throughout most of the movie. (Why is this? If they're professionals at doing this sort of thing, why do they all need to have it explained to them each time? That's like reminding a soldier how to take the safety off his weapon just before exiting the personnel carrier.) Furthermore, the dream world is not dream-like. It's more like the virtual world of ""Tron."" If I were shown the action sequences with no exposition, I'd guess that the characters were in a virtual world, or in another dimension, but not in a dream.Finally, in spite of some good performances, I didn't give a lickspittle about the characters. What they are doing (or attempting to do) is immoral and unethical. And what risks they face are basically virtual as well. Who gives a flip? There's no redemption, no character development, no introspection (at any substantive level), and what you're left with is a mixture of pop psychology and ""the solar system itself may just be an atom."" This may be a good film on some levels, but I didn't care for it.",0
"I don't actually consider this to be an awful film but felt that a note of restraint should be applied to the gushing superlatives thus far enjoyed by a film that simply doesn't deserve them.It is a decent story reasonably well told. The direction is intelligent but probably led by the nose by a script that more or less demands sensational action sequences and often contrived drama and emotion.Leonardo DiCaprio coasts through the film with a perfunctory performance which left me caring little about his character. The supporting cast, again, perform well enough but do nothing out of the ordinary.The special effects are spectacular and beautifully choreographed but one can't help feeling that this is why many younger reviewers were seduced so successfully.It is a good film and certainly entertaining but, at times, it was muddled and from time to time one couldn't help thinking, 'why don't they just use hypnosis' or some other suggestive technique. It seemed to be a long way to a short cut.I am perhaps being churlish in that respect since one ought to suspend belief to a degree when watching this sort of simplistic, banal sci fi fairy tale. One reviewer reckoned that this was up there with 'The French Connection' or 'The Godfather'. It is a long, long way short of that.",0
"This is a totally incomprehensible movie. Unlike other jigsaw puzzle movies of today this one doesn't come together at all. There is no excitement since you can't understand what is going on anyway. There is no emotional connection with the characters since its just a mess. One scene just moves to another without any explanation or logic. I concentrated as hard as I could and it didn't make any sense at all. Even if I watched it another 3 times I still wouldn't understand it.Ellen Page looks like she was plucked from Junior high and thrust in the middle of the Matrix. Cotillard is out of place too. Even Leonardo and Gordon Levitt don't seem enthusiastic at all. Don't waste your time just because Leonardo is in it. This is his worst movie ever. This may be one of the worst movies ever period. You don't learn anything, feel entertained, laugh, cry or feel any excitement at all. The only things you feel are bewilderment and confusion and frustration. The praise - its just the Emperor's new clothes. The box office? Just the blind leading the blind.",0
"This movie seems to be Matrix with a cheap twist. There was too much effort trying to make the movie ""complex"" and less on trying to build a plot. I find that people love this movie because it has the false appearance of one that is confusing when in reality it is fairly easy to follow. People tend to like the pseudo-intelligent boost in being able to follow a simple movie with the false appearance of being complex.Southpark put it best in their take on it*:Sharon: Just because an idea is over convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool. Going into multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea. Cobb: You don't get it because you're not smart enough.*(Season 14 Episode 10 - Insheepsion)",0
"Yes, this means better then star wars? better then Aliens, better then the matrix, even better then 2001: a space odyssey, OK stop! If this is the way we are going with Scifi, just stop making scifi movies. This movie reminds me to much about taxes (in taxes, in taxes, in taxes) How can someone think that a movie, where people are killed in dreams, is the best scifi ever made? How is it possible that i find countless of review pages here with people that rate the movie below average and still be the best scifi ever? This movie is a shame for the scifi scene overall. almost fell asleep from this.I specially had to make an account here just to vent my frustration about this film.",0
"Well, I have to agree with this site, which came up when I was searching for Inception: ""Inception' wins informal poll as most overrated movie of 2010."" I just don't get it. This is what I saw (fortunately for only $4.99 on On Demand):Great special effects, but mostly in the beginning of the movie. An interesting psychological plot about manipulating a guy's mind. An incredibly long middle sequence where one guy is moving around unconscious bodies, interspersed with equally incredibly boring scenes of shooting and fighting on a mountain - why in the world was all that necessary? Without the hour or more spent on this totally unnecessary footage, it would be have been a much better movie. We almost killed ourselves when they showed the first shot of the van and it had JUST started falling. I guess the director took the idea of 5 minutes real time/1 hour dream time painfully literally. A plot with a guy and his wife that is (SPOILER ALERT) totally predictable if you saw Shutter Island or Memento, or took Psych 101. A cast that acted reasonably well, but whose characters I didn't care at all about.So I don't get why it's so popular. I think I would have liked it a lot more if it had been ruthlessly edited down to an hour and a half, and if the wife plot had been something different for a change. I'm getting tired of that one.I know I'll get a lot of screaming comments from fans who don't believe anyone should have a different opinion than they do, but I'd like to see anyone justify that long middle sequence.",0
"there are some great ideas that blow your mind when you first see them on screen. in the inception genre, matrix did that. it was fresh and left an impact long after one had seen the movie. great plot, screenplay, direction, editing... the 'dream' idea had that potential but inception hardly does justice to it. the plot is not engaging, it's confusing. the action sequences are lame and clichéd and hardly grab you. there are some nice special effects but for them you don't need to see the movie, the trailer is enough. i wonder what's wrong with movie watchers. they have played right into the hands of the marketing team and bought the hype. rather than using their own sensibilities, i think they are too embarrassed to call a lemon a lemon, fearing 'how can i call it bad when everyone is going ga ga over it.' a below average movie, rated highly by below average audience.",0
"Went to see this film recently and was very disappointed. I was expecting something amazing given the extremely high IMDb rating - couldn't have been more disappointed with this movie.The special effects were good, but apart from that, I think the film didn't work particularly well and it's totally over-rated.The acting was nothing amazing and the story is not as clever as it pretends to be. I agree with some other reviewers on here, that this film passes itself off as being very intelligent and clever but only for people who don't have any intelligence and are easily pleased.I like Nolan's other work - Dark Knight was excellent, however, this movie is nowhere near as good and felt pretty lame.I think a lot of people who don't even understand this movie, just gave it a high rating assuming it was a clever movie when it actually wasn't that good at all.This movie is certainly 'not' a masterpiece or anything even close. It felt like a Matrix wannabe, but I have to say The Matrix blows this movie out of the water by a huge margin.As I write this review, this movie is currently in the top 3 movies of all time?? I've never been more shocked - get real people. It seems the film companies are paying people to vote on here and boost their films - there can be no other explanation. Very disappointing and was expecting so much more from this movie. Don't bother paying to see it in the cinema as you will feel let down.",0
"Q: I didn't really understand the whole movie and I fell like the only one who didn't understandA: watch it again and pay attention. it helps. Q: I did pay attention and still didn't get it maybe I missed somethingA: Read through the entire FAQ section of IMDb for the movie.---I rest my case (the above is a word-for-word excerpt from the film's IMDb message board - in case you were wondering).Possibly something like 90% of what is posted about Nolan's movies in the IMDb forum are obvious and desperate fanboys' attempts at explaining what each movie was really all about.They go to great lengths in trying to reason everyone why what seemed like plot holes weren't actually plot holes at all. Or what seemed like bad writing, directing, acting etc., was actually outstanding. It's like an engineer telling us when we complain about a p.o.s. technical gadget we just bought not working the way it's supposed to that it is actually quite easy to use: ""Here let me show you. First you press here. Then you open the menu. No, not that menu, the other menu. Then you?"" ad infinitum. If we didn't care about the characters, if we didn't care about the plot, if we didn't care about the visuals, then why would anyone with a half a brain expect anyone to suddenly view the same movie as a master piece by that one notion alone that it could have technically worked?Might these be the same guys (they are always guys, you see) who lament that their girlfriends - if they indeed have one - either can't or refuse to have an orgasm even though they themselves are technically doing everything right?Four words, homies. We. Do. Not. Care.",0
"2.5 hours of my life wasted watching this drivel. Sorry for fans of this film but I thought it was garbage. I don't like dream stories, might as well be about wizards, anything can happen, there's no reality. I don't like slo mo stuff or flying through the air. And why 2 actors as prime characters who look like children? I'm referring to Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I like them both as actors but they are supposed to be a crack team of experts, hard to believe when 2 of them look about 14 years old. They'd be great in a stoner movie or something, not in something that's meant to be serious. One of them perhaps, but both, no.",0
"OK, Inception can be the best rated movie of 2010, but not for me. I'm not questioning its quality as an action movie but yes as a sci-fi production because after The Matrix this movie seems much more illogical exactly for trying to be more realistic and fully coherent and cohesive. Also, it's impossible not compare it to The Matrix as Christopher Nolan already stated that the idea for the movie came from movies like The Matrix, The 13th Floor and The Dark City. That's so inspired by these movies - mainly The Matrix - that some references to it are a lot clear: the red and blue button in the briefcase (like the red and blue pill), the architect, a group which each one of them has an specific ability, the idea (meaning the virus), the dream soldiers (as the anti-virus), the totem (like the telephone), among others...Who pays attention to dreams or is familiar to the basics of it knows that the movie is right in some points but lacks of several other characteristics. When you're in a lucid dream you're able to control it and direct events and happenings, that's why you're able do dream a lucid dream and back to it even if you wake up for a short time. In unconscious dream you're unable to control it, that's why we mostly wake up when we die or when we fall, because in a lucid dream you're able to 'defend' yourself as you wish. The world of unconscious dream, where most of the film tries to reproduce as the characters are in a pre-coma state, is a lot more confusing and chaotic than it seems. It could have been much more explored if wasn't given so much attention for action sequences. The only time where seems like a real and chaotic dream is when a train crosses an entire street. At that moment I thought that things would be visually interesting, but it never was.Trying to give more attention for the action and not for science, the characters have a magic pack that connects several people into a dreamer's dream without reason. In The Matrix they have those huge machines that are connected in their minds to fully transfer people to a dream world previously built, making 2 or more people share the same dream space. That makes The Matrix more acceptable in this explanation than Inception. Scientists believe that sharing a dream is possible as the brain is moved by electric impulses, so, if we have a main board able to unify and decode those electric impulses, this could be possible. But in Inception what really connects them all? Just a powerful sedative? Are they super heroes or what? That's why I think that The Matrix is much more successful when exploring this idea, because it starts from a solid scientific one.While The Matrix deals with an electronic generated world, in Inception we are talking about a dream where there are cities, people, mobiles that works, explosives, car crashing, people dying and bleeding and whatever... but never the power of imagination. Work about the inception of an idea is a great plot, and the barriers for that could be anything than just a bunch of armored guys shooting and exploding everything.Inception for me is just a redone idea, the same as Avatar is to Pochahontas, but Inception doesn't give me anything new or add something interesting among other interesting ones I've seen before. The media calls it one of the best movies of 2010 and one of the best sci-fi movies of the time and that actually insults my intelligence because there's nothing new there. But the industry needs to make money from something times to times and they found Inception a great money machine. Technically the movie is superb and a great action flick, but I don't see anything more from it.I give 5 stars just as an action movie, because thinking as a sci-fi, I give it none. There's a lot for nothing... or maybe, a lot for just in the end the movie explains that incept an idea is so difficult as I trying to convince you that this movie isn't so good as it seems.",0
"I can't believe I wasted 6 dollars to see this movie at the theater. It was a waste of 2 hours and 20 minutes. I don't know why this movie got so much praise, it's a pointless sci-fi movie that should have gone straight to video. I see some reviews say this movie was better than Star Wars, you have got to be kidding. Unlike Inception Star Wars had a great story, the actors even though unknown at the time impressed me; and the special effects-WOW. I must say Star Wars blows Inception out of the water still to this day. To anyone who doesn't think so must be too young to know that it took a lot more effort in the 70's to make a great film. I was really disappointed in Inception, I thought since Nolan did The Dark Knight movies this would be another success. This movie was slow, boring and really had no plot. The only thing I took from it was it was a dreams and getting into peoples heads in there most vulnerable time while they are dreaming. The ending was a WTF ending the kind that can make or break movies, but since this on was broken from the start the ending really didn't surprise me. To all who want to see a great sci-fi movie pick up the classic, like Alein, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Equilibrium, ETC.. I know from watching these movies and being a big fan of the SW saga, you won't be disappointed. Hey BTW, looking for a great TV Mini-series blockbuster from the 80's checkout V and V-The Final Battle, these movies are classics and I would recommend them to anyone who likes a great sci-fi movie.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",0
Looking at the overall rating of 8.8 I had to write this review because in my opinion this movie does not deserve a rating of more than 5. There are so many plot holes in this movie that it really makes you wonder whether director even cared. I would not go into the details as the other reviewers have already pointed out but for me its a promise unfulfilled. I have always considered Christopher Nolan to be an amazing director but with this one he probably got confused himself or devised convenient ways to resolve plot twists. The movie does have some entertainment value but when you begin to think of the plot it leaves you with a feeling of having been cheated. I would have given it a 5 for its characters and decent graphics but the insipid linear plot line and and an undeserved rating on IMDb forces me to do my part and bring it the level where it should be.,0
"What a dreadful and tiresome movie to watch. I tried to finish it thrice but know for sure I never will. Just a mash of silly ideas wrapped around compulsory CGI with hopelessly miscast actors who looked liked they just walked off the set of an after school special.Apart from the plagiarized idea of this dream infiltration business, the storyline never rose above the grade of an 80's Bond flick. Not a likable or non cookie cutter character on screen and the constant drawn out exposition got seriously annoying even after a short while.I frankly don't think it's an exaggeration when I say that I've seen episodes of the Simpsons with a more intricate plot. And yet people are stumbling over each other commending the complexity of this brainless blockbuster action cliché. I'm not particularly thick, but for the love of God people..I best get me a towel, I'm getting off this planet.",0
"I just can't believe this movie made it to number 13 on the IMDb top 250! I've watched it twice. I didn't get the whole concept and the plot in general. Yes, the special effects are what you would expect from a movie of this caliber. The acting isn't superb. I have never liked Leonardo Dicaprio, he didn't impress me in this movie as well. No matter how old he is to me he always have that teenage look that doesn't convince me especially in serious movies like this one.The movie takes us in way too many ""dreams"" that at one point you wonder what's the reality, are the characters in a dream, or they are in present?! For the most part i was forcing my brain to figure out what's going on instead of enjoying the entertaining parts of the film. I would only give this movie 2 stars for the modernistic, high-end special effects. Definitely doesn't deserve a top spot. Not on my list!",0
"Like we had the Coen's love in, we now have the Nolan love in.This movie is in the TOP 11 movies of all time according to the masses.To be fair, I loved Nolan's 'Memento' and 'The Prestige'. I settled down to watch this in great anticipation. IMDb had it at NO.1 at the time. Better than Shawshank? Godfather? This must be something else!I can only sum this movie up in sentence.They make it up as they go along. Really. The way the 'plot' needs to be continually explained by characters is a give away. This guy's dream affects this guy but the surroundings are made by this dude this totem will work here and....come on guys. This is ridiculous. Yes, it's Sci-Fi but good vs evil on another world is more believable than this.Utterly disappointed with this movie. Get a grip fanboys. This is a movie about some dudes dreams.You can easily (as I did) tear this 'plot' to pieces in minutes. He wants to go and see his kids. He can't leave the country.Are we agreed that that's the plot?Couldn't the kids have flown out to him?Now who's the one who doesn't get it?If you've got ADHD or similar you may like it. My cat likes it when you dangle a shiny toy in front of him. He liked Inception.",0
"Can't believe the high reviews as I think it's the worst Nolan productions to date. Means: it's a good/average movie, but not great.The whole movie is just too stylistic, the romance is cold and uninteresting, the characters are one dimensional, and the whole dream thing is just too stylistic. The movie wants to be too intelligent for its own good. I preferred how dreams where presented in ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"": blurry, not cohesive stories and unpredictable.Inception used dreamworlds as a cheap way of adding car chases, shoot outs in snow. The whole dream-in-dream thing is nice but doesn't add anything to the story.The romance thingie is just annoying to watch. I just don't care. But I should.Meh.",0
"Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment.He has taken us to places we did not know existed.He singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics. In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious. The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitious.he relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal.The special effects are terrific, the acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is also good, but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes. The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience. The emotional factor is completely absent.The movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition, but it should not be an Oscar nominee. Christopher Nolan has done better work.",0
"After reading a few of the reviews on this site, we decided to watch ""Inception"", and we went with great expectations. Unfortunately, the movie was a big disappointment.The impression ""Inception"" leaves is that the director tried to squeeze as much action as possible into one movie, and it seems that it was therefore that the story was split into reality and four additional ""unreal"" dreamworlds which are displayed almost simultaneously. There is hardcore-action with aggressive special effects, fighting, killing, excessive shooting, explosions, car-chases, snowmobile-chases and the liking in every layer, and the permanent hopping from one layer to another makes this a non-stop-action-flick while the story behind all this seems to take a back seat.If one likes action and special effects, the movie might be interesting - the storytelling is poor. The plot and the technology involved are so complicated that, after a while, one gets indifferent. There is almost no identification with the main characters. In this movie, almost anything can happen, and the audience will accept it because it can't follow the story. Like this, no suspension can be built, and over two hours full of action without suspense and bad storytelling can be rather tiring.The story itself is not very clever. The setup reminds of the ""Matrix"" - the old question of what is really real. However, the idea of an powerful Asian industrial boss who hires a crew to secretly invade his competitor's brain in order to increase his own profit (and who deliberately risks his own life during the operation) is very far fetched. He could just as well shoot all of his competitors, because according to the story, the Asian boss is so powerful that he does not have to fear any governmental action. So, why invading brains, risking the own life and the life of others instead of just getting rid of the trouble by shooting it? Then, there is a weird aspect about the dreaming itself. I can imagine that everything happens inside my own dream, but to have many people dream the same dream simultaneously because they are plugged to a special device... I don't know. I am not someone who screams for logic in movies, but this was hard to take.This movie is just an action movie disguised as clever science-fiction which it is absolutely not. There are great special effects, but there are too many of them and after a while they seem to become an end in themselves. The story is badly told, and the movie leaves you with nothing to think about.",0
"The visuals in the first third of the movie are stunning. But then the story gets in the way. The multi-layered experience of the characters is so spoiled by all the crashes, shooting, and gratuitous action/violence. DiCaprio is doing a lot of weird stuff these days. See Shutter Island, for example. And he is better than this. I think this movie was made for adolescent boys. In the screening I saw they made up 2/3 of the audience. And they loved it. But I didn't hear any girls or women praising it. Altogether the cast was very good but they had little to do except go with the narrative. And it's a poor narrative. Boo.",0
"In summary, if you consider yourself a seriously thinking individual who wants more than mindless explosions, then you will be dissatisfied with this movie. It is littered with flaws.Firstly the film is amoral. All of the characters are criminals, yet in this film the audience is encouraged to like them or at least ignore their shortcomings as if what they do is nothing more than unfortunate or a product of circumstances or society. Then there is the cavalier way in which a young girl is lured into a life of crime. Hey, but it's cool, so therefore okay! No its not! I can understand and believe that a university professor would happily introduce the girl to the criminal _ basically, the professor is ""aiding and abetting"", and university lecturers are warping kids' minds to their own left-wing ideology every day, without a shred of guilt, so I can accept this professor's involvement in this perversion of the girl. But its offensive that the movie treats this as acceptable behavior. Then we are supposed to believe that DiCaprio's character can get the girl into one of his dreams without her knowledge _ how that happened is never made clear. And then when she finds out that her mind has been violated, she doesn't really seem to mind. You'd think she'd be straight to the police. But supposedly the dream world is so alluring, that she doesn't mind that what they are proposing is illegal, a violation of someone else's mind, and that she's putting her trust in a criminal who had no qualms in violating her, and who is himself, psychologically and morally corrupt. Would a supposedly well-rounded girl really be that suicidal? A troubled, tattooed girl on the streets, struggling with a drug habit, might have been a more plausible character. But a clean cut girl attending University? Hopefully society hasn't sunk to that depth yet, where a girl of that background can be corrupted so easily and her exploitation then tolerated if not celebrated by the audience.Now onto some of the other flaws. One of the main faults, was that the van was hit and penetrated by multiple bullets over an extended period of time and only one person was wounded. We kept seeing shots of the van with bullets slamming into it, yet no one else is hit _ even though the van is riddled with bullets and no panel left untouched. Most of the bullets went through the van, but in one scene a bullet hit the edge of the van door and hardly damage the paint. Some people seem to think that because it is a dream, anything can happen. So are there no rules? Wasn't the world designed in advance by the architect? Is the world supposed to be redesigned or altered in dream-time, and if so why did that guy get shot, and why couldn't he be healed instantly by the dreamer. There seemed to be many contradictions. Sometimes the worlds acted as if they were pre-defined and unalterable -- other than by the mind in whose head the dream was occurring, unconsciously fighting off the interference. But at other times the person who was dreaming seemed to be able to control everything. I'm also confused as to whose head was hosting each dream. How can a sequence of explosions in three different dreams be timed to such perfection that each goes off one after the other in sequence? Particularly without a sophisticated timing device (and when different dreams were being controlled by different people, if that was the case). DiCaprio seemed to work out the timing in his head. Nonsense. And the ski lodge scene was also unbelievable. The character was invincible, which led credence to the idea that it was his dream. But then if that was the case, why go to all of this trouble blowing up the building. The guy whose mind they were infecting, was dead or unconscious towards the end of the scene. So couldn't the dreamer just dream that the building drops off a cliff or is hit by an alien spacecraft or something equally preposterous. Since they made it so involved in causing the fall, I assume that the dreamer was limited in what they could do, and that is borne out by most of the dreams in the movie being constrained by real world consequences. So I think the dreamer was constrained as to what they could do, otherwise they wouldn't need the fuss trying to get an explosion to occur.The explosive charges weren't drilled into the reinforced concrete walls of the building, so the explosions wouldn't have destroyed the building. And then when the explosions occurred it is more likely that the upper story would have crashed down on their bodies, squashing them without any feeling of falling being involved.There are many more flaws in this movie: the Asian character that had been shot wakes up just at the right moment to lob a grenade down the tunnel; DiCaprio hasn't heard of the phone or email and so must travel the world to be his criminal cronies; there is too much shaky camera (the cinematographer hasn't heard of a steady cam; the dream within a dream concept is a rip off of the VR (virtual reality) worlds within worlds, that was done much better in the movie 13th Floor many years ago; there is none stop action that ends up being boring; we don't care about the characters or the main goal of the crime; dreams (or even memories) are presented in too much detail. My advice if you are someone who likes it when a movie hangs together, is to switch off your mind while you watch this movie and to accept that it makes little to no sense at all.",0
"I just can't believe that this movie gets a 9!!! It's pretentious, boring and 'much ado about nothing'. I thought it would be a movie as good as 'The Matrix' (the first one!), but that movie is so much better. If you like movies with a twist, try 'Blade runner', 'Moon', 'Minority report' or even 'Triangle', but skip this one. What a waste of time and talent. With that money you could make 20 or so great, personal movies. Or feed a small African country... Watching this failure really made me angry. It's an empty shell. O.k., there are some pluses: the actors do their best and some scenes look great, especially the crumbling cliffs and the 'ceiling' of buildings, but that's just not enough for a movie that lasts for 2 1/2 hours...",0
"What on earth has happened to character development in cinema? I was pretty pumped to see Inception. It looked flashy, decent actors, and what appeared to actually be a new idea for a plot (I'm REAL tired of rehashed plots).You were thrown into the film with characters that had NO basis of who they were. I didn't have a chance to decide if I liked a character through who they were. Lead actor played his usual flat self. He reminds me of the Al Pacino school of acting graduate. I didn't care anything about him or his ""team"".There were so stinkin' many visual flaws, goofs, and editing mistakes I lost count of which ones I would start with after the movie.The best thing about this movie is that I had a free pass given to me by my boss!",0
"Visually stunning but with a little bit on the inside this movie will give you exactly the same experience as The Shutter Island - previous DiCaprio's work. Tom Hardy & Cillian Murphy are the only actors who actually fit the movie. The rest of quite amazing line-up is all over the place and doesn't really suit their roles. Movie seems to focus on DiCaprio without even trying to give away any information about other characters. Now to the art work: the dreams that were created suppose to be convincing to the subject but they didn't even look that real on the screen. Artificial acting with backgrounds looks really plastic and gives away the ending right in middle of the movie. I would consider 2 hour 30 minutes is a big fail from editors and director for the amount you get from the flick. Christopher Nolan spent almost 10 years writing the screen play, but originality that he had in Memento is well overpowered by Hollywood glitter with no substance that new Batman movies are so full of. Overall, watch it if you like eye-candy movies. I bet there would be plenty fans and a lot of talk but movie just doesn't cut it for me when you know what is going to happen and there is more than an hour to go until the end.",0
"I sat through the whole thing without the least idea of what was going on. It seemed like an endless string of herky-jerky, two second scenes with next to nothing to connect them. Lots of guns and explosions for those who like fireworks, but the plot was invisible. None of the characters provoked even the mildest of interest from me. Clearly, a lot of money was spent on special effects, but because something can be done doesn't mean it should be. While I am not a writer, I seem to remember that a story should have an arc. There was nothing like that here - only a bunch of random dots. Overall, a total mess. Don't waste your money. Minus 5 stars.",0
So you can enter somebody's dream and plant an idea and then watch it develop into some big world changing decision/event. Well honestly I'd rather have telepathy to enter somebody's thoughts where I could do a whole lot more but that's not exactly what Inception is about. If I follow the story it was about planting the seed of doubt in a competitor's mind so he would sell him company or something like that. I found a lot of things in this movie pointless and how exactly can u have a dream within a dream within a dream? Isn't that like saying I'm eating a meal within a meal within a meal? Seriously if this was all the studio could come up with I'd rather watch Superman stop a bullet with his invulnerable eye again and again and again.,0
"My wife and I sat down to watch this on Sky HD in eager anticipation given the rave reviews it has been receiving from the critics and on IMDb. How disappointed we were. In our opinion, and the one star review given is an average of our two scores, rounded up to the minimum allowed of one, this has to be one of the worst films ever made. We cannot see any merit in it, on any level, from any aspect. I am not going to give away any of the film other than to say that it is nonsense from beginning to end, and when we say nonsense, that is not because we did not understand it. We understood what was happening, but all the time there was an air of absolute disbelief that anyone could consider this tripe to be entertaining. We watched it all the way to the end just to see what would would happen. We should have given up after five minutes as we considered and watched some snow melt in our garden!",0
"worst film I saw in a very long time I would have given it a 6 if it wasn't for trying to bring down the hype. It is boring & slow no story Some people told me it is a good and complicated movie. They belong to the group of dumb people who like feel as though they're intelligent This thing is in the top 3 of best movies ever ??? then I do not need to see any movie ever again they are a waste of money and time and yes I did get the plot - it is missing and for those who still want to see this movie don't worry it is not complicated A very personal idea, if I do not look at my watch during the movie it was entertaining (does not have to be good but it caught you) but during this waste of time I have seen the seconds on my watch crawl forward.",0
"I'll try to make this as short and painless as possible.Lately there have been a run of films exploring the nature of reality. But compared to THE MATRIX series, or say DARK CITY, this film can't hold a mental candle. Maybe it's because of the Christopher Nolan-DiCaprio combo, maybe because of a few very cool visual effects (like a city turned sideways or upside-down), but for the life of me I can' understand why this film is rated a 9 on IMDb. I guess this is what happens when everyone gets to rate, and ""everyone"" means...well, average film knowledge...and prejudice. Where is the OBJECTIVITY, people? The problems, you ask, as if you don't want to take my word for it? Well it put my son to sleep and darned near got me, for one. It's too long and moves too slowly, then suddenly heaps plot setups and twists on you in desperate attempt to try and make the convoluted thing make sense. Where I come from we call this bad timing. And in a film LIKE this, well, that's not a good thing. The script is terrible. Even Leonardo's acting is not up to his usual par, the little girl cast as the architect was too wrong, and on the whole this film is just not believable. That some actually say this is Leonardo's best work is troubling to me on so many levels.Just because you make a bus fall off a bridge in slow motion shouldn't give you Oscar mentionings, you would think.Terrible waste of millions, I gotta say, I being an admirer of both the genre and Leonardo. But, again, don't take my word for it; watch it for free somehow (don't spend hard-earned money on this dog, for sure), then let me know where I have gone wrong. I give it a 5 only because of the effects I mentioned (not unique in film, but well-done) and the A-1 supporting performance by Joe Levitt. HE did what he could, after all.",0
"I voted this 1 out of 10, (not because it deserves it, it's probably a 4 or 5 to be fair), but because I wanted to protest at this rising to number 3 in the top 250 of all time. YOU MUST BE JOKING, RIGHT? This is a better film than Pulp Fiction? The usual suspects? The good, the bad and the ugly? One flew over the cuckoo's nest? Bladerunner? Have these people even seen those films? Do they honestly place these films below this Emperor's new clothes? Character development? Virtually nil. Suspense? Not much. Plot, OK, but I really didn't care about most of these people at the end. Visually interesting in parts, at least! I won't be buying this on DVD - one viewing was more than enough for me! See it by all means, but, DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!",0
"Inception: the story of corporate agents who trap their mark in an engineered ""dream world"" that's oddly dreary yet deafening, populated with nasty soulless projections, in which minutes seem like hours or decades, all just to rob the mark - and just when it feels the nightmare's about to end, you just find yourself in a nightmare within the nightmare. This pretty much sums up the audience experience.I found Inception uninteresting, too long, and absolute work to watch. While the premise was great, and the plot at least interesting, the writing, plot sequence, and execution were poor. And even the cinematography was greatly disappointing. You'd think a deliberately constructed dream world would be fantastic - it was merely drear, deafeningly loud, bland, stark, and depressing - even when it was monumental, it had a decidedly Stalinist architectural quality. I realize that people (supposedly) dream in black-n-white ... but did they have to make almost everything grey and dingy? Virtually all of the ""fantastic"" clips shown in the trailers happen in the first 30 minutes. In the great (70+ minute) finale the only visually interesting and original bit is the 0-gravity fight-scene as the hall tumbles around them.The climax seemed interminable, but ceased to be suspenseful about 10 minutes in. All the supporting cast - with the arguable exception of Caine - were complete ciphers, mere 2-dimensional shadows you couldn't give a damn about. The descent into dream Limbo to rescue their employer made no sense given what was explained about the nature of dream invasions: just whose dream were they entering? It was not DiCaprio's character's, so why are they stuck in his deep subconscious? ... unless of course it was all really just his nightmare to begin with.In the end, the whole movie only makes sense if it really is all the main-character's unending nightmare. Unfortunately, it proved a nightmare for me. I know thousands of brain-dead, hype-fed, viewers who imagine themselves intelligent and deep, felt differently. But my actual nightmares are more interesting, less painful to endure, and considerably cheaper.",0
"What a disappointment. The idea of thought and dreams and the subconscious being manipulated was so interesting and they took it and made it into one of the most boring films I've ever seen! That I guess was clever. Watching it (and listening to the overblown soundtrack trying to make up for the utter lack of anything actually happening on the screen) was almost as annoying as reading the overblown reviews. Is somebody's mother getting people to log in and say ""wow"".It really is mind boggling that this movie was so well received. It is long, loud, confusing, and devoid of story. Talk about a paradox.",0
"I have given this one star because the high rating this movie had is out of all proportion. There are myriads of far better films with lower scores. Let's get this score down.I have the impression that this movie started with a script which had a couple of scenes in the middle, and it was then written further to extend it to a beginning and an end. The mystery is why anyone bothered to try to have a coherent script in the first place. Plot? we don't need no stinkin plot. The basic idea of such movies is to show stunning visual and auditory effects, have characters hurtling along, mouthing dialog not meant to be coherent or even perceptible. Show em the technology, wind the characters up and get them moving-fast! Have Whoosh, whoosh, bam, bang sound effects and music to match, get a name star, and advertise the predictable and unchallenging goop as a transcendental experience.This one was interesting in places because of the visual tricks. Otherwise, I had trouble following it at times, as much because I couldn't care less about what was a dream or reality, whose dream we were in, or why this or that was happening. Explanations of the arbitrary dream rules (excuses to do various things) were the most transparent gobble-de-gook imaginable.Nothing in here had a dream like quality. The dream excuse was a gimmick to do things like play with gravity, time, etc.It is just another mindless action movie, just longer and with fancy justification. As such it is not bad-but not good.",0
"I was really looking forward to watching this movie after all the positive reviews, the incredibly high IMDb rating and the raving of several friends who had seen it.I will point out that I liked The Matrix, Memento, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight (although this last movie is quite overrated on IMDb). I also understood the plot of Inception from the start and never had any trouble following what was happening so it's not that I didn't ""get it"".Inception is NOT a great movie and not even a very good one. The plot is not very clever or inventive contrary to what many IMDb raters have suggested and there are no interesting or surprising twists. The characters are poorly developed and, as the viewer, I didn't really care what happened to them. There are no true ""bad guys"" to root against (all the bad guys are just ""bad"" dreams) and there is no real desire to see the ""good guys"" succeed because the object of the entire plot seems irrelevant (implant a thought in some guy's head so he will break up his father's corporation... I kid you not!). The fact that everything happens in dreams removes the sense of danger and risk from all the action and makes it seem like a pointless video game, which is what several of the dreams appear to be anyway... unimaginative and repetitive. Are all Nolan's dreams just ""shoot'em up"" video games? The attack of the hospital/mountain fortress was as bad as it gets... looked like a CGI sequence from Medal of Honor/Call of Duty.It was also infuriating to me that the rules of the dream universes are inconsistent. Creating an imaginary situation where normal rules don't apply is OK as long as the alternate universe functions according to logical rules, but in this movie the rules are constantly bent to accommodate the needs of the director.A few examples: The top is supposed to be an indication to Mal that she is in ""her own dream"" if the top spins forever because she has made it that way... If she is in someone else's dream then the top will topple since they don't know that in her dreams the top spins forever. So how does that indicate to Dom/the viewer that he is/is not in a dream/reality in the end scene?... but wow, that is sooo deep.How did finding the top in the safe allow Dom to ""incept"" Mal with the idea that she was in a dream and needed to return to reality? No explanation... but wow, that is sooo deep.In dream No.1 the van falls off the bridge causing weightlessness in dream No.2 - meaning that non-physical events (it's a dream) of a certain kind(?) carry through between dream layers. In dream No.2 the sleeping characters become weightless but somehow this state does not carry through to layer No.3 and No.4... but it's a dream anyway so who cares if it makes sense?Why do you need a ""kick"" in each layer to wake up the characters? if weightlessness carries through the layers the ""kick"" would logically also carry through... If there was some logic to the rule wouldn't it be that only actual physical events in the real world carry through to the dreams? But in your dream you are aware that there is another reality - which is really another dream - so you dream that can feel the effects of the other dream although you are asleep and unaware of what's going on... but wow, that is sooo deep.If a character is asleep in the first layer of a dream he does not know what is happening to him after he has fallen asleep thus would have no reason to dream that he is becoming weightless in layer two as he sleeps through the falling van dream... but wow, that is sooo deep.Since the wake-up ""kicks"" are supposed to come through sensation in the inner ear and the ""kicks"" are not real but dreams, then I have to conclude that the inner ear must ""dream"" that it senses the imaginary kicks, which makes no sense at all... but wow, that is sooo deep. So as you analyze the logic behind the dream rules you must conclude that the entire movie is just a dream (a nightmare) where no logic applies or that the ""dream rules"" are just nonsense and the whole movie is a pretext for stringing together a bunch of unrelated ""cool"" action sequences and special effects to make a massive Hollywood ""pseudo-intellectual"" blockbuster junk movie. This movie was an even the greater disappointment considering that I was anticipating something better than ""The Matrix"" or ""The Sixth Sense"". The IMDb rating of 9+ is incomprehensible, this should rate in the 6.0-7.0 range. The rating must reflect a large number of users getting confused and rating it as a video game.As for those who say the number of positive votes/reviews indicate it is a great movie I think you could likewise argue for McDonald's being the best food in the world.I rated it a very harsh 1.0 only to help bring the IMDb rating back to earth. It is however a very mediocre movie.",0
"It's a heist movie with a banal twist, placement rather than extraction. Forget Sigmund Freud and Lewis Carroll. Dreams are misconceived as just a version of reality with some CGI tricks and so we move through conceptual layers rather than anything that might reasonably be passed off as subconscious states. Any ambiguity about what is real and what is dream merely has us guessing about whether any of Nolan's crafted layers of so called consciousness actually matter at all beyond supplying opportunity for clever-clever editing sleight of hand gimmickry.To See Cobb (Di Caprio) and Mal (Cotillard)poncing about in their mental construct with a hand wave that its ordinariness is due to their fondness for modernist architecture (serial reiterations of skyscrapers worthy of a Hanna-Barbera loop)puts paid to any claim that we are witnessing the like of surreality we visit in our sleep. Dreams in this film are nothing but different locations arrived at by means of taking a pill. We sure don't get to see Wonderland.All this leads us to wonder about the entire premise which turns out to be nothing more than a bunch of corporate malarkey. Absorption into the plot rather depends on the audience buying into the elaborately technical internal logic about who has to be where and doing what in various levels of a subject's mind to perform the exercise at hand. That's your mission should you accept it.So if you happen to swallow the director's pill at the outset then Nolan's fake world will draw you in -James Bond's Impossible Oceans Infinity. Take the pill that powers your critical judgment and for a couple of ours you'll find yourself staring at some overblown money drain that invites you to consider the deception that marketing and production gloss can pull off.",0
"Okay, maybe this movie isn't awful. It's closer to mediocre, but I just can't resist the urge to lower its over-inflated rating.To be fair, Inception has a strong cast, inventive CGI, and an interesting premise. Nonetheless, the film ends up being surprisingly tedious and unaffecting. Images rush across the screen as jargon-rich dialogue whisks pasts your ears. The film's methodical score swells and swells until you can barely make out what the characters are saying. It's all so complex, but complex like a brainteaser or a riddle. If you concentrate very hard, you can decode the film's narrative trick of dreams within dreams within dreams within, well you get the idea, and multiple action sequences all taking place at once in parallel dreamscapes.But, what do you get for all of your narrative attention? Very little. The story is gimmicky and the characters are flat: you just don't care what happens to them. In fact, when watching this film, I did not feel as if I were watching characters navigate a story world. Instead, I felt like I was watching movie stars speak difficult dialogue while performing stunts.By the way, any movie that can make Joseph Gordon-Levitt seem less than fascinating must have something wrong with it. If you do not believe me, then watch Manic, Mysterious Skin, or The Lookout. Then marvel at Inception's ability to mask_ or at the very least waste_ his considerable talent.As for the movie's imagery, it is initially striking. Then, like the movie's narrative trope_ a dream within a dream within a dream_ it becomes simply repetitious. Whose dreams look so leaden and dull? And whose dreams are so relentlessly consistent and coherent? There are so many good movies that replicate the bizarre visual logic of dreams-- Vertigo, Badlands, The Last Wave, Videodrome, Blue Velvet, Until the End of the World. Has director Christopher Nolan ever seen any of these movies? Has he ever even had a dream? In short, Inception delivers some new cinematic tricks, but lacks emotional depth or provocative imagery. It's a notch above Hollywood's typical comic book based summer extravaganza, but only a notch.",0
"I think you are all DREAMING. I tried to watch this film FIVE, YES FIVE times and just didn't get it. Too convoluted, no character development, bizarre jumping from one scene to the next without a common thread or context. I have an exceptionally high IQ, and frankly, felt I was watching ""special effects gone wild"". Please, bring back the art of true film making with great scripts, outstanding acting, real characters and a plausible storyline.I felt this film was pointless, without direction and a total waste of talent! Nolan did an excellent job with The Dark Knight; this film is a disaster.",0
"Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and Memento & The Dark Knight are my favourite movies but for the first time I am disappointed with his movie Inception. The film is all about is all about stealing & planting ideas in people's mind by using their dreams.The idea of the movie is good but the bad screenplay, 2.5 hours length that drags really badly, plot holes & unanswered questions & Cobb's annoying wife ruined the whole movie.Inception is supposed to be a movie that requires multiple views to understand it like Memento but there is no way I will watch it again for the second time because it wasn't that confusing and it boring throughout. The dream sequences were not dreamlike and only the hotel dream looked cool. Cobb's wife was so annoying that I wanted to pull my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. There were so many unanswered questions like what year is the movie set in? Why does Cobb steal ideas and now he has to plant one? It was 2.5 hours long and they still couldn't explain anything.Inception isn't even original it is ripped off from a Japanese animated movie called ""Paprika"" which was out in 2006.I don't know why it is #3 on the IMDb top 250 it is not a visionary masterpiece or anything and it is only about 80% on rotten tomatoes and there are many great movies with 90+% on rotten tomatoes and they are not on the top 250 like Run Lola Run.It is nothing but an over hyped movie and the film makers must of written that ""Inception is good"" on a piece of paper and planted it in people's mind although it's not.",0
"I can't believe the favourable reviews this movie gets...the movie has no sense of coherence, terrible plot, very dubious arguments, and only slightly salvageable performances by the main actors... i am a huge fan of SciFci/thriller/philosophical movies but this one is so mediocre that the comparisons to the Matrix series is simply insulting to anyone with single digit IQs who watched them. Seriously, the movie is horrible.. Being a huge movie fan I can stand all genres of movies and all qualities, good and bad...And out of the 1000+ movies (i watch 50+ movies a year since i've been a teenager) I've watched in my lifetime this movie was going to become only the 3rd movie to cause me to walk out of the theatre... The only two movies i ever walked out of were (yes, i remember b/c they were THAT bad): The Lawnmower Man and The Avengers (with Ralph Fiennes)...So yes, Inception is almost AVENGERS bad...you get the idea... I didn't walk out just b/c i was killing time for a later date.",0
"I rarely post but felt the need after seeing the rave reviews on this film that I clearly disagree with. I felt obligated to vote to bring this score down to reality. I've read the terms benchmark, intelligent, masterpiece and greatest ever. After seeing the movie I find those terms and the current rating of 9.2 insulting. Yes for some reason I feel personally insulted by this. Is this because I was expecting the world after the great reviews and was truly disappointed? Was it the fact that I believe most feel the movie wasn't that great but are jumping on the bandwagon? I'm not the most intelligent individual in the world and can't understand how anyone intelligent could actually enjoy the story line with so many obvious holes. All I know is these layers upon layers of poor plots left a sour feeling in my mouth. I've read the comment and agree this is 'a smart movie for ignorant people'. They do say ignorance is bliss. Keep rating this ten you smart folk.Overrated, unengaging and far too long (let me scream that from the roof tops) are my thoughts. I paid top dollar to view this in my lovely electric reclining leather chair being waited on hand a foot in a 'gold class' cinema and I wanted to escape the comfort of my chair after 30 minutes. Long and painful movie experience. I urge you to filter through the positive reviews and read some well articulated negative responses. I have chose to keep this post short and sweet and leave the well articulated responses to the well articulated (lord knows every second person here thinks they are a literary genius). I really did want to post a 1 out of 10. I am a realist though and I have seen worse films. On a positive note Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were great. They boosted my score from a one to a three. Leo and Joseph finally went through went through puberty and were believable as adults. Give me back the 148 minutes of my life wasted watching this film.",0
"I should warn you that the material you're going to see is of commercial nature, especially the way those shiny computerized tricks make you wonder about the inherent nature of your being, your life( probably same as characters) and in this weird piece of crap, dreams which are the very thought-provoking world of unknown elements. I have read a lot on dreams and will tell this with certainty that their efforts to humanize the screenplay are all in vein however taking advantage of pseudo-isochromatic charts. Are we really expected to take shots like this seriously? I can no longer ignore my feeling that we are close to the end of rich cinematic era. As a matter of fact in many situations, being monotone is better than having bad intonation. The worst is when someone goes up and down too much on every word or idea, examples of which can easily be seen in Nolan's Inception which is no longer a commencement, I dare say. I remember a quote cited by a friend in IMDb which goes like: True art is not domineering, It woos you. 1 for bothering reminding me of the likelihood of words meaning not exactly what they are supposed to. Those who rate above 1 ain't seen anything yet.",0
"I'm trying very hard to be fair here. Given my high expectations and all the praise, it's hard not to bite back. So I'll temper my initial review (""Sitting through Inception was more disappointing and more frustrating than discovering my first girlfriend was cheating on me"") with this one: ""Inception buried everything that I might have loved about it 10 feet under things that were terrible.""What I hoped for: Dreaming as an exploration of character, plumbing the depths of people's imagination to discover their secrets and find out who they truly are. Dreaming as journey through fantasy: impossible landscapes, surreal physics. Something that might exist at the intersection of The Matrix, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and August Strindberg's A Dream Play.And I trusted Nolan to deliver. In Memento and The Prestige, he gave himself a unique set of rules for telling a story and used them magnificently. In his Batman films, he found humanity amid tense action and explored deeper themes than you usually expect from a franchise blockbuster.What we got: Exposition, exposition, exposition, bad action, bad action, bad action, wisps of story (and mostly the wrong story). Oh, and a lot of decently talented actors who never stopped being decently talented actors to become their characters (by my count, only two people had any motivation for their actions).I've been asleep before so I didn't expect to need a primer on dreaming. But no, movie dreaming is full of rules. Roughly the first hour of Inception is dedicated to cataloging these: what happens when you die, how much time passes while you dream (mind you it changes when you have a dream inside a dream), differences between imagined and remembered places, the types of sedatives you need, how you know you're asleep, etc etc etc.This becomes especially frustrating because many of the dream physics are quickly superseded by different dream physics. For instance, we're first told one thing happens when you die in a dream (which is important to establish a character's motivation), but then later we're told something else entirely will happen (because the movie would have had even less sense of danger if dying wasn't bad for our protagonists). Not only that, but some of these dream rules are nothing but Chekhovian peashooters- existing only to set up a single action later in the film.To be completely fair, bits of this exposition take place against the backdrop of a gorgeous and surreal dreamscape (one of only two moments where dreaming feels magical).Where was that sense of surreal dream non-reality distinctly lacking? The action sequences, which account for another hour of the movie.There are two ways, in my estimation, to make action scenes exciting. The first one requires you to make the audience genuinely uncertain whether the protagonists can prevail. This is no easy task. Usually, it necessitates breaking narrative conventions so your audience can't figure out the plot points in advance. If we're at the one hour mark and a couple armed goons pop up, then you've got to work damn hard to convince me they can actually hurt the protagonist. Maybe you had a different experience with Inception, but I never held my breath when the guns came out.The second way to make action scenes worthwhile is to make the action itself so damn fun or engrossing that the audience doesn't care if it can predict the ending. I know Bruce Lee is going to win his fight, but I'll watch it for the choreography. I've seen Wesley outfence Inigo a dozen times, but the quips could fuel dozens more viewings. There's no question that Axe Cop is going to kill the bad guys, but did I expect him to do it by hurling a baby with a unicorn horn? No. No I did not.This is one of the failures of Inception for me. There's so much combat, but it all devolves into tired clichés (with the notable exception of some of Gordon-Levitt's scenes- the only other moment where I experienced anything dream-like). I always felt that the writers failed to exploit the infinite creative possibility available to characters like Neo and Hal Jordan, but dodging bullets and firing green blobs seems downright inspired next to Nolan's dream goons with their AK-47s.So one hour of exposition, one hour of bad action, what's left? Half an hour of story or, rather, two stories. One story is about a business man wanting to steal from another business man in a convoluted way. Or something. I didn't care because the business men lacked any motivation and they kept getting in the way of what should have been the only story: unraveling Cobb's secrets.What might have been: I've hated movies before and I'm not normally inclined to write reviews for them. So what's different here? Well, it's frustration that this could have been amazing when it was truly awful.The premise has legs- sturdy, exciting legs. Dreaming is often a magical experience. Lucid dreaming, when it happens, is even more magical, giving your rational brain the freedom to play in an irrational world. Lucid dreamers sharing a dream? Fantastic. Lucid dreamers trespassing in dreams with weaponized imaginations? I don't know how you could ruin that premise.And there was the kernel of something good in there- not just hallway good, but really damn good. I cared about Cobb's story. I wanted to watch Cobb's story. Unfortunately, two hours and fifteen minutes of terrible movie got in the way of Cobb's story.",0
"First of all, why didn't DiCaprio asked Alfred the butler to fly in his kids to meet him, if he isn't allowed to enter the United States? Money doesn't seem to be the problem here. This is a big plot hole that makes his entire quest unneccesssry. Just live somewhere else together!The biggest problem I have with this movie is that it isn't 'intelligent' at all. It's a novel idea, yes, but the execution isn't that intelligent. Basically we are told many rules (the bath tub, the architect, dream in dream time, the token, and much more) but it all ends up being an ordinary action flick with cheap chases, e.g ski scene, shooting bad guys chasing in the city, floating people fighting each other, and so forth. 
Nothing really interesting is done with architecting and manipulating environments in dreams, building 'mazes' and the actual 'incepting'. It's like introducing a 10-man band with cool musical instruments and amazing musicians, and then only stick to playing basic children songs. Nolan tends to forget the ""show don't tell"" rule, an issue also present in Interstellar.",0
"...then perception becomes reality, I guess.BUT, I would like to throw my vote in with those whose brains continued to function beyond the slick promotions for this film, beyond the hype-machine that this film managed to become, beyond the silly ""word of mouth"" that the awestruck, dumbstruck numb-skulls of social media spewed forth.This movie was, first and foremost, B-O-R-I-N-G. Nothing, not one single thing, was ever at stake or in danger of being lost. This is not a movie about some depressed guy's journey toward redemption or retirement or whatever - it's about corporate espionage, first and foremost. That always gives ME the shivers! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz And no, Leo's consciousness or sanity or whatever was never really in danger. Nope. Sure, he was still in the dream. No, you shouldn't care. It doesn't matter. Why? It was a dream. A dream. JUST a dream.That leads me to my second point: if there is this amazing technology that (1) lets people consciously dive in and share a mutual dream, and (2) lets there be so much control that it can even be designed in minutest detail, then (3) Leo won't stay trapped in his dream because you can always design a way to go in and drag him back out.The magical mutual dream device is so patently absurd that there isn't even a single second's attempt to explain it - it just is what it is. We're supposed to accept it at face value. That's the director leading us down the road to accepting Leo's fate at face value, too. It's a classic trick of narrative conditioning.Anyway, just for the sake of argument, what if they couldn't design him back out of the dream? What's the deal with the totem? That thing was an arbitrary failsafe. Why is it the *only* failsafe? Are we really expected to buy that? When something as important as your consciousness on the line? There's no backup plan for figuring out what state you're in? Whaaaaaaaaat???But, back to my main point: B-0-R-I-N-G.And why didn't they shoot the wife every single time she showed up? Are you kidding me? If they would've done that, I might have stayed interested and been willing to swallow the rest. Leo has to deal with the pain of loss over and over because his teammates have brains and balls and cap that lady before she can do her damage, and Leo goes all Jack Nicholson by the end. THAT would've been something to see.This movie, though, was not something to see.If you do want to see real 9 out of 10 stars movie about dreams, go watch Paprika (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851578/), which of course doesn't get 9/10 on this site. But every vote counts!!",0
"Style over Substance might be a Knee-Jerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film. But that would be Kind. There is no Style or Substance to Waste many Brain-Cells Considering. The Movie's Conceit is to make You want to Think. Think Not.It tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams (don't do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned, you will be dead by intermission). Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams ""Method"" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given. The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen. What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a Dreamscape.If you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride, better fasten your Seat-Belts because it is anything but Smooth. It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos. The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and Intrusive.In the End, some have trouble making it that far, there is a ""you decide"" Twist that is not really a Twist because, after all, You Decide. But it is hardly Worth it and when all is Said and Done, too much has been Said and not enough has been Done. Vastly Overrated.",0
"....the sound of bullets pouring through the cab or the van they were in. The movie has nice actors, it's too long, and your eyes might start rolling the fourth or fifth time they explain the rules to you. it's watchable mostly because it looks good in stretches. There is a memorable city-falling-into-the-sea moment late in the movie that felt a little like Planet of the Apes meets Dark City. And...the action is just silly at times. Give me all the dream levels you want but if the bad guys are going to miss that badly that often maybe you could suggest to me that the bullets are missing because they want them to miss. I mean, one of the good guys got to fire a grenade launcher simply because he wished it were so. But then why bother to run at all? Take your time, the traffic downtown is bad all hours of the dream day. So bullets do matter in these dreams, as the deadly powerful yet instantly trustworthy Japanese guy who wants to create the world's largest (publicly owned/traded?...what's their symbol on the Nikkei?) energy company gets shot and we have to live with his chest wound for half the movie. It might have been an amusing Groundhog Day/Highlander scenario if they had all been continuously turned into swiss cheese and brought out of it to plan and try again. Ellen Page could have drawn up some more pleasant cityscapes using a charcoal pencil. That was a nice airy studio they were in.",0
"Having read a couple of glowing initial critics' reviews for this movie, I ventured out to catch Inception on its opening weekend. I wouldn't call myself a regular movie-goer and I usually prefer to wait and get some positive feedback on a movie before I invest my time and money. I felt confident that Inception would be worth both. I was wrong. This movie is so heavy on confusing, superficial action, yet void of any emotional connection, that it's difficult to remain attentive to it. Fortunately, even though the movie is overly long at 2.5 hours, the initial scenes give you an indication pretty early on whether it is your kind of movie or not. If you can grasp the first 15-20 minutes or so, and like what you see, then you may enjoy the movie or at least find it somewhat intriguing; if not, I can assure you it doesn't get any better, and you will feel confused and jilted by the end. I won't go into the plot - that has been delved into and debated in numerous previous reviews; suffice it to say, it's very convoluted, ""layered"" and needs your rapt attention. Nothing really, in my mind, stands out as being its saving grace. The acting is adequate but, again, the characters are not developed to the point where you really have any feelings for their ultimate fates. The special effects, save for the hallway zero gravity fight scene, are nothing out of the ordinary. The movie jumps around a lot, and DeCaprio's reoccurring interaction with his late wife is particularly annoying and confusing (what's a dream and what's reality?). I left the theatre wondering what all the buzz was about, although the majority of attendees at my showing had the same reaction as myself. I came home and checked out this site and, again, wondered what the heck I was missing in this movie that made it so spectacular,a ""masterpiece"" according to some. Now, a couple of weeks later, I see more realistic and accurate reviews and am gratified to know that I am neither insane nor stupid. This movie is obviously geared demographically to a youthful audience and/or those who consider themselves aficionados of this genre. I honestly think some have talked themselves into believing all the hype about this movie. Personally, I'm just relieved to know that I am not that far off the mark about this film. I'm going to check back again in about a month to see where this movie stands and I have no doubt it will have dropped off the radar altogether.",0
"This movie does not come close to Matrix I. It is sad that this is ranked so highly in the IMDb list.This simply is an action movie. A decent one, maybe, but there are so many movies like this, really. Perhaps one difference is that this movie has some philosophical side to it (albeit junior high school level, ""what if all of this is a dream?"" type). I wonder why the thousands of viewers who gave a 10 to this movie liked this movie so much. Are those guys all from the UK :) ?! I was also bothered by the multitude of inconsistencies in the movie. For example, the husband and wife spend 50 years in the dream, which means that they must be in a third or higher level dream, which should require according to the movie a heavy chemical that prevents waking up from it in case of death. But they commit suicide and that wakes them up instead of sending them to Limbo, as we are later told in the movie should be the case when that kind of drug is used. As another example, the lack of gravity is felt in the first level of dream, but not in the second level when the van is falling off.",0
"No-one, but no-one has achieved the feel of the dream state like David Lynch. On a fraction of the budget of this film,and zero CGI, he succeeds in being way more unsettling and detached from reality than any other director, and captures the vocabulary of dreaming authentically. Nolan is NOT a genius: The Dark Night was merely OK, and he dragged Gotham City into the gutter of a run - down Detroit, not the fantastical Gothic structures it should be. Memento was more interesting, though.When I saw the trailer I thought: ""Oh God, not Leo again. "" Or is it Neo? And the collapsing and spontaneously forming cityscapes are straight out of Dark City. Dark City was a Noir/Sci- Fi hybrid, too, made a long time before this. Doesn't have the awe-factor of,say 2001, or even Blade Runner.Not original, not brilliant, not lasting.It's true, what another reviewer said. This film is definitely age-indexed. The younger you are, the more impressed you'll be. The older you are, you might nod off, perchance to dream....",0
"What a disappointment! This movie is a technically good heist movie wrapped in a dream plot, that is boring like hell! The dreams look almost exactly like the reality and during the whole movie constantly somebody is shooting, running or escaping!Christoper Nolan outdoes himself in taking almost all the inspiring and challenging aspects away from an interesting idea! He strings together one exhausting action sequence after another without any creativity or a fresh, new approach regarding the exploration of dreams!The further you delve into the dream levels, the more you get bored by more spiritless action. At the end i thought: oh, perhaps i missed the point and this is the next James Bond movie and they deliberately left away the 007 in the the title to open up a further, contrived dimension. Very tricky!Inception looks like an intelligent, complex movie - that is what it wants to be - but it is only an action flick with almost none character development or intellectual aspiration.Christopher Nolan perhaps knows to impress technically but he fails completely to let me really care about his protagonists and the storyline. Technical perfection, the use of visual and special effects and an allegedly complex story can't substitute real vision, creativity and good character development! That's the difference between Inception and a masterpiece.",0
"Surely IMDb can survive without yet another amateur review for ""Inception"". I'm only doing this to justify myself about the 2 star rating. I would normally have rated this movie with 6 points. But as other reviewers state, I feel that is just fair to give a lower rate to balance a little the totally overblown rate it has. This film looks fantastic in Blu-Ray. There are several sequences that are a real visual delight (the Paris café scene where Di Caprio's character is explaining the young dream architect portrayed by Ellen Page and the 0 gravity sequence in the second layer dream). But the problem is that beyond that you don't have much. Looks like Mr. Nolan sacrificed plot line and character developed for the technical aspects. The plot is not complex, is just convoluted. The characters are cardboard thin and underdeveloped. I never imagined dreams could be as uninteresting as in this movie. Have you ever watched Fellini's movies? Or Tartovsky's? or Cocteau's? or Buñuel's? Plenty of dream-like images there ? One last word: it's a pity to gather such fine actors and waste them as Mr. Nolan did here; Joseph Gordon Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Watanabe san do what they can with the script, but Leonardo DiCaprio can't do much to give some life to his character. An utterly uninvolving movie. I'll stay with Matrix if I want a Hollywood production dealing with a superficial questioning of our perception of reality and sub consciousness.",0
"In my opinion the IMDb review by Carl_Tait from New York, NY is about the best summation of the film. A great concept but lost in translation. And to think Mr. Nolan wrote the story for ""Inception""!!! I include ""Inception"" among the film genre that have come to be known as ""mind**ck"" films. I don't agree with every list of films characterized thus on the web but this is an unmistakable genre. And ""Inception"" definitely belongs there.I suspect there are a lot of viewers out there who see a complex but convoluted film and find it gripping because BAM!! it hits them so hard on the head that they dare not concede they don't understand it because they are afraid someone will find out that they didn't :-) But there are a number of IMDb reviewers who have given ""Inception"" 10/10 or close to that rating. The way these reviewers have articulated their reasoning is definitely more comprehensible and cogent than the film is in my opinion. I wish Mr. Nolan had consulted them before making the film as I am sure they could bring some clarity to the mix.To my mind ""Inception"" has a convoluted and twisted narrative (if there is one) which *seems* multi-layered, but actually throws just about everything it can into the mix, never mind the sink, it throws in even the kitchen itself. I will say that the CGI effects are pretty amazing. But the film is overpopulated with characters and it was hard to figure out why more than half of them were there.And as another reviewer commented, what the heck are the guns and explosions doing in a film based on a shared dream paradigm.""Inception"" gave me no reason to care for any of the characters, excepting to some degree Ellen Page's character Ariadne. I had no reason to care for Marion Cotillard's character Mal, and found her portrayal somewhat of a female stereotype playing the neurotic unhinged foil.I am sure Mr. Nolan is an excellent film maker who has definitely come into his own as far as the box office is concerned. But so far the only films he has done that I have truly admired are ""Insomnia"" and ""Batman Begins"". Before ""Batman Begins"" I was never a fan of any of the Batman films.While watching ""Inception"" there was many a time that I felt like stopping and watching something else but gave it the benefit of doubt that the film might pick-up. Sorry to say it never did.I do hope Mr.Nolan gives a little more attention to maintaining a narrative and character development in his films rather than just bombarding us with complexity (or more accurately confusion!) and CGI effects.All I can say is that ""Inception"" is exhausting viewing and represents complexity for the sake of complexity or something like that.....",0
"I suppose you have to hand it to Chris Nolan. He made Warners so much money with his Batman revamp that was able to call the shots and sell not only them but a large segment of the (i suspect mostly male) movie going audience this risible turd of celluloid.Forget about the unoriginality (The Matrix, the architect), the protracted opening 45 minute snooze fest explanation and the sleepwalking acting (Dicaprio included). What really bugged me was that the whole corporate espionage yarn was a complete red herring. It was an excuse to tag on some action sequences that some impressive CG aside were really nothing to shout about. The alpine scene (sorry layer) was especially lame. I almost expected to see Burton and Eastwood appear on screen chased by Nazi mountain troops. Maybe someone could have dreamt them into the story at this point. Or even James Bond.Plot summary and spoiler alert below- You see Dicaprio had this problem with his wife committing suicide instigated by a previous inception so to rid him of her malign influence from his own dreams we are given this convoluted tedium in which another character who may be real or more likely may not be real eventually pops the wife in a dream so that Lenny can see his kids again, in a dream. Please.",0
"I wanted to like Inception because I think most of the people involved are talented, but it is just an endless exposition of the ever-changing 'rules' of the dreamworld. It's a shame. It isn't confusing, but it is very boring. There are no engaging characters and it has no trace of humour. It does have some good performances and... nope, that's it.It's not a terrible film, it's just very very dull. When all rules are taken away, it would be nice to see some genuine imagination - not a few FX set-pieces which don't, even at a most basic level, do anything to help the wafer-thin story, You know what this is like? It's like reading a dream diary - a fragmented collection of somebody else's ultimately vapid ideas. It's worth watching once to say ""Was that it?"" and shrug.Watch Mr Nobody instead. It takes Nolan to school.",0
"The idea is great but the final output is not.Too much James-Bond-a-like shooting and dummy car chasing scenes that won't do any good for taking the movie forward. You will just wait that the action(mindless shooting) stops and the movie will continue.Why they are dreaming skyscrapers, guns and soldiers instead of something more imaginative? The biggest problem is not that the story has some big holes. The movie is just boring most of the time. I hope we will not see Inception part II.Leonardo is not good choice for his role. Others do quite well.This movie will not give you any surprises.",0
"The movie is a cascade of factual errors and logical errors. The very foundation of the movie is so totally wrong and mistaken, that the movie makes no sense at all.Nolan should have done some research on ""Lucid Dreaming"" to get his facts straight. Reading only one book would have sufficed (Lucid Dreaming, by Steven Laberge).Were other movies brilliantly succeed (Dreamscape, Matrix, Existenz and possibly others), Inception miserably fails...For people who know very little about dreaming, this movie may seem great, but for those who do, this movie is a joke. Really too bad, I just can't understand how writers / directors can totally ruin potentially great ideas and concepts.",0
"Life is too short for this clichéd nonsense. The editing is truly dreadful and distracts from the experience. And it's a pretty meagre experience. There are more plot holes than in an actual dream. Very overacted too with cheap dialogue, ala: Cobb: I have it under control. Arthur: I'd hate to see it out of control. I mean c'mon, lines like that would be out of place in a TV movie, never mind a supposed work of art.Also, it might be a good idea to get an actor as your main man instead of Leonardo Di Caprio. I don't believe I've seen a single good movie he's been in. He managed to drag The Departed down, ruined (littered?) The Beach and starred in at least two awful movies: Titanic and Shutter Island. I've been spared most of his other shallow thespian endeavours.It's yet another turn of Hollywood's bloated corpse. Stick a fork in it, it's done.",0
"First of all, let me premise this review by saying that I'm not easy. Hollywood seldom makes movies that I think are worth watching and 2010 has been a particularly bad year. I don't watch children's or teen's films so those aren't considered in my comments.Inception is in no way Christopher Nolan's conception which is oddly the only thing that actually supports the entire theory of it. It's a planted thought. Le Guin dealt with the idea in Lathe of Heaven back in 1971. The concept of course would never fly since humans don't trust each other, let alone strangers, or to the extant necessary as outlined by Nolan. Taking it to more levels changes nothing but shows that the obvious is being ignored.The bad cinematography keeps the viewer from seeing scenes at the beginning of the film or was that just to save money? When a phone call ends and one party hangs up, you don't get a busy signal. Picking a team you trust means using a total stranger who is willing to go along with doing something illegal? Interesting definition of trust.The characters were not engaging. Not necessarily bad acting, you just didn't care about them. Leonardo's character was boring and predictable. The others were necessary for him to talk to/at and tell the rules to, only to break them.For all of the eye candy, the film lacked imagination or maybe it was budget constraints or maybe Nolan is just incapable of dreaming.I don't need a totem, just a refund.",0
"I am probably one of the few who did not like this movie. I like Chris Nolan as a director. I liked _Memento_, _Batman Begins_, and I loved his rendering of _The Dark Knight_. The problem I have with this movie is two-fold: First, dreams are not like the way they are depicted in this film. In dreams, you are not conversing with other individuals about highly technical subjects. In this movie's dream sequences, the characters are continuously explaining what's happening, and what's going to happen. And they are involved in the complex programming for the next level of the dream. In other words, the characters think, act, and behave as if they are not in a dream at all. It's a lot of exposition - really, a whole lot - and in my experience, dreams are just not like that. Yes things happen in dreams, and yes there are plenty of visual and auditory sensations - but I've never had a dream where someone gave me a 15 minute detailed technical explanation of what was going to happen next. I guess I wanted the dream sequences to be, well, more dream-like.Secondly, Leo's ill-fated romance just seemed to go nowhere. Every time that story thread comes up - the pace of the movie freezes. Leo has a way of delivering his lines very earnestly and urgently - and that's great and usually works well, as in _The Departed_. But if the script is weak - it just comes off as annoying and phony. I'm not sure what could replace the love interest thread - but it really hurt the movie in my opinion. I liken it to the relationship between Anakin and Padme in _Star Wars: Attack of the Clones_ - the second SW prequel - although that love interest was even harder to bear.I think the idea behind _Inception_ is great and original - but those two issues sank it for me.",0
"People have written much longer reviews so I am not going to go there. I saw it about 2 years ago and all I can say about it is arrrrrggggggghhhh! I almost hit my head on the coffee table from falling asleep twice. Can't remember much about it except that I found it hard to grasp and when I did...I did not care. I normally don't go to extremes when reviewing things, whether it is restaurants, hotels or movies. I always believe the truth is somewhere in the middle but this movie, and then the adulation heaped upon it made me mad!!!! Think Elaine from Seinfeld after watching the English Patient and you have how I feel. Thank you!!",0
"It's an original idea to introduce the alternate world of someone's mind as the place of the action, and by this i mean doing voluntary, deterministic, cause and effect actions that do affect the reality of the character involved. I'm not a great movie fan, i don't really make a goal for myself in following some trend or idea in the movie world, let's just say I feel sometimes the TV set has too much control on the movies I watch, :), and coming from this I dare to say that the theme is not quite present in the past years, and this is a good thing to start with for a success movie. But besides being an original idea, i think it's followers failed to make the most out of it. My point is that if you try to extract from the movie the specific of this new world they discovered for us you can see it's not too much. You can bend the cityscape, you can make the things explode, there are new specializations for the people involved (some create and some just act), and somehow you can keep some dead people consciousness trapped inside this world, and there's a door to some dark other world where these dead people go. And this is all about this mind world. The bad thing is that this is not enough. It's not enough developed for us and it was not enough for this movie authors. Apart from this comes a load of pop-corn movie elements which you can see in every typical action movie: they run a lot, they shot each other a lot, and that's about all. So the specific of the mind world is left apart, and the action movie takes too much. In this sense I say it's a lost opportunity. Too bad for them - the movie industry - that they spoiled us with such great movies as ""Solaris"", ""Dark City"", ""Sin City"", ""Immortel"" and a lot more - some of my favourite movies ever - and learned us what to expect from such alternate reality worlds and ideas. This movies have fully developed worlds in which the original element or idea is led to take entirely over the world and action and it's doing it so good ! The action of such movies can't be the same outside these movies and in this sense we can say these movies ideas are fully grown and developed. And this is the major shortcoming of ""Inception"", it can be more, it's a lost opportunity to do a really great movie with a novel idea.",0
"I don't like to write too much about it. Other people have already written enough, why it's really bad. I think Christopher Nolan have bought all this votes and higher rating. IMHO: Worst movie this year. 1)Mindless action film about the mind. 2)Rather primitive 3)Most Overrated Movie of All time!! 4)Best part of the movie was when it ended :) 5)Are you people watching the same film as me!!???? 6)Totally simple story for an idiot dressed up with special effects and nothing more etc. etc. etc. It is unbelievable that this film has received such accolades by reviewers. It is as if the film itself is trying to practise in real life its own concept: planting in the viewer's mind from the inception that it has extraordinary merit. This must be the ultimate film business gambit and possibly the most daring ever tried in film promotion history. Surrounded by mind-numbing images and eleven-dimensional sound you are told a hundred times every minute what a great film you are viewing. Just look at the audience when you go to see it (as I am sure you will): they looked bored and perplexed but have arranged their faces in expressions of seeming appreciation in fear of being thought of as square, to use and old beatnik term. This would be the dullest film I have ever seen!",0
"I saw it last week and really don't get the hype. OK, the idea is nice, but the movie itself is just like any other Mission Impossible of Oceans Eleven franchise. It is a boring heist movie. Apart from that the characters are lame. DiCaprio plays the same person as in Shutter Island and the action scenes are completely out dated. I thought I was Watching an Bond movie from the 80's from time to time. And why did they have to explain everything. I'm not stupid. Just a quick run through and we could have started. Nolan took over an hour to explain everything..... Why. No I also did not like Memento, so maybe Nolan's puzzles are not my cup of teaNo, this movie is not what I had hoped.",0
"This film is downright boring. I literally almost fell asleep at a noon showing. I also almost walked out 35 minutes before it ended; I simply did not care about any of these characters. The effects are neat, and look pretty great, but the story is so asinine that... wait, no, the story isn't asinine, its execution is.At its heart, this is the story of a man who regrets something that he said to his wife and through the miracle of modern technology, he believes he's able to unring a bell. That's it, really. Yet, rather than tell that story, a bunch of other nonsense is heaped in for ... I dunno why, to be honest with you.In addition, the film sets up its own rules and seems to break them at will. ""We can't do that or this will happen!"" seems to be the recurring predicament and yet, when at the crossroads, they just do ""this"" anyway and don't suffer the consequence, or they create some back door which, according to the logic presented earlier in the film, was impossible. As an example, there's a scene where the Page character, the Architect, is given her first ""go hence"" and she creates a compelling world that she managed to manipulate with ease. In fact, the Leo character comments--twice!--on how amazing she is at it. And yet, when they re- enter (or create another) dreamworld, they are all of a sudden ambushed on all sides. Their truck is pursued and shot up, etc etc. However, they've already shown that the Dreamworld does not have to obey the regular laws of physics, or anything really... why not just have things fall from the sky and crush the bad guys? When ""trapped"" on the middle of the bridge (someplace they need and want to be), why not just create physical barriers between themselves and the bad guys so the bullets can't hit them but they can still drive off?Perhaps the director's answer to that question is that these are TRAINED military attackers! Uh huh, which is why 8 million of them are unable to shoot up one van driven by a chemist. The same problem occurs earlier in the film, in the real world, when a bunch of agents are chasing Leo. Why give them guns? If it's a foot-chase, I'll buy what I was shown. By arming the pursuers, all I do is roll my eyes every 3 seconds at how preposterous the escape is. It's the equivalent of showing a bomb with 3 minutes left where the screen time is still a half hour. Guess what, Hollywood: your choices had the opposite effect you intended. Our anxiety isn't heightened, but our disbelief is.Further, when you're watching the action, you're aware that it takes place one, two and three levels deep. The further out you are from the farthest depth, the slower your action takes place. This is seen correctly when the van goes off the bridge... but if it were in fact the case, the van could not drive at regular speed prior to that... it would be slow all the time. That would be boring, you say. (I say it was boring anyway--Nolan proves once again that he's the worst action-sequence director going.) But boring isn't the issue. Time and Distance are. If it were slower, as it should be, they couldn't traverse the distance needed to the bridge.... which brings up the question that if you're the one creating the world, why not make your two destinations side by each? The hotel and the bridge do not need to be at opposite ends of the city, considering the bad guys are not going from the bridge to the hotel. There is constant reference prior to the world being created that it's a maze. No, actually, it isn't. There's nothing maze like about it. In another scene, two of the main protagonists, who we've been shown are EXPERT in the work they do, declare the mission a failure and complete. But the Page character, who joined the team a mere few days ago, stands up and explains to the experts how it's not over and can still go on. I groaned out loud at that one, not only because it's a ridiculous thing to expect your audience to swallow, but because it meant there was another 30 minutes left. Anyway, I'm rambling on. The acting was fine, the ideas in the story are interesting, but the film as a whole was very insignificant. There is so much needless exposition, it's laughable. (And there's a lack of exposition where needed.) In short, the film lacks grace. It really is unfortunate that Nolan's career, from an artistic level, is tanking so poorly. Worse is that his box office is not reflecting this, which will only encourage this behavior. The man's first 3 features were fantastic but since then he's just been getting worse and worse. Though I don't think this film is half as bad as Dark Knight, it isn't a tenth as creative or well done as The Following, Insomnia, or Memento, which it doesn't appear he will ever top.",0
"Pretentious, pointless, action-obsessed titillation. Pretentious because it pretends to present a new interpretation on a big, daring subject: dreams. But it doesn't. The execution is not even consistent with itself, doesn't make sense half the time and is entirely unenjoyable to watch because there is no character development and not story built. All you get are famous actors and expensive action scenes played on a background of unoriginal, repetitive music. This movie doesn't even measure up to the worst Hollywood crapola. Anyone who calls this movie a ""new religion"" is deluded by marketing and style devoid of any substance.",0
"I often compare movie ratings with religion. Just because most people say it's so, doesn't mean it is. This is particularly true for this pretentious piece of c$%p. To echo that of previous reviewers, weak plot, overly confusing attempt at creating another 'dream movie'. I attempted to watch this film 4 times, refusing to accept that I couldn't 'get it'. The fourth attempt lasted slightly longer as I wanted to give it more attention. However, boredom soon set in and I found myself reaching for the remote control once more.It really amazes me that people can enjoy watching such pap. If you want to watch a good dream movie then try 'Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind'",0
"...this is what 'Matrix' on steroids? I didn't finish watching this overrated pile of nonsense as the 'soap opera' subplot made what ever ending was planned impossible to care about.Never ending 'staccato' of guns shooting in: Tibet, Paris, Los Angeles (passing for NYC), in cars, out of cars, in buildings - on and on.Worse was the wife of DiCapprio - if one is going to write a story make it engaging.I have to say the more I 'see' 'heavies' assaulting the public through brawls, shootings, threats - the more it looks like a short career choice based on declining ability and brains. True actors actresses understand the ubiquitous chase scenes and shoot em' ups are filler because a script can't be coherently portrayed. I lost interest after one hour and pulled the disc before hour two was about to begin.",0
"I would like to say just something short, and I hope that some of the directors will notice that: Please, let the Matrix alone. You can't beat it with quasi ideas. This film for me is nothing but a stolen ideas. Even from Anachronox I found some stolen ideas. The plot is based on the stolen idea, even if it has some originality, all around the plot is empty because it is without some deeper thoughts.If the resources were spent on wrapping some more flesh around the details and story, all could have be different... Like this, too many questions: How they meet each other in the dreamworld? Where are the details and explanations? What HOLDING that world to don't fall apart????... There are more questionable reactions and scenes, but I don't want to go deeper because it is not worth.This film is insult for the Matrix fans.And by the way, only old people can lay down and sleep immediately.",0
"It beggars belief how both critics and movie-goers have been won over by this pseudo-intellectual piece of garbage. Really world? I thought better of you.There were three key problems for me in this movie. The first was the love story. Blah. I mean really, BLAH. This was an action based thriller, whose ultimate fate was rested on DiCaprio's characters obsession with his dead wife. Ultimately the film could have achieved its original thought provoking intentions had it dumped the obligatory Hollywood love story entirely.My second issue with this movie was the teams motivation for going into the energy tycoons son was weak. If you really want to get your audience thinking, why not try to get a politician to push through a new law, or stop the production of nuclear warheads? Why focus an entire movie, so well shot and expertly produced, in trying to get someone to break down a business? Finally, and maybe this was just me because I was disconnecting with the film at this point, but some of the dialogue was just way too cheesy and over the top. ""A dream within a dream within a dream? It's never been done before!"" All in all a big let down, mainly because the concept was great and some of the scenes were incredibly filmed, yet the producers bowed to the same old Hollywood model. Not all of us need to see a love story in order to engage our brains y'know.",0
"The plot was unnecessarily drawn out and complex. My theory is that everyone that sees it just says it is great because they want people to think that they are intelligent. You may be intelligent, but if you fall for it you are not. The director obviously figured out the human psyche, knowing that people would say they liked it just because it is complex and they want others to think they are smart. Well it is not complex, they just made it ridiculous. It did not need to be so complex to get the one point the whole 3 hours made. It was not suspenseful at all. It might deserve a 3 or 4 but I give it a 1 for wasting my time and to help drag down the undeserving 9/10 that it has. I just now saw it because I didn't fall for the previews, I just saw it was in the top 250 so I decided to give it a chance. This just reinforces how dumb people are. The 10/10 ratings must have come from children and cognitively deficient individuals. Don't waste your time, and please don't buy or rent it. Download it off the internet, all you need is BitTorrent (free program) and then search ""Inception Torrent"" on google, the first hit is usually the file you need. You can burn it to a DVD or watch it on your computer! Please god (imaginary, but a good phrase) don't pay to see it.",0
"Far too much for my brain to handle really as I found it really hard to follow, maybe would be more suited towards someone who can concentrate for more than 5 minutes",0
"In a lifetime of watching movies, the hardest I had getting through a whole movie was one called ""The Sicilian"" (1987). That was until I saw ""Inception."" The 148 minutes of sitting in my seat during its showing was worse than when I had a 16 hour flight to Australia with needles and pins running in my back and legs the whole way. Cillian Murphy is fabulous but our local high school could have supplied a better ensemble cast. The story was conceptually all right. But DiCaprio's headlining the movie helped to make it a disaster with his all of his excessive, over-dramatized, wide-eyed looks and theatrics. He's neither a sympathetic or interesting character. Put him in a suit, slick back his hair, and grow a little facial stubble, but he still looks like a teenager pretending to look like a grown up.",0
Jesus his movie is a TRAIN WRECK it has an amazing cast don't get me wrong but that's the only good part stay far away from this,0
"I respect the fact that I have a minority view of this film, the overwhelming majority of folks leaving such high praise in their comments. But boy, I found this so dull and I ended up really hating it. A pity, since I liked the concept and was looking forward to the film.The relentless force feeding of dramatic music and ugly-faced grimaces, attempting to give every scene in the film a weight it just didn't merit, was too much for me. Hardly a smile anywhere in this shockingly one-paced film and not a single character I could feel any warmth towards or empathy with. Complex without reason, lacking any hint of soul, riddled with cliched fight scenes, honestly - yuk! And for what - an ending that was predictable, cheesy and devoid of emotion.One star for being Chris Nolan, another for some interesting special effects. That's it.",0
"This is probably the most overrated movie of all time. Christopher Nolan doesn't seem to know how to explain something without expository dialog, and it gets really boring once you hear the same thing for a dozen times. This movie tries to be intelligent but doesn't want to lose the appeal to the masses, and tries to fix that by making sure that everyone understands exactly what is happening, and it made me feel as though I was in a kindergarten class. While it's a gorgeous film with incredible actors, the looks don't make up for the lack of script quality.",0
"No, seriously. It's not as good as people say. It did win four Oscars, but those were all in areas where the film truly does excel: visuals and sound.As for the plot, it's as full of holes as a Swiss cheese and about as smelly. A great cast can do little to make up for that.Don't believe me?http://bit.ly/1mk1xvyhttp://bit.ly/1p5u23wI really can't add much to that.The plot holes and the major inconsistencies, paired with the philosophical depth of a 14-year- old (is really ANYTHING real???) means there's little going for this film beyond the amazing visual effects and sound. Now, that would go a long way, if not for the fact that it's so ridiculously loooong! What we have here is a sensory tour de force dragged down by an atrociously poor story played out by amazing actors trying desperately to bring life to ridiculously shallow and one-dimensional characters.I've tried. I've seen it twice by now. That's five hours of my life I'm not getting back.",0
"I sat there in the dark when the last shot transitioned to blackout followed by the first credit appearing: ""DIRECTED BY CHRISTOPHER NOLAN."" And I didn't have the same or even remotely similar sinking feeling followed with audible laughter I did back when I saw ""Memento"" with its famous closing line. I know you cannot re-invent the wheel, but why-- why does everybody have a h#@$-on for everything this man does? ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Prestige."" Is anybody going to ever tell this man that he's not Stanley Kubrick? Or does he surround himself with yes-men the same way that George Lucas does? He hasn't graduated from the James Cameron School of Arrogance yet (hoping that he never attends). I didn't think that this was a bad film- it wasn't a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood drecks you see weekly, but it wasn't that good either. Even though Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" started to lose its way towards the end, it was more entertaining and THOUGHT-PROVOKING at times than this. I won't even get into the plot since so many other posters already have, and I know I'll be shot down for voicing any more criticisms over this ""masterpiece,"" but I hope-- I REALLY, REALLY hope that Christopher Nolan will make another ""Memento"" again. Maybe even a sequel, but no more ""Inception""s please.",0
"Of all the glowing reviews and heaped criticisms this movie has brought about, few ever mention the moral questioning that goes with the subject matter. Is it morally OK to 'invade' another persons sub-conscious and implant the idea of breaking up their inherited multi-national corporation, just so your own multi-national corporation can monopolise the gap left? No, clearly it isn't. The idea that this plot is somehow entertaining for the viewer and not deeply uncomfortable to watch is thoroughly disturbing.In a decade or so, when the gleam has been rubbed from this movie, I hope future generations can distinguish the difference between a fantastical set of dream sequences, _ la '8 1/2', and in the case of 'Inception', a truly frightening nightmare.",0
"Sorry about my English, is not really good.I've seen this movie yesterday, and after it I asked to myself ""What the hell was that?""First of all: I think the way that Nolan complicated the history is completely unnecessarily. Nolan gives you 100 dater per second, only to confuse you, so, you think ""Oh, it's complicated, it's a smart movie, it's great, I'm a smart guy"" Well, maybe you are not. The story could be easier and didn't lose the meaning (which is very stupid). Nolan make it difficult only for make it difficult. Second: What's the point of make 30 seconds' scenes? Make you feel sick and queasy. Can't Nolan make longer scenes? They talk ten seconds and Nolan shows you visual effects ten seconds, and then they talk about dreams another ten seconds, and then Nolan show you how a piece of cheesecake can become in a lemon pie, and over and over, and that's all. The history is silly, the plot is poor. The few jokes are bad. The characters are not interesting. The dialogs are really, really awful.Third: 3º best movie ever? What are you thinking about? Come on, must be a joke. Why is so cool? The idea is not original (seems to be a mix among Freddy Krugger, Matrix and an article about Freud take from Wikipedia), the visual effects are fine but have not sense at all (There are easier ways to say ""everything is on our mind""). I can't find what is so greatFourth: I think (maybe I'm wrong) many people like this movie cause it make them feel smart, and they believe that they've seen an intellectual movie. Well, I'm not an expert in philosophy or psychology (in fact, I know very little), and I know that the movie is fiction, but anyway, some concepts are completely wrong. I'm in the school yet (third world school), and we had psychology classes last year, and the teacher taught us that the subconscious is result of repressed impulses, so, you want your mother (in a sexual way) and the culture say you ""that's wrong and disgusting"" so you can't support it, and that's why you have dreams, because it's so hard to tolerate so you eliminate it from your conscience, but that is still in your mind, in your subconscious. So, what DiCaprio says about subconscious (Is result of our emotions) is wrong. He says the subconscious is something subjective (our ideas, our emotions), and is not. What make our subconscious is the culture what cause a guilty filling.And this year we've got philosophy and we've seen something about Idealism, and skepticism. It's not true that everything is idea. There is a reality, and our mind is made of this reality. This reality (the Society) makes our conscience, and the culture (which is real) make our subconscious. So, everything we think has a reality inception. We are made of reality. Would be great if in the middle of the movie Nicky Santoro (Casino) appeared and says to DiCaprio "" Maybe if I stick your head through that window over there you won't think that everything is an idea"" That's it. We need more Scorsese and less Nolan.Fifth: Does anybody find an interesting story? Because, I've seen a lot of guys saying thing about dreams and everything-is-an-idea (Yes Nolan, we get it. You don't have to repeat over and over). But the stories are pretty poor; Di Caprio's story and why the police is looking him, and his ex-wife, and his children didn't trap me at all. What's more, the story about the rich guy and his father is, for me, completely ridiculous. Nolan is very smart, he could think something smarter than that.So, What do we have? Visual effects and ideas that were taken for guys who died 300 years ago (like Descartes) or even before (like the skepticism Greeks). There is nothing new, or brilliant in ""Nolan's idea"". What we have is a lot of visual effects without meaning, and nothing else.Is this one of the best movies ever?",0
"I am rating this film 1/10 to try to lower the kind of insane 8.8 rating.I picked up this movie expecting something that would bend my mind. A good sci-fi story open to interpretation and contemplation on the fabric of dreams and reality and how you are to distinguish one from the other. A sense of wonder. I'm gonna keep this short and say that Inception did not give me that sense of wonder. Inception is an average Hollywood action sci-fi with nicely rendered CGI and famous actors who neither amaze nor disappoint. If this is what you are looking for in a movie, inception might be right up your alley. If not, I can suggest a couple of good films that are specifically about dreams. Go watch ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and the anime ""Paprika"".My definitive score for inception is a 5/10. It's just average in every aspect, and will probably not leave any sort of mark on film history for being either particularly good or bad, from an objective point of view. From a more personal point of view though, I thought this movie sucked big time.Have a nice day!",0
"Inception is a film that thinks it's too clever by half and then sets about insulting its audience by presuming they have no brain. No amount of pseudo-intelligence, rubbish dialogue and overuse of special effects can redeem this pile of junk. An inferior video game masquerading as high art.Christopher Nolan thinks he is a great director by basing his story on Freudian assumptions and psycho-babble but the dialogue is incomprehensible and the use of A-listers to carry the film shows that they are far more interested in making money than utilising their acting skills.",0
"Inception. Terrible movie. Huge waste of time. Dark scenes and mumbling actors made it hard to follow. Concept pretty far-fetched making it even harder to understand. At times I thought it would be better as a comedy, instead of the dark, twisted story it was. I've never done drugs, but this probably came close to an hallucinogenic experience. I'm still not sure what happened in the movie. How did I not fall asleep during this one?While most movie-goers don't really want to think about what's going on, that's all one could do during this stinker. Constantly thinking about what was happening; why it was happening; what did it mean; what did they say; who are all these people; what the heck is going on? About an hour into it I thought for sure I'd fall asleep, but Inception gave me such a huge headache, sleep was impossible.Inception may have been about dreams, but for me it was just a bad nightmare!",0
"Intriguing premise and interesting early scenes, but bored me to death during the second half of the movie, which in essence was just a ""C"" or ""D"" super-action movie which, ""aww shucks,"" just happens to take place inside someone's dream-world. Especially tiresome were the battles with endless ski-troopers inside the subject's ""militarized mind."" Utterly pointless. I was so bored that I didn't even care to think about the movie's completely predictable attempt at a thought provoking twist. I just didn't want to waste a single second more of my time in the ironically unimaginative mind of the movie's creator.Very boring and anticlimactic. Not even worth the time spend watching it IMO. The 5 stars are given largely for the initially interesting cinematography",0
"..is wrong with you people? It seems that most ""smart"" viewers were so busy trying to keep up with the stupid plot that they had no mental energy left for common sense, taste or critical thinking. The experience became unbearable as soon as the first action scene of the lets-plant-the-idea-mission began.As an odd coincidence my nose started running at the same time - heavily and nonstop. Having no handkerchiefs with me I had to wipe it barehanded until the end of the movie! This in a theater full of poor people like me also misled by the hype.It was probably my immune system trying its best to make me leave the seat.",0
"This movie spends far, far too much time telling instead of showing. The actors have to deal with so much exposition, the strain and boredom is practically palpable. Dialogue this obviously for the audience's benefit and this inorganic is completely undeliverable. It's not nearly so complicated that this level of explication is necessary, either.The biggest problem, however, is that this is not a sci-fi film or a thoughtful drama or the incredibly rare gem of a film that transcends any kind of genre that it wants to be. It's an action spectacle and that's all. It's not deep and the characters are issues with name-tags. The massive, driving climax full of supposed suspense left me unmoved and thinking about other things because I really didn't care about these thinly drawn stick figures. Additionally, the thinks-it's-very-clever ending was the cheapest trick in the book and it cheats at its own game.People comparing this to The Matrix (a film that really does rise above its genre and its spectacle, where even the minor characters feel fleshed out) aren't doing it any favours.",0
"Well ,after watching it in the theaters (I wasn't expecting much since the beginning of it) I've finally decided to write a review as honest as possible. It's simply another commercial trick that was made in purpose to get the money out of your wallets and it's just another one of those movies pretending to be some kind of an intelligent movie -and well...it's not exactly quality -more like garbage. The whole idea of 'breaking into people's dream and thoughts' is a total stealing from many TV shows and other movies ,comic books etc...you've all seen it before ,I mean -how many times have you seen this idea before?...dozens at least , not mentioning the stupid plot which is just ridiculous.The idea of making an idea more messy then it actually is is pretty dumb--it's not making any sense at all. It's way overrated and way too hyped and doesen't even deserve half the half of it's rating ,not mentioning how unconvincing the entire cast was -the whole thing is a big waste of time :it's boring ,endless and very uninspired ,total unoriginal garbage stealing other people's ideas and thoughts while numbing stupid people's brains even more... If you didn't understand the movie or just hated it ,I'll strongly recommend you to read Rex Reed's review on Observer.",0
"I must admit that the first time I saw Inception, I was surprised, it is after all a complex movie, however after repeated views I've realized that even though complex, it is not focused at all.By now, most of the people reading this review already saw the movie and as the high rating on IMDb reveals, most of the readers liked the movie. And in all honesty the first time or two times I saw it I liked it too, but as I said before repeated views, reveal the incoherent, pretentious, even ridiculous defects of the movie.The main one (and my biggest complaint) being the ''main plot'' of the movie, completely amoral, simple and without depth nor real development. There is no reason at all for the viewer to root for the main cast, when they are ruining one guy's life just or the sake of helping other to make more money. The ''heroes'' are anti-heroes or just true villains, they are thieves, criminals and the only redeeming quality, that is Cob's (DiCaprio's character) wish to see his children again, is in the end just a dream, an illusion. I don't think that every movie should have a heavy load of morals, however including true redeeming qualities adds depth and layers to the script and the characters, here we have 1 dimensional characters that spit lines of dialog without truly adding something to the plot, just for the sake of making the ''Heist Movie'' more interesting. And one last thing, shame on you mister Nolan for bringing such great actors like Tom Berenger and especially Michael Caine to recite 3 lines in the entire movie, shame on you.1/10 And that's because I cannot put a 0 on it. Yes the technical aspects of the movie are superb, however not even that saves this movie, unlike Avatar, that the visuals, do carry the whole movie.",0
"First, let me say that ALL the Actors, but one, were fantastic, and the one that wasn't, had a language/enunciation problem. (half the time he spoke you couldn't understand what he said) But good actors (and believe me they did their damnedest!)can't make up for a wandering script with poor suspension of disbelief. Just when something needed expounding or explanation, the script would jump to a different scenario. And the sound! I guess the editor thinks that when you push the volume, no-one will notice how the villains (the ""projections"") have no identity (individually OR in groups) for the audience to hate (OR love.) So loud during the bombings and shoot-'em-ups, I had to plug in my ear- buds. This movie could have been the best of the year with INTELLIGENT rewriting, editing, and minus the actor with questionable language skills. Instead, it was nonsense. I can not believe IMDb's 9.2/10 rating. I smell a rat. I guess if Congressmen and Senators take bribes, why not IMDb ""payola""!",0
"Okay, so when I dream, anything can happen. I have had dreams within dreams, and there was no special time ratio. Everything is so contrived, when, as others have mentioned, the director could have done just about anything he wanted since it is a dream. I'm not sure how people can dream together and have any kind of dream harmony, or effect any outcome on others. None of it makes any sense, and it's just a skeleton on which to hang crappy computer generated images; those beach scenes are especially cartoon-ish and pathetic. I love Leo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and that the two of them together couldn't redeem this pseudo intellectual turd of a movie just shows how bad it really is.",0
"""The Emperor's New Clothes"" is a short tale by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an Emperor a new suit of clothes that are invisible to those unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent. When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, a child cries out, ""But he isn't wearing anything at all!"" Personally, I find this movie an utter waste of time and recourses.Am I the child in the above-mentioned tale? Am I not intellectual enough to understand this marvelous gem: Inception? Or perhaps the majority of the users on this forum are scared of submitting negative reviews, for they might be regarded by others as stupid for not being able to comprehend the intellectualism in this movie.PS: I watched this movie in two parts (for it is long and boring) and I managed to fell asleep on both occasions.",0
"It may be just my preference, but I don't care for films that seem to start in the third act and never seem to leave it.I usually like the films of DiCaprio. I think he's a convincing actor. And I do appreciate the production values. But I found the constant, ominous background music cloying at times. This film is hard to get into at first, and unfortunately doesn't get any easier as time goes on. Unlike most films that seem to start at the end, then the remaining film is spent retroactively, filling in how everyone got there, this film just continues to twist the viewer around without mercy. Sorry, but I like to relax when I watch a movie.I realize, the dream scape can be ambiguous, but I would have rather spent this 2.5 hours weaving my own, eyes closed, in bed. Z Z Z Z",0
"I was profoundly disappointed because a so-called masterpiece like the movie Inception would be an overrated action flick of mediocrity. Inception is far from a masterpiece: it is not intelligent nor mind-blowing. With a shallow story, plot holes all over the place, uninteresting characters and bad cinematography, the movie proves one thing: that a basic, undeveloped, but polished idea, is enough to get loved by people and capitalize hundreds of millions with the help of expensive CGIs and tons of dumbfounded action.First off: the concept. The movie was simply able to get away with various inconsistencies and poor world building because of its shallow idea developments and lack of specificity. While the idea of ""a dream within a dream"" is a cool concept, the movie never spends time setting up all the fundamentals and world building. How does it work? Do you just plug yourself in and create everything? What can you control in a dream? How far is the scope of imagination? If you can just imagine a bazooka to kill your enemies, can't you just heal yourself? If you go deeper to three or four dream levels, how do you perceive time and think thousands of times as normal without overworking or blowing your brains out? All these work on kids' logic, that you can imagine anything, and things would just miraculously operate in an inexplicable way you want. OH LOOK! TURN AWAY! Here's a one-hour action sequence with a van slow-motionally falling into water, a guy walking around the hallways with zero gravity and explosions and killing and massive CGIs! Ha! Bet you didn't notice all those inconsistencies did ya?Now, to the ending, let's not kid ourselves, that wasn't twisty and mind-blowing at all. Okay, he was still living in a dream at the end, so what? If Mal kills herself and wakes up, wouldn't she wake him up too? Why is he still here? Why do they show him fly to America, hack into that guys' mind, they wake up many times still being in a dream? The twist doesn't mean anything and offers no one closure or meaning to the story. Oops no time to explain that since we already skipped all the world building at the beginning. When everyone wakes up at the end, the dream machine with all the strings has already disappeared so they have no risk of getting caught by the rich guy.Whether most of the actors were miscast, have bad acting, or bad writing, the characters have no personality nor attraction for me at all. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings out no other dynamics than his straight serious cop face like in 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Ellen Page's character is unconvincing, who looks confused and worried for the whole movie. Her voice is flat out without emotions and her mouth constantly moves unproportionately to her face as if she's reading from a textbook. Everyone in the movie delivers lines like robots talking about math. However, this is not to include that most of these lines are redundant, and repeating to the audience with information that were already given in the previous scenes.The film holds no impact, no momentum. Supposedly emotional and introduction scenes were rushed through and action sequences were stretched out obnoxiously long. Even the scenes with Cobb and Mal were boring and unimpactful. No stakes were set: Cobb's reason to get back to his kids (which is really not that important since we don't know how close he is to them) seems to be stressed more than everyone falling in a permanent brain-dead state. Nolan tried to cram all the unimportant technical information and characters into the film and forgot to tell a good and fulfilling story.With that being said, I refuse to recognize this movie as anything near to good or masterpiece.",0
"The problem with Inception is that its execution doesn't fit its subject matter. This is supposed to be a movie about dreams...so where is the dream-like quality? It's not abstract, it's very cold and calculated - it's all to linear - a perfectly plotted beginning-middle-end story; ffs, even the dreams have rules! Since when do dreams have rules? Or even a through-line? It's not a murky shade, it's just cold mechanical computer-generated imagery like all Hollywood productions. This might be how robots dream in binary, but not the ungraspable mystique of how organisms dream, something that the likes of Tarkovsky, Bergman or early practical films conjured up both movingly and authentically, and at times down-right creepily. Nolan's clockwork extravaganza is as devoid of personality as the man himself. To look into one's dreams would be intimate - Nolan eschews intimacy for spectacle generated by 1's and 0's.",0
This is a bad film. It is really sad to see so many people work so hard to produce this thing. So fake so pretentious so arrogant so little. Well it is supposed to be an action movie and people love it because they just want to have fun for their buck. Don't get me wrong - I like action in movies but this is so superfluous and boring...,0
"Inception is the kind of stupid plot an overexcited child might have come up with. Nolan seems to have become so caught up with his own brilliance of questioning reality and dreams he's forgotten to come up with anything resembling a plausible plot. Inception is drivel. It pretends it has hidden depths and meaning by using the most convoluted plot I've seen in a film for years. It's banal, intellectually dull, and unimaginative, with not one character worth caring about. Half way through writing the plot Nolan mus have suddenly realised that if it's a dream then no-one is actually in any real danger _ hence he comes up with limbo! It's like you can see him scratching his head as he realises no threat = no tension. Thus we have LIMBO!At least when Christopher Smith made the much better film - Triangle - he realised (and openly admitted) that these kind of plots are likely to get out of control BUT he also realised you can still allow people to enjoy the ride if you care about the characters and there is tension and something at stake. But with Inception there is no tension, excitement, there is no-one to care about. For Nolan's sake I hope one of his films bombs soon because that's the only thing that's going to wake him up. He used to make interesting films.",0
"This movie was just really, really boring. Nothing particularly bad about it; just nothing very good. Just like True Grit and Forrest Gump, by about halfway through the movie, I gave up caring what happened next. The characters were largely unrelatable and for the most part unbelievable. The effects were good on the big screen, but they definitely won't carry the film when set on a smaller screen in someone's living room. And Nolan was right to worry that the combination of Marion Cotillard and ""I Regret Nothing"" would be a big distraction. The movie was easily thirty minutes longer than it needed to be, yet in the overallocation of time Nolan still could not set up enough of a real connection between the characters to explain why they would all be so loyal and invested in one another (particularly Ariadne; why does she care? She just met these guys). Just more evidence that Oscar picks are really just vanity pieces, and the Best Movie list is your go-to for time-wasters to avoid.",0
"I still don't think this guy has melded his talent into a great movie...although I'm sure most will disagree. The closest he came in my opinion was ""The Prestige"". If he ever gets the emotional part of the movie to be the driving force....& gets his very bright ideas to seam together just right.....I think he could make a movie thats as unbelievably good as most folks think this one is.Lets see....who is the dreamer in this scene cut..are we at level 1,2, or limbo, or somewhere else? Which players are on sedatives & what kind of Kicks do they need to go to the level somebody thinks they should be at & should they be synchronized kicks with music and/or free falling, and/or feeling gravity, etc. ad infinitum. Cut to the mountain fortress snowmobile scene....I thought for sure a scene from a James Bond movie got cut in by mistake here...all the bad guys wearing the same uniforms & chasing the good guy(s)& setting the explosives & shooting bullets galore....I guess this was an action movie as well with the car chases and crashes & well, you know.This movie could very easily be summed up as a dream somebody had....somebody that you never see in the movie...just somebody's dream. And some people think it was that.You have to give Nolan credit for a lot of his ideas, really good production values, and other movie making strengths. I thought it went way overboard with the complexity of who is the dreamer & who is sharing dreams with who & what level are they on & what are all the rules on that level, did they get into limbo & what is limbo exactly & do you really feel pain if you get shot in the leg...but if you get shot in the head you just wake up...or maybe go to double limbo if the architects totem is spinning, but maybe it's the dreamers totem, but if it's Cobbs totem & he got it from Mal it really doesn't work for him anyway. You could go on & on about this...but I guess you get my drift.I think Nolan has has the talent to make a great movie...but I think it will have to get people in their emotional core & I don't think he has done that yet. I liked ""The Dark Knight"" when ""The Joker"" character was in the scenes...too bad about Ledger...he was really showing some acting chops big time.I probably would have thought this movie was a lot better when I was much younger.",0
"Big hype movie with big money stars - OK, you already have your audience coming in the doors of the theaters and will probably make budget the first weekend. So how do you get them to keep coming back, rent this and buy it even? How about you make it soooo complicated that a post graduate English major cannot even decipher the scrambled plot line on first review? Yep!This film is FILLED with awesome special effects, yes most certainly. However, are there not some people who actually care about following a plot? I asked three people under 25 who saw this movie if they liked it and they all said ""yes!!"" However, when I asked them to explain it to me they ALL said that they really didn't understand it but it looked sooo cool. Well, is that what a movie is now? ""I don't understand what it was about but it was really cool how those buildings bent and ..."" Go see the Grand Canyon. Visit Old Faithful. Get off the couch if you want to ""see"" something spectacular. I get it - yeah, cool special effects. But someone explain to me how you do not wake up in a dream within a dream if you get startled in your first dream. While I may be one of the very few, I expect my movie to make some sort of logical, even if very extremely far fetched, sense. Inception? Not exceptional-",0
"First I would like to say that I would strongly recommend you read some of the reviews *before* you watch the movie. Several one-star reviews are very well written and help set expectations. Having done that, and sort of knowing what to expect, I found I was less confused when I finally saw (rented) the movie. That said, it clearly did not live up to its potential. The special effects and overall visuals are incredible. There's no denying that. The ""why"" behind some of the visuals and effects can be confusing however. If it's taking place inside a dream, where literally anything is possible, why the complicated trek across a frozen landscape, several dream-layers deep, to some strange vault, for example? Or why wasn't the van bulletproof, or equipped with some neat Bond-type gadgets? Why use a van at all ... it's a dream, why not use an armored military vehicle? Real dreams virtually never consist of contiguous or linear events either. Going from Point A to Point C never implies first having to stop at Point B, although in this movie we are led to believe that is a requirement. Other 'laws' are less stringent but inconsistent - you could awaken from the dream state if you die, or you could end up in 'limbo', depending on where you are in the storyline. There are aspects of the plot that should have been better explained, or developed, such as the concept of 'limbo' itself, or Ariadne's background and why she was so 'special'. Overall it was a disappointment, and although clearly over-hyped, it is not the worse movie ever. It's not one you would want to watch a 2nd time, unless of course it's being reviewed by Tom Servo & Crow on the set of MST3K ! :-)",0
"This movie started off terrible, and then just got worse and worse.From the premise of the movie, the ending, it was cliche and tiresome to the point of annoyance. I nearly walked out of this film. With the 2 other people I watched this movie with, I asked them both to name one other characters name in this movie 5 minutes after we walked out of it. Neither could name a character besides the lead, who was only memorable as he was a complete an utter liability (DiCaprio's character Cobb). Each character is introduced into this movie like a comedy, with no backstory, or substance to them, and with there name barely mentioned. The lead characters father introduces one of the character, which just happens to be a fresh face university student, who just happens to be down for some CRIME.The chemist, who has a maybe a hundred different bottles of potions behind him, ALL UNLABELLED, who just picks one out and says ""this is the one you need, oh yeah, I'm down for some CRIME, I'll join you.""All the other characters are incredibly forgettable as you go further into this movie and the plot unravells, where you begin to think to yourself ""is this the best way to do this? Or just the most complicated and ridiculous way?"" Southparks parody of this film sums up this movie perfectly.The dramatic scenes of tension are EXHAUSTING where you actually get bored of them, and the pace of the scene is just frozen in a seizure. It's not comfortable at all that was where I just wanted to walk out. The lead character is also a cliched abomination that lets this entire movie down with his backstory, that lingers like a leaking sewer in the air. It slows down the entire movie again, and caps it all off too. People rating this movie so highly really haven't looked at this movie objectively at the substance of the movie or its characters, or the MANY, MAAAANY holes in the story, or just how cliche the entire premise and story is. The worst movie I'll never forget.",0
"This show is excellent. No doubt about it. But so much of this show is an absolute rip off from the anime movie Paprika by Satoshi Kon. As much as I would like this show if it wasn't for not having seen Paprika first, the only problem is, I have.It ain't exactly the same. But I felt its close enough. Implanting a memory through a dream, that's the exact same premise of both stories.For anyone who has seen Paprika, you may find an awful lot of similarities here and it is truly showing that America needs to find something better to do than copy other people's works.Nevertheless, besides my cynical behaviour, I applaud this series for what it has managed to achieve to do, as it has one of the greatest fan bases a modern movie can ask for and I still don't feel that it is overrated. I just feel that it was far too similar to Paprika.",0
"This is a concept film, with a great deal of cgi. I love concept films, and feel cgi can make a movie much more powerful. However, this was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.First, there is zero character development. The lead role is a waste of DiCaprio's sizable talent.Second, the concept is not actually that interesting. There are many, many movies with much lower budgets that actually present the concept in a much more powerful and important way - such as _Scanners_.Third, the cgi is pathetically overdone. The cinematographers seem to expect the viewer to be overwhelmed by sheer scale, rather than use cgi to enhance a well-shot, well-scripted, well-conceived film. For an example of cgi used well, see _Pan's Labyrinth_ or _Attack the Block._ Most people will respond to sheer scale, but for viewers who love great films, this movie is bound to disappoint.I walked out of the movie and thought, ""so what?"" Then I thought, ""I just wasted $8.50, that's what.""",0
"This film has everything that you would want for in a film this complex and mind bending... everything except an ending that makes sense of it all! After spending over 2 hours falling through levels, and bending my mind around levels within levels withing levels, and still not knowing what the hell any of this is about, i simply concluded that the film was one big piece of slightly boring eye candy that made, and was supposed to make, absolutely no sense what so ever! And as a giant piece of eye fluff it does pretty well... but it could have been so much more! You might ask what more? but to be honest i can really say... and really it doesn't matter any way - because it's not my film! I am so tired of telling other people how to fix their films... after they are already in the can! Figure it out yourself!",0
I had this film sitting around on my hard drive for a good 6 months and never got round to watching it. But after seeing the high score this film has on IMDb I thought it was about time I took a look at this 'masterpiece'. I started watching the film back in January and managed to handle around 30 minutes before my interest started to wain. After another few weeks I finally had a second attempt at watching the whole film and I have to say I think I need a commendation for sitting through this convoluted mess all the way to the end. How this film has ended up at No.8 in the all time Top 250 I have absolutely no idea; all I can think of is nowadays very good special effects constitute this film as a classic as opposed to acting and storyline??? Perhaps they're are too many sheep on the planet nowadays....this would account for the ridiculous 8th best film of all time ranking.,0
"yes, it's brilliant! the cinematic effect was outstanding! but what is the real essence of the story? what is the core idea? simple: stealing ideas or implanting one through the dream state. that's it.i felt so dumb while i'm watching this movie. there are so many questions left in my mind after. a good movie does not do that to audiences. it can be complex, it can be convoluted, but in the end the viewers should have a grip on it. at first, i was astounded by the very idea of the story but as i reflected on it i realized that the only thing the film successfully did is obscure the brilliance of the core idea. a good movie communicates with its audience. inception only blurred the communication lines.",0
"I thought this movie was going to very good and had to wait a few days for it to show up available at the Red Box kiosk. I rented a second movie as well and put that one on first in anticipation that Inception would be my ""special"" movie of the evening.Well, it was not special at all. I quit about halfway through. I kept thinking to myself that everything you saw must be a dream and maybe it was but I could not sit through the whole thing. All of the criticisms have been levelled at this movie already and I won't repeat them and just add that I endorse those that happened before half of the movie was done. I did enjoy Momento but not this load of tripe.",0
"Well, after writing my summary maybe I don't need to write a review.First off, this isn't really my type of film. But I watched it and tried to follow it as closely as possible.But the film is way too long, overdone, too complicated and too messy. It is also too literal. Dreams are messy, choppy, chaotic and blurry. For some reason, dreams for this crew are pretty neat and orderly. Sure things seem distorted at times but not in a dream-like manor.And then the films starts to fall into the Hollywood formula with chases, people shooting, people getting shot, blah, blah, blah.I frankly became bored with the entire thing and was glad when it was over. I don't understand all the fuss over this.",0
"The levels of boredom I reached during this film will take a fair while for me to forgive Christopher Nolan, the Director, for. A very simple idea has been taken and, just like my headphones do in my pocket, twisted and turned to leave me wondering how on earth they managed to get in this nonsensical situation. It's one saving grace, the CGI, has been used to try to endlessly distract the audience from the utter tripe being pass off as a story-line. I'm surprised that the distributors weren't legally obliged to provide the audience with an eye wash with their ticket, as the intense editing and camera movement left me, on several occasions, having to check my eyes weren't bleeding.Like The Matrix, it beggars belief that this film is being held up as some sort of future classic. Either I'm a genius, hovering in a state of advanced consciousness, or the people who loved this film are stoners or morons, unfortunately, for my ego, I suspect the later to be the reality.Save your money.",0
"I sat there in the dark when the last shot transitioned to blackout followed by the first credit appearing: ""DIRECTED BY CHRISTOPHER NOLAN."" And I didn't have the same or even remotely similar sinking feeling followed with audible laughter I did back when I saw ""Memento"" with its famous closing line. I know you cannot re-invent the wheel, but why-- why does everybody have a h#@$-on for everything this man does? ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Prestige."" Is anybody going to ever tell this man that he's not Stanley Kubrick? Or does he surround himself with yes-men the same way that George Lucas does? He hasn't graduated from the James Cameron School of Arrogance yet (hoping that he never attends). I didn't think that this was a bad film- it wasn't a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood drecks you see week, but it wasn't that good either. Even though Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" started to lose its way towards the end, it was more entertaining and ""thought-provoking"" at times than this. I won't even get into the plot since so many other posters already have, and I know I'll be shot down for voicing any more criticism over this ""masterpiece,"" but I hope-- I REALLY, REALLY hope that Christopher Nolan will make another ""Memento"" again. Maybe even a sequel, but no more ""Inception""s please.",0
"I like good sci fi movies. This is not a good one. The plot was predictable. There was nothing unexpected. There is constant violence at every dream level. Why does every dream have to be about running from an army of thoughtless killers or assaulting a heavily defended alpine military outpost for no apparent reason? The 'architect' has little direct and obvious impact. She really was just a counselor for the star, or just wanted to throw in a 'pretty face' for the obvious and demeaning task of window dressing. They should have had her kick some butt if they were going to have a 2 hour gun battle. The special effects were far from spectacular. The star cast is great and they did what they could with what little they were given. They could not overcome the weaknesses.",0
"Writer-director Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time, money and I.Q. points. ""Elegant"" because his work always has a crisp use of color, shading and shadows, and ""hack"" because he always takes an expensive germ of an idea, reduces it to a series of cheap gimmicks and shreds it through a Cuisinart until it looks and sounds like every other incoherent empty B-movie made by people who haven't got a clue about plot, character development or narrative trajectory. Like other Christopher Nolan head scratchers-the brainless Memento, the perilously inert Insomnia, the contrived illusionist thriller The Prestige, the idiotic Batman Begins and the mechanical, maniacally baffling and laughably overrated The Dark Knight-this latest deadly exercise in smart-aleck filmmaking without purpose from Mr. Nolan's scrambled eggs for brains makes no sense whatsoever. Is it clear that I have consistently hated his movies without exception, and I have yet to see one of them that makes one lick of sense. It's difficult to believe he didn't also write, direct and produce the unthinkable Synecdoche, New York. But as usual, like bottom feeder Charlie Kaufman, Mr. Nolan's reputation as an arrogant maverick draws a first-rate cast of players, none of whom have an inkling of what they're doing or what this movie is about in the first place, and all of whom have been seen to better advantage elsewhere. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who remains one of the screen's most gullible talents. After his recent debacle in Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese's dopey insane-asylum bomb, one hoped for something more substantial from the easily misled Leo, not another deranged turkey like Inception. He should have stayed in bed.I'd like to tell you just how bad Inception really is, but since it is barely even remotely lucid, no sane description is possible. Let's see. It opens with crashing waves on a beach. In the middle of a July heat wave, I wanted to jump in, but the thrill didn't last. Cut to the battered face of Leo, looking like a 14-year-old washed ashore facedown from a toy sailboat. He has come from another location conjured up in a dream, and is fond of muttering jabberwocky like ""I am the most skilled extractor of dreams."" In other words, he can close his eyes, enter somebody else's dreams with his pock-marked baby face and blow up China. The excellent Marion Cotillard, who has spiraled a long way down from her Oscar-winning role as Edith Piaf, growing a wart in the center of her forehead in the bargain, is the ghost of his ex-wife. Leo lives in a state of guilt for her death. He is also a thief, plowing his way through dark kitchens waving guns with silencers to relieve locked safes of their contents. Living in a continual dream state, he wants only to get home to his father (Michael Caine in a walk-on of fewer than a dozen lines) and two kids, but first he must, according to the production notes, ""extract valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable."" To this end, Mr. Nolan works in something about the world of corporate espionage that turns Leo into an international fugitive. Now, Leo and his team of special ""extractors"" must achieve ""inception""-meaning that instead of stealing dreams, they must plant some. If you're still awake, you're one step ahead of me. I dozed off ages ago.Through the use of computer-generated effects, buildings fold like cardboard containers, cars drive upside down and the only way you can wake up within the dream is death. None of this prattling drivel adds up to one iota of cogent or convincing logic. You never know who anyone is, what their goals are, who they work for or what they're doing. Since there's nothing to act, the cast doesn't even bother. It's the easiest kind of movie to make, because all you have to do is strike poses and change expressions. It all culminates on skis in the middle of a blizzard, as Leo is pursued by machine-gun-equipped snowmobiles, but you don't even know who's driving them. I have no idea what the market is for this jabbering twaddle-probably people who fritter away their time playing video games, which I'm willing to bet pretty much describes Christopher Nolan. He labors over turning out arty horror films and sci-fi action thrillers with pretensions to alternate reality, but he's clueless about how to deal with reality, honest emotions or relevant issues.Inception is the kind of pretentious perplexity in which one or two reels could be mischievously transposed, or even projected backward, and nobody would know the difference. It's pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular, but I keep wondering: Can he do anything of more lasting value? He's got vision, but creating jigsaw puzzles nobody can figure out and using actors as puppets who say idiotic things, dwarfed by sets like sliding Tinker Toys, doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me.",0
"At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In the case of Inception, almost immediately: in a bid to make the ultimate 'mind-f**k' movie, writer/director Christopher Nolan starts his film at 'bloody confusing' and, over the course of 148 excruciatingly drawn-out minutes, works his way up to 'completely and utterly unfathomable' before leaving the film on a predictably ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).Along the way, Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea, but the ones that haven't been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, Dark City, Cypher) are so half-baked that the film inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb's FAQs), none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best efforts of Nolan's rabid fan-boys).Lost in Inception's labyrinthine plot, all I could do was sit back and marvel at the special effects_which are undeniably impressive_whilst asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great architect despite no actual work experience, and whether such a pretty young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow, I doubt it.5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular, the awesome gravity-defying fight scene), and I reckon that's being generous.",0
"A terrible movie starring a bad actor, Lenny DiCaprio, that goes on far too long and gives the first justification for divorce I have ever heard on screen:---- I miss you more than I can bear... ---- but we had our time together. ---- And I have to let you go. ---- I have to let you go.The heroes taunt each other with an uplifting tagline:---- I'm an old man. ---- Filled with regret. ---- Waiting to die alone.So what did you expect from a divorce?But not to worry, our character is young and returns home to his children. His dying alone will have to be postponed until they graduate from high school.",0
"One has to look no further than at this two and one half hour bag of hot air to understand why American film is on life support. In what would have made for an absorbing thirty minute Twilight Zone episode in the mid sixties has been (through the wonder of technology) turned into a flashy and noisy blockbuster as director Chris Nolan applies lipstick to this pig by the bucket. Cobb (Leonard DiCaprio) is a dream stealer in a land and time not far from now. He's particularly valuable to corporations keen on getting an edge on competitors but now in order to go legit and see his kiddies again he must do the reverse. Impossible you say, not in Chris Nolan's fantasy land of computer generated gimmickry and circuitous dialog.Inception's slick dishonesty lies in the parallel universe of the real and unreal worlds Nolan creates in an attempt to humanize its disheveled super hero by giving it a patina of reality and generate sympathy for Cobb. But Cobb along with everyone else acts like a stilted automaton (or Joe Friday from Dragnet) and while it try's redistributing its weight to give balance to the money shots (you know the fireworks) it comes across mawkish and syrupy. The premise itself is hashed and rehashed ad nauseum and so much one gets the idea that the producers are not only attempting to blind with shock and awe but confuse you with non-sequitors in hopes of successfully cloning you to buy another ticket.Even in the real world it is based Inception remains a fairy tale working off the borderless freedom of fantasy where things don't have to be logical just convenient. Nolan was far more successful in bringing the fantasy reality factor closer together in Insomnia and Memento. There was a grittier tension in these low budgets that Nolan has lost since hitting the big time and having at his disposal a huge budget for all star casts ( mostly wasted in minor roles here) and exotic locales to play out his ideas. These productions (Batmans plus The Prestige) may spare no expense but they lack soul and usually flounder mid way.While the blame can be clearly affixed to the the shoulders of writer, producer, director Nolan I would be remiss not to acknowledge cinematographer Wally Pfister's murky and dull compositions and Hans Zimmers relentless music score which plays like a leaky faucet throughout the entire film. Like an IV it attempts to transfuse suspense into the plot with an annoying undercurrent and the occasional crash of brass.",0
"I loved some of Nolan's other films. I really loved Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige. I liked The Dark Knight.During Inception I kept checking my watch. I was trying to decide whether I checked my watch (as in, ""are we there yet?"") more times during a recent, torturous, 9-hour transatlantic flight or during this 2 hour 20 minute movie.I think as a 90 minute movie this would have been fun and entertaining. Nothing too special but it would have been a fine entertaining movie. I don't get what all the fuss is about.It's like a high-priced CGI-laden attempt at a Philip K Dick novel but a little overwrought.",0
"How this is number 13 in the list is beyond me. It wasn't that I didn't get it, it was more that I did get it, but didn't get what the big deal was about. Going inside people's dreams - big wow.The special effects were pretty clever, but that is no substitute for quality plots or acting.That this has been voted an average 8.8 by your common sci-fi nerd unfortunately undermines the best film site on the net, which is a shame because the 'top 250' is usually a good democratic film review. That is except when it is hijacked by what is tantamount to troll pressure group.",0
"I've seen many of director Christopher Nolan's films by now. Here are my thoughts on each of them:Following (1998)The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.Memento (2000)The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.Insomnia (2002)The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.Batman Begins (2005)After feeling kinda cheated by previous Nolan efforts, I did not bother with this one. (What truly serious director does Batman, anyway?)The Prestige (2006)The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.The Dark Knight (2008)Watched this one because of all the high ratings on the internet sites. The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated. (What truly serious director does Batman, anyway?)Inception (2010)Nolan's best effort yet, and while the craft is really superb and the thematic elements are certainly intriguing, on the whole it comes off as *extremely*, pointlessly gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.Overall assessment:M. Night Shyamalan with more elaborate gimmicks. Emperor Nolan isn't wearing any clothes, you philistines!",0
"I haven't got the faintest idea of what this is about. Perhaps something about controlling other people's dreams, to get what you want. In this case it's once again the evil corporation, which wants to rule the world. OK, great.In fact there is no plot or five running at the same time. You decide. You can see Paris upside down if you're interested, but really, the time when we got impressed by computer tricks is since long over.Together with all the quasi-intellectualism in the dialog, this is very hard to stand and not even entertaining. Something is wrong when you're bored already after two minutes and then, there are more than 140 minutes to go. A serious warning about this.",0
"I was trying my best to keep from falling asleep. What purports to be a breakthrough film about dreams, turned out to be a first-rate, high-budget snooze fest. The writer couldn't decide, I suppose, whether he wanted to do a James Bond movie or the Matrix or the Thirteen Floor. Leo Dicapprio's character is insipid. Ellen Page's character is two sentences short of a paragraph. Everyone else was unmemorable. I couldn't care less if anyone lived or died. Nothing really made much sense. And don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the Thirteenth Floor and the Matrix (though the sequels were blech!). Christopher Nolan did a great job with Memento and Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, but OMG, what was everyone thinking? Apparently, I, too, am in a nightmare, looking at the great reviews. And while the special effects were eye-catching, they were not mind boggling. Two clenched fists for this one. Methinks now, I'll just go and watch Green Lantern and do myself in.",0
I have tried to watch this film twice now but found it boring and shallow. I could not relate to any character and did not care about the outcome. Why are we supposed to care about the fate of this man and his shallow mission? It is not like he was doing anything important or life changing. Over rated and like some have said style of substance,0
"Famous for a script that was so complicated even the actors themselves didn't understand what was going on, Inception is one of Christopher Nolan's most famous films, which, given his string of popular movies, is saying something. It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels. In the film, it's Leonardo DiCaprio's job to put his clients to sleep, then enter their dream subconscious and find out information they need. It gets much more complicated, but for the sake of saving your brain, that's the plot in a nutshell.Nolan recruited an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in one of his first dramatic roles. While everyone tries very hard to give serious, dramatic performances to thrill and move the audience, it doesn't always come across that way. Marion seems like she's trying to remember how to speak English, Joe seems like he's desperately trying to get the audience to forget he was ever in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and Leo looks like he's out of tears and thinks a wrinkled face will be just as convincing.The special effects of the film absolutely deserved the hype and the Academy Award, as scenes literally bend and crumble into one another as the different dream sequences blend. If you love movies with incredible special effects, this is a must-see.If you even mention the title to anyone who's seen it, it'll no doubt spark an hour long discussion about what the story and ending meant. I watched the film, and with the exception of a couple of little details during the dream-within-a-dream sequences, I understood it perfectly. To me, the ending was not one that needed discussion, so I don't quite understand the reason behind everyone's endless debates. However, if that type of story intrigues you, you might want to watch this one with your friends so you can stay up late afterwards and talk about what you think it meant.",0
"I generally like the stuff Christopher Nolan does, but Inception did nothing for me. Within 5 minutes of watching the movie and hearing Lucas Haas's cringe-worthy line of ""No, it's my dream""(not a direct quote, but it was something to that effect) I almost fell to the floor laughing. Bad writing happens even in good movies, so I figured it was just a slip-up...except every scene felt like a repeat of those first 5 minutes. I'm not going to go line for line on everything wrong with Inception because if you really want to find out if you're going to like this movie or not, I suggest watching it for yourself. I came in with high expectations and saw a really bad film. You're more than welcome to disagree with my opinion but I hate it when people won't accept someone not liking a critically-acclaimed movie because it goes against the tide. I only say this because when telling someone how I disliked Inception I was quickly informed that ""I didn't get it"". It's a film about a team going into people's minds and heisting their dreams to plant suggestions that potentially affect real life choices. It's an interesting concept that was poorly executed. I ""got it"", but I just didn't like it.",0
"I tried to watch Inception again on the TV one day, to give the movie a second chance, mainly since I lately discovered Tom Hardy and I wanted to see him in there.Tom Hardy was-as usual-a delight to watch, but unfortunately he was the only one not to be ridiculed by the stupid dialogues of this movie.I know Inception has many many fans, but I can' t really understand why.I suppose that many will tell me I did not understand the movie. I do not think I have such problems, especially with movies so naive and pretentious such as this total fiasco that instead of passing for masterpiece in film history should find its place in the panorama of biggest failures in film history, together with much more valuable movies that went overlooked.The way Nolan-who must take himself for a genius-heads for the dream world is superfluous, nonpoetic, mechanistic, and incoherent(he jumps from one idea to another leaving them all in suspense and we are supposed to buy that this reflects the nature of the plot).Perhaps his original idea was an interesting one but he needed a scriptwriter to make something of it.He preferred to do it all by himself, filling the story with clichés and dialogues so stupid that they are unbearable to watch and listen to.There is no philosophical background, only a pretentious plot that is supposed to mean something, and most of all it is aiming at impressing the audience, and in that it succeeded perfectly.I consider it a blasphemy to put Inception next to 2001 or Blade runner;instead I would suggest a comparison with David Cronenberg's Existenz;it's not Cronenberg's best film but it gives Nolan a lesson what messing with another reality means.Finally, I understand that these views I expose here are about to be the target of attack by many devoted fans.I can not but accept this position.PS. I am heading for Intersterlar one of these days, I never learn;I already read people are in love with this movie too.I hope I fall in love too, but I have great reservations as I do not trust the director at all!I'll be back, however, with another review, since I've decided to fight for what I consider right these days(and to support great films I still have the pleasure to watch,like- very recently- the Judge and the Drop)",0
"I had read many reviews, citing this movie to be one of the best movie ever made, and as it was a nolan's work and starring dicaprio, I was very enthusiastic about this movie, i thought I was in for a ride.this movie was about dreams, so a perfect combination to be a masterpiece.This movie revolves around cobb(dicaprio), who is a skilled thief, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. but this job had cost him everything he had ever loved. he is given a chance to get his old life back by saito(watanabe), in exchange of a job to be considered impossible. cobb takes it, assemble a team consisting of Arthur(levitt), Aridne(page), Eames(hardy), Yusuf(rao).but despite being a impossible task, nobody knows that their life is at risk because of a factor related to cobb's wife mal(cottilard).then the whole movie is about how they complete the job.the plot is fresh and exciting. the performances are brilliant. the movie is visually appealing, and demands active participation from viewers, which is good thing. the motive is good, but execution fails. the movie has brain , no heart.there is nothing to take back home after watching this movie except the complexity. also in the mid, you will know what the else is all about. this movie does not provide enough thrills, to consider it as a thriller. I am writing this review after such a time, because of such a hype this movie has got, which is not fair. we all know Nolan can do much better than this. I have seen all his movies, and he is certainly one of the best director alive. but he has to learn more from other such as Scorsese, movies are not all about technicality, there should be an emotion. movie should be able to teach something, and if the execution is able to does that, then the movie becomes a masterpiece, and an exception. Nolan has shown previously that he is capable of doing this in insomnia,the prestige, and batman trilogy.despite from all this, the movies has its moments.it fall shorts to become a masterpiece, and it hurts us.nolan has also continued his trademarks, leaving the ending to be interpreted by the viewer,....whether the cobb has return to the real world, or he is in the dreams at the end(cobb spins the top...but the top is not shown to stop and fall).",0
A film that starts with much promise and for the first half hour or so works well before descending into farce. The idea of being sent into someone's subconscious or dream state is fascinating but when it comes to the point that someone is sent into a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream it just becomes ridiculous and on this occasion it does not work. Christopher Nolan is a fine Director/screen writer with a tremendous back catalogue of movies and will no doubt add to this back catalogue with more gems as his career continues but Inception is not one of them. Not a terrible movie but not a good one either. If you want to waste an hour and forty odd minutes of your time then go ahead and watch it but there are far better movies that exist.,0
"Beyond boring, had to turn it off. The story line is retarded, it is very confusing. The only reason I would even give it one star is because Leonardo and the girl from Juno are good. The special effects were overdone and so unrealistic it made it even more boring. The whole concept of this movie is so unrealistic I can't even take it. ""projections of my subconscious?"". Dreams within dreams within dreams within dreams I am bored to tears watching this movie. Dreams come alive and then dreams and subconscious and dreams you just can't control, I guess I am into realistic movies. This movie is crap and I would seriously suggest sticking needles in your eyes before I watched this, that would be seriously more entertaining.",0
"After several weeks of hearing praise about Inception from friends, critics, and glowing reviews on IMDb, I finally gave in and took my wife to see it this weekend. I really wanted to love this movie as I am a huge fan of most Sci-Fi and Ellen Page. My wife usually loves Leonardo and Ellen.We could not have been more disappointed with this train wreck of a movie. We were both bored and ready to leave the theater after the first 45 minutes but stuck it out till the end hoping for something good that never came. We agreed that it was one of the WORST films we have ever seen in our lifetimes.Yes - we did GET the gist of the convoluted plot, but the dialog and visuals were at times laughable and silly as Christopher Nolan force-fed the audience with course after course of nonsensical explanations of how dreams work, their layers, and the non-specific techniques the poorly defined characters would use for ""extraction"" and their ""inception"" caper.I felt zero attachment to any of the characters in the story and didn't much care about their fate. If you've seen the trailer you've seen ALL of the cool special effects nearly in their entirety. The much-ballyhooed scenes that involve floating people were just ripped-off variations of similar scenes from The Matrix series.The only explanation I have for the popularity of Inception is my theory that more than 70% of theater audiences fell asleep during the first 10 minutes and dreamed that they saw a good film.If you want to experience excitement in dreams, just lay down and take a nap. Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this boring mess.",0
"i cant believe how overrated this film is! its been done so many times before. dark city, matrix, the cell even nightmare on elm street (going in to grab freddy, and being awoke by a friend, alarm clock or candle), which are all better. i cant see anything original at all about this script and can imagine there will be lots of forums discussing the confusing story line. if you want this sort of deep film your better off with 12 monkeys or vanilla sky. i feel as if I've wasted two and a half hours of my life and 15 pounds out of my pocket. very very disappointed. everything leonardo di caprio does always seems to get lots of praise, but can only think of a handful of good films he has done.",0
"Christopher Nolan burst to stardom with the stunningly good, low-budget Memento. Since then, his hubris has got the better of him, and the more money he has to spend on movies the worse they become.Inception is all splash - yet positively awful. It is classic blockbuster in the sense that all critics were bought off with its excessive promotional budget. How every single critic gave this rubbish maximum ratings can only be explained by a bribe (do the math: as an example, a $20M budget to buy off all of ~500 critics is about $40,000 per reviewer. The difference between a 2-star and a 4-star rating will guarantee to translate to much more than $20M).All huge-budget blockbusters are the same. This one has reached the zenith of promotional ingenuity.The movie is not complex as many dodos would believe. It is boringly slow and attempts to be convoluted just so you can be duped into thinking it is deep and meaningful. The best part of the film is the last 10 seconds - the only true suspense happens in these few moments. Ironically I got pleasure from seeing my partner fall asleep during the last hour : at the end of the movie I was very curious to know if she remembered her dream ...",0
"I wish to god that IMDb would allow you to vote with a minus rating because, if I could i would rate this movie -10. This is the all time worst movie of my life and I want the 2 and a half hours back. While watching this junk I actually thought i was dreaming and in a bad nightmare, then the phone rang and I realized that I was just watching a horrible peace of sh!!!!T. I actually signed up for this site just for this dirty peace of toilet paper they call a script. I had to watch this movie in four parts not being able to stomach more than 40 minutes at a time. To keep it plain and simple I would not even make someone on death row watch this movie even if it was his last request. Let me plant an Inception in your head and tell you not to watch this movie. It's movies like this that put Block Buster out of business and why movie sales are down.",0
"One is a rate to balance properly the fanatic reviews here. This is a good movie. But is impossible that this movie flies above from the source: The Matrix. Inception is a rip-off and comes 10 years late for a chance to be consider original. Well, that's it. Good soundtrack,good cinematography, but none original. The effects are pretty good, but not jaw dropping. The plot is just complex, but not intelligent .Nolan has not been nominee for Academy Award and that is fair. If the Watchoski was not too, why should be Nolan? I recommend people to watch this movie. But I recommend those people don't surf the hype. Otherwise they will be catch in Nolan's marketing.",0
"Watch South Park's take on this...It looks nice, but it is totally incoherent. Just a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. Music used to manipulate, not enhance. I am going to fill the rest of this review with words because I am required to do so by the site. This review will perfectly mirror the movie as a result, because after the first two lines there is absolutely, positively, without question not an angstrom of a reason for you to continue reading. It's just that I hate this movie so much that I am willing to waste my time typing like this so as to bring the ratings down even in this sadly microscopic way since it is overwhelmingly loved for reasons that are just simply beyond my small little mind. Are we at ten lines yet? Whew.",0
"Inception, by Christopher Nolan, is a summer blockbuster that many people are walking out of, feeling absolutely blown away by 2.5 hours of high-budget special effects and shoot-'em-up action, and a seemingly intricate plot. People are talking about this film as a ""sophisticated, intelligent thriller"", having been thoroughly hypnotized by the bright colors, loud music and sound effects.We're interested in approaching popular culture to critique and engage. We simply didn't find much value in this movie. Here's why: 6.Glorification of Masculine Violence: Inception features millions of dollars in special effects, and is mostly men shooting at each other. Glorifying the violent male reinforces patriarchal patterns of violence. The film employs a few tricks to sneak by with a PG-13 rating: by placing almost all the violence in the ""dream world"" thus making it not ""real""; by having almost no blood in the film; and by having characters use a silencer for many of the gun battles (a classic James Bond trick). To Hollywood studios, including Warner Bros. which released Inception, celebrating fighting and killing is easy money. To the Motion Picture Association (an industry group in charge of rating movies for family consumption) marketing violence to kids is okay when the victims are ""projections"".5.No Originality: Inception borrows elements (like the ski chase, van chase, unlimited explosive charges, etc.) from action classics like James Bond, the Matrix and the Star Wars trilogy, but offers nothing original to the genre. The film' simple plot is boring despite the special effects. We were hoping for a characteristic Nolan plot twist at the end to save the film, but no such luck.4.Normalization of Violence: against Black People There is not a single speaking black character in the movie. A scene of gratuitous violence takes place in Mombasa, Kenya (actually shot in Tangiers, Morocco), a city full of black Africans. In the five minute Mombasa chase sequence, many black Mombasans are pushed out of the way by Leo or shot by his pursuers. The black character who appears for the longest time exists solely to lose a fight with Arthur in a hallway with shifting gravity. Images of violence against black bodies reinforce the racist dominant framework that this is routine and acceptable.3.Lack of Diversity: Out of a six-person dream infiltration team there are two male members of color and one white woman, but all of the impressive action is taken by the three white men. One man is a vaguely middle-eastern type, whose job it is to supply the drugs, and drive the van. He has few lines and displays no ability to fight beyond some shooting from the driver's seat of the van. The other is a benevolent Japanese capitalist who supplies the money and connections. Then once the action starts he gets shot right away, becoming dead weight for the other (white) characters and kept alive only to reunite DiCaprio's character with his family at the end. The lack of diversity is boring. Like all action films, this one has the potential to feature women and people of color in powerful roles, but conspicuously fails to do so.2.Cheerleading for Capitalism: The film attempts to construct a moral foundation for the operation of sneaking into a target's subconscious to plant an idea. The central mission of the team is to bring down a near-monopoly (the Fisher family's domination of the ""energy industry""), in favor of an oligopoly led ostensibly by the grandfatherly Japanese capitalist (Ken Watanabe) and a few other ""smaller"" companies. The message is that multiple companies in an industry creates competition, and thus is a check on corporate rule. In reality we see many corporations working together to profit from destructive resource extraction and exploitation of labor. The film attempts to persuade the audience to root for the victory of one corporation against another but fails to draw moral contrast between its protagonists and their target.1.Cliché Hetero-Monogamous Love Story: The motivations of our hero, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) are based in a cheesy subplot about his relationship with wife and kids. The attempt to ""humanize"" Cobb, an otherwise violent character, essentializes both woman and children. The wife is jealous, scheming, and hysterical while the kids are faceless, silent and angelic. We like the spunk of Ariadne (Ellen Page), a smart and confident woman but she serves merely as a foil to Cobb whose wife, kids and crush, Ariadne, hold the whole emotional weight that the plot rests on. The films' dependence on a shallow emotional story weakens the plot and characters.",0
"In my eyes this movie was awful. Now most people who I've told my opinion have accused me of being ""simple"" and ""not understanding it"". I believe I understood the movie very well, I appreciate Nolan's original idea and effort. It's just a shame that this idea is a piece of garbage. I enjoy intelligent movies, but there is nothing intelligent or even remotely exciting about people going into dreams, and then into dreams, and then into dreams again. The whole idea is simply ridiculous, and when Leonardo and Ariadne are in a dream together and Ariadne starts moving a huge glass door around - what on earth? Moving on to Leonardo, I cannot understand how such a poor, boring and depressive actor gets so much fame. I'm assuming this is all because of Titanic, but his role in Inception is shockingly boring and bad. And am I the only one who seems to see a pattern in Leo's movies (in both Inception and Shutter Island Leonardo's wife is dead, but he seems to think that she isn't)? Anyway, out of all the cast only Tom Hardy playing Eames is remotely likable. After seeing Cilian Murphy in some other brilliant roles (e.g. 28 Days Later) I was extremely disappointed while watching him become more miserable with every second in Inception. Leonardo's sidekick Arthur is plain annoying. I wish there had been more action in this movie other than in the scene in the snowy place. Aside from that, Inception is just a lot of talking about complete nonsense and lots of views of Leonardo's scared, confused face. Christopher Nolan made this movie way too ""intelligent"". The end result is tragic. One of the most overrated movies ever.",0
"Nice try at making a movie that isn't a remake, sequel, or based on a book. Doesn't work in the end, though. Transparent, easy-to-guess plot with no twists, ho-hum action scenes, and no real conflict. And the key to the main character knowing he's in the ""real world"" is that he has a top that never stops spinning?!?! Huh? Did anyone check the script to realize that perpetual motion belongs in the DREAM part of this movie?Clumsy film. I love sci-fi, love Nolan's other flicks, even thought DiCaprio was pretty good, but didn't make up for such boredom and nonsense. This is far from a ""masterpiece."" Basically it's a remake of the Matrix for people who thought the Matrix was ""too sci-fi"".",0
"I will rate this movie on characters/script, acting, plot, production and an x-factor. The characters in this movie have no personality or depth. Worse, because you cannot sympathise with them in any way, they add a clichéd sob story for the main character, to fill the gap left by a clinical inability to project any humanity onto him, through the use of dialogue. Score = 1/10. The acting is OK. Average. But with no characters to act, I would imagine this isn't hard. Score = 3/10. The plot is complicated (for a movie), fast paced and based on the most spurious, simplistic and quasi-scientific description of the human mind. It demands that you concentrate to keep up, so it is very disappointing to realise that your efforts are unrewarded. There are logical, philosophical, scientific and psychological flaws with every turn of the plot, and it isn't even consistent in these. This makes it a very boring movie to watch so a big fat 1/10 for plot. Production is good. Nice special effects with a big budget. 7/10. So far we have 12/40, which is 3/10. This means I would have to give -7/10 for x-factor, in order to arrive at a final score of 1/10, which is what this movie deserves, because it claims to be so much that it is not. So x-factor gets -7/10 exactly.",0
"I remember when they (and Chris Nolan) used to make films about people and their dilemma's. The actual conflict in Inception is just an after-thought to appease. Cobb's issue about wanting to see his children is so tired and played out it is almost laughable. With all the attention that went into the dream process, maybe Nolan could have spent a little more time with human elements of the film.Whether it's a wife who killed her children or a wife who killed herself and left children, we are tired of Leo as the grieving husband (Inception/Shutter Island). Clearly this film was to showcase cleverness in concept and effects. The story is a bare-bones, hackneyed joke.Even the mission is a yawner. Who cares about the rich kid and his rich dad- you don't even get to know them so why care? None of the relationships are below the surface so there is nothing invested in the story.Movies are about relationship, conflict and story. All of these elements are after-thoughts in INCEPTION! This is strictly a concept film whose execution of CGI is way more special then it's attention to story.",0
"It is so unnecessary and fairly persuasive; unsuccessfully, insistingly imposing the audience there is a great mystery going on but weak fiction just causes a perception of a confusing and boring movie in you. Full of very irritating logical errors, incoherence and lack of intelligence. Categorically, this kind of movies are not science fiction, they are action movies because there is no science going on in them. By the way, there's no mystery about dreaming, your brain is just rearranging the randomly recorded data during the day; defragmenting them according to their relations and deleting the unnecessary ones.",0
"This movie is way too talky and confusing to enjoy. Add to that a director/writer with absolutely zero sense of humor and wit, and we are left with this dry onslaught on your senses. I think Mr Nolan may have brains and be some people's cup of tea, but his humorless and emotionless films have all left me extremely disappointed. INCEPTION in particular was torture for me. There is absolutely no payoff by the end of the film because we do not care about any of these characters. If it were not for the genius score, this could easily be the worst waste of time I have had in a movie theater in years.I see there is some controversy and speculation as to where all the rave reviews are coming from. It's possible that there are many who do love this film. But they weren't in our packed audience. One person clapped at film's end, and it quickly died when no one joined in. Instead most people bolted for the doors after this overlong dud.",0
"I felt like I was in a dream within a dream as I sat back in my comfy movie theater seat and sank into the multiple dream worlds of Mr. Leonardo di Caprio. If you're a big fan of mazes and word search, then you'll be thrilled and horrified by Inception. A jauntily bescarfed Miss Ellen Paige joins a crack team of serious-faced crazy dream thieves who forget to tell her certain rules and regulations until after they're inside the dream. Or maybe it was another dream within a dream, I'm not sure and I can't remember. How many times I've forgotten to tell people important things too, until it's too late. This happens at work frequently. So I understand Miss Paige's nervousness and excitement, but luckily she is more than skilled enough to figure out how the heck someone can wiggle their way into Mr. Di Caprio's personal dreams and pointlessly stare at the zit on Miss Marianne Cotillard's French forehead. Confusion? Sure! Irritation? Guaranteed. Pointless gunfights? You ask for it, you got it. But as long as you can remember that 10 minutes in real life equals four hours in the dream world, you'll be happy as a clam as you watch a Ford Econoline van take nearly two hours to fall into the water. It's a fun time for all. Realistic yet completely unrealistic at the same time. Where's my totem? I can't tell if I'm in a dream or a nightmare when I watch Inception!",0
"I'm really tired of American movies ripping off foreign films, specifically animes. The Matrix did it with Ghost in the Shell. Now Inception does it with Paprika.I went into this having already seen Paprika, which I thought had a MUCH better story. Because of this I just couldn't see how ""complex"" and ""amazing"" it was. The story is about a thief who can travel through dreams. Inception is the idea of changing someones decisions based on infiltrating their dreams and affecting their subconscious. The acting is not bad, a bit predictable though in the Hollywood sense...Overall, it was a decently executed rip-off, but nothing spectacular. It's a shame that the original Paprika never got even half the attention of this subpar version.",0
"Superficially, you know when this one winds to a close that you've just spent two and a half hours with the results of an over supportive studio giving Christopher Nolan, fresh from his huge Batman successes, way too much leeway.It's a bloated, convoluted, over-extended and ponderous film that has almost no reward in store for viewers when all's said and done. But still, even as you secretly hope it'll be the next Ishtar or Cutthroat Island, you know it's wrong to think like that. You know there was still a truckload of vision and good intentions involved in the making of Inception, and you keep thinking that maybe this is the rare summer movie to attempt delivery of an intelligent construct to generally numb and switched off audiences.The truth lies somewhere in between. Inception suffers from some factual failings that can't be denied - it's too long, for one. Then, the plot turns out surprisingly thin, so in order to fill the runtime, Nolan and Co resorted to severe repetition, so we're put through the same sequences time and again. Yet, there's no tension. You can figure out the entire affair for yourself in advance. Do not expect any twists when going into Inception, and actually the most tense moment comes right at the end, although we suspect that's because you're worried the suspense is leading into yet another scene.Then, we get to the performances. Nobody does a really bang up job here, although no one falls too short of the mark. DiCaprio delivers basically the same character he was in Blood Diamond and Body of Lies, except he doesn't yell at the people on the phone as much this time. Otherwise it's the same reluctant gun for hire routine. He plays the oddly named Dom Cobb, a specialist in extraction. That's not a dental reference, it just means he's a dream hacker, able to infiltrate the sleeping minds of others and steal valuable information. This dream world is presented as a virtual reality straight out of The Matrix, including hostile locals and bizarre physics.Cobb gets hired for one more big job by a powerful industrialist (Ken Watanabe), who needs his talents to interdict a rival family (Cillian Murphy and Pete Postlethwaite). But Cobb can't do the job alone, so he puts together an entire crew, including assistant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), among others. The job becomes increasingly complicated, though, mostly because Cobb is haunted by his beloved wife (Marion Cotillard), who's somewhat of an antagonist, albeit a rather mundane and annoying one.What ensues exposes the failings of Inception. The narrative is just too long for it's own good, and presented in a manner that promotes repetition over ingenuity, despite the vision we mentioned before. Inception takes obvious cues from previous science fiction and surrealism entries, but at least it's honest enough to not dwell on the technicalities of just how Cobb and his posse manage to penetrate other people's dreams like that. Aside from the positive, there are mostly negatives, as you're compelled out of some basic decency to keep watching, hoping for things to take a swing in the right direction. That never happens, and Inception remains a middling exercise in over extension start to finish.Most of the effort and talent here have evidently gone towards the visual richness of the feature, which doesn't disappoint. There are some excellent effects, landscapes, costumes and settings involved, but they're not enough to distract from the overall emptiness of this movie. Were it 30 minutes shorter, then maybe Inception could have been commendable for aesthetic endeavor, but as it stands, those pluses are drowned by the lacking storytelling on show. While not a complete disaster, Inception will get you started on the path to your next movie outing real quick.",0
"Really, this was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was Sci-Fi at its worst - a thoroughly impossible idea unmitigated by any shade of Well, Maybe. And it was compounded by the fun ability of the movie-makers to cut and paste the scenes in an unconnected fashion, making a whole that is absolutely incomprehensible. This isn't brilliant, it is bizarre. It isn't entertaining, because certainly if you go for entertainment and have to spend the entire 2 hours and 28 minutes figuring it out you will feel cheated and bored, not entertained. How a movie like this gets so many high ratings is a mystery and makes me worry. Will all movies go in this direction? Maybe its a cult movie, maybe that's it. There is plenty of ""action"" (read, endless fights, car chases, etc.), and the sound track is Really Loud. At one point most of the characters are for some unclear reason in the same white space-like suits with white head gear that hides their faces. You see anonymous white suits battling it out. You go from Who's who? to Who cares? in a very short time. This is a great movie to go to if you generally spend your time in the movies texting or otherwise not paying attention. Miss this one if you can.",0
"I had a review all written up but after reading many others, most of what blows about this film has been covered. I'll keep it brief.However, I didn't put much faith into a review from anyone who didn't like it but uses a phrase something like, ""maybe I'm just not clever enough..."" That kind of sentiment pretty much speaks for itself. It has some good ideas but then hell, so do I. I have some great plot devices and mind-benders. But there's the problem of writing a story with interesting characters and dialogue and conflict and resolution and...you get it? Nolan has the plot devices and the mindbleep ending and a bunch of Crisco® in between.I agree with others who have stated in their reviews, if he was willing to broach this subject he should have done more research and dug a little deeper. The possibilities were endless and I was hoping for something far more challenging. Then again based on the returns, I guess this was the way to go. Meat for men and milk for babes. This film is milk.",0
"Inception?Incomprehension is more like it.Techno-babble, psycho-babble, and just plain babble fill a third of the film, providing the audience with the rules of the game and the back story of the main character. Unfortunately, much of it is unnecessary and difficult to follow and takes the place of character interaction, character growth, and emotion. Inception is a gargantuan, cinematic meditation on dreams and reality. Zzzzzz. That's the sound of me snoring.The only thing worse than being bored at a film is being bored AND not giving a crap. And that's the case here. There's not a single character to care about. Oh sure there is a preponderance of cool effects, people hanging weightless in time and space and climbing on ceilings, but without a cohesive narrative or anyone to root for, they're just pretty images flashing on a big screen at a frenetic pace.Don't get me wrong, somewhere there is a good film here. Or at least there could have been. But as it stands it is a story not well told.Which is easier to explain: the plot of this film or the praise hefted upon it by critics and everyone else on this forum? Has Christopher Nolan risen to the level of Marty Scorsese and James Cameron where films are lauded despite whatever self-indulgent, effects-laden dreck they put on the screen?All throughout Inception I wanted to shoot myself so that I could wake up from this bad movie. Unfortunately my top stopped spinning and the reality set in: another lousy film in the Summer of 2010. Wake me when it's over.",0
"The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings. It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race. The only thing I got from watching this horrible overrated bloated cinematic experiment was a wish to kill myself. Maybe I'm dreaming, too?",0
"My wife and I fell for all the hype and went to this monstrosity of a film. I tried very hard to ""get it,"" but my wife just fell asleep. I appreciate the objective of venturing into the wonders of Dreamland, but I've gone nighty-night every night for nearly 63 years without ANYTHING remotely resembling any level of any of the dreams portrayed. My first problem with the film was the basic technical premise of one person being able to get inside another person's dreams. OK, I was willing to accept the concept on faith, but here you have a bunch of supposedly brilliant characters explaining it to each other, and their explanations lurched between ""sophomoric"" and ""incoherent."" Then, accepting the dubious premises of the story, you have this idea that the dream compresses time as compared to reality, so the dream within the dream compresses time even further, and so forth. OK, I'll buy that, but the EFFECT of this is that when we're two HOURS into the movie, suddenly everything is going VERY slowly. We watch that van falling imperceptibly toward the water, and although there's a lot of hyperkinetic action going on at the other levels, my wife is sound asleep and I'm asking myself whether it will take all night for that damn van to hit the water so we can all go home. And while all this is going on, who within the story do we really care about? The dead wife? The cute chick who was supposed to be so smart, but just kind of sits there and doesn't do much as the plot unfolds? The rich guy whose brains are being used as an Interstate Freeway and shooting gallery for some other rich guy's advantage? Leonardo? Forget it. He's like Captain Ahab chasing the whale, but at least Ahab had the good grace to go down to his death with the whale. The only ones I could empathize with were the two little kids, and they've turned their back on their father. I don't blame them.",0
"yes... something's definitely not right. IMDb must have been taken over by a horde of Nolan's fans, or maybe is this all just a bad dream, it just can't be true, no... Please someone send me a kick in order me to wake up because this movie can't possibly be ranking 3rd in IMDb Top 250...I mean, come on ! there's nothing more to this movie than to any other action scenes centered summer blockbusters.People who describe its narrative structure as complicated must have a hell of time using a lift in a building, because, really... it just gets as complicated as that...And switching at a high rate between the layers doesn't add any depth, just get the whole ensemble a little confusing for short attention span people at best...The plot is completely shallow, we don't even care one second about the characters, it's just all about action. Is Nolan able to dream only about gunshot and some buildings scrambling into the sea... well that's quite sad...What's the most resilient parasite ? A idea, no... a heavy marketed movie, unfortunately, yes...",0
"Definitely not a 9 out of 10, or a top 250 movie. I have an idea, let's fabricate a semi-comprehensible plot which is grounded so feebly in reality that it's meaning can be subject to anyone's interpretation. Therefore critics will refuse to pan it out of fear of being perceived as idiots, the public will refuse to criticize it out of fear of being perceived as shallow, and everyone else will wonder what they've missed. Oh, and to top the cupcake with a cherry, we'll deliver an ending which offers no resolution. It can't fail! The concept of reality vs. fantasy was definitely better delivered in The Matrix...and this movie is not its equal or even a strong competitor. The concept of dream invaders was dealt with much more enjoyably in Dreamscape (1984), and was much easier to comprehend. This movie was more of an enigma burrito wrapped in a layer of fantasy tortilla, topped with sour-cream special effects, and hyped by popular salsa. Get it? Only the most hippest and most intelligent can understand my allegorical comparison!",0
"The movie is clearly carried out in two phases: the first one lets you in on what the main character does, hints at the monsters in his closet, and assembles the team to carry out the biggest job of their lives. It is a strained attempt at generating feeling that something big will happen when they get to the second part. The second part is a three-tier dream with a distinct design at each level with an additional fourth one that appears when the bottom drops down.For something as visually elaborate as this film is, it lacks a good character conflict. The action concentrates exclusively on the ever-changing and beautifully executed scenery, but the characters are rather two-dimensional and there is no tension between any of them. The only pseudo-villain that we encounter in the film resides within the main character, and the villainry is better represented through fear it generates in other characters than through its actions. The ""villain"" barks louder than it bites. The film concentrates too heavily on the effects while lacking in basic character development. It ends up being too benign, too flat, too plain.True, there are many good concepts that find representation in the film: the yoga of dreams, lucid dreaming, NLP techniques of programming people into doing what you want, etc. Any somewhat-read person would clearly see the roots of ideas in this movie. The off-the beaten-path-ness of the concepts does not make them brand new, though. And for anyone who reads, this is a rather opportunistic film in a sense that it capitalizes on the fact that most will never read a thing about lucid dreams or anything in that general area of knowledge, thus pitching its concepts to an average film-goer as something revolutionary. Despite tons of visual effects, it is an easy film to follow, perhaps too easy in the light of the hype that leads one to expect more for your brain to feast on. Instead, all your brain gets is crumbs.This film feels like a mutant baby of ""The Cell"" and ""The Matrix"". It is fun to watch at times, although scenes with the main character and his wife are mercilessly stretched, well beyond what is necessary to deliver the idea.It is amazing that the man whose subconscious is penetrated does not put up a better fight despite his training in dream security. On the second level of the dream he just surrenders and is led like a lamb to slaughter. And you say this man was trained to defend himself when someone invades his subconscious? That's a plot hole, and a big one. Besides, who better to play a well-equipped villain than Cillian Murphy? He needs more depth and more screen time than he was given this time around. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, on the other hand, is scrumptious and understatedly sexy, a hot brainiac who can even create a kick in absence of gravity. Now that is impressive. What's a kick? See the movie. Just don't expect too much, if you are a well-read, well-traveled old soul. If not, you are gonna love it.",0
"Just finished watching Inception and boy was it a painful experience... Will not even attempt a recap since it is way too convoluted and I lost interest 30 minutes in. How such a movie van receive so many accolades is beyond my comprehension, but then again, quite a few recent stinkers have been praised as masterpieces.What a waste of talent and money! Seems Nolan adopted the J.J.Abrams jerky camera style, little character development, almost no storyline and as much special effects as the budget allows. This is a great recipe for flotsam and Inception fits snugly in that category.",0
"Frankly, I don't see how all these people vote for 8. Inception is such a claustrophobic and overwhelming movie. The whole movie is extremely boring and isn't containing any funny moment. Yes, we are all know that this is not a comic. But the movie is going so serious when there's nothing to be serious about.""A dream within a dream,"" may look like an interesting subject. However, we see that Nolan couldn't handle the subject very well. We can confirm that. Dialogues are cliché, simple and dysfunctional. Obviously, film was made for simple audience.This is so sad. Inception is a stain on Top 250 list.",0
"Inception indeed sports a stellar cast and its ratings have been an unqualified success. However, in spite of such commendations, this film is at best mediocre. It reeks of the residue of the Matrix and has elements of other much-loved dream caper films such as the Nightmare on Elm Street series of yesteryear.The special effects are mind-blowing, the acting is par excellence, but the concept itself - rather than being sublime, is in fact nothing spectacular at all. The gist of it is that Di Caprio's character is able to enter the minds and dreams of his subjects. He plants seeds to uncover data and everyone becomes interlocked in the same dream, with surprising twists and turns.The twist in the film - let's leave that to the audience to uncover - is hardly worth the running time of the film and what it promises in terms of high-impact mind-blowing content falls short of films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Overall, it's nothing more than a high-tech visual extravaganza of spectacular stunts and a seemingly LSD-induced storyline.",0
"At first I found myself caught up in the action and enjoying it. Then I got tired of the music -- all it did was create tension -- then I realized I didn't care about *any* of the characters. Then it got boring. I no longer cared about what happened next; it had become predictable. As a kid I read a lot of science fiction and thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked The Dark Knight and Momento. But this is not like those films. It is poor science fiction, poor drama. It fails in all the important ways that good drama succeeds: characters we care about; genuine emotional connection among the characters; an ebb and flow to the rhythm of the movie, with respite from the intensity; balance; a plot that has integrity. This movie felt like an unending jackhammer. It's a wannabe Matrix.We no longer cared, we felt assaulted. When they began the third level, we made our move. We walked out.",0
"I didn't like it, Nolan has done much much better work.Memento is in another league creatively, TDK a much better action blockbuster, The Prestige a subtle masterpiece.Here's the problems with the movie:1. Ellen Page was miscast, she's too young. Either make her 5 years younger or 5 years older. If older she'd be a love interest, if younger she'd be an amazing prodigy.2. Her prowess and quick acceptance were unbelievable. There needed to be a scene where she proved herself to LeoDC at the school, some amazing ability.3. The script was overly simplistic because they needed to explain the intricate plot. Example: the snow level when they go over the timing of the levels again to remind the audience things happen at different perceived times the deeper down you go. As if the constant shots of the slowly falling van weren't enough. Let's not even discuss the ridiculousness that there is a direct correlation of time between levels. I get that the deeper you go the more time becomes blurred, but a direct numerical correlation?4. Joseph G-L was given no room to show how great an actor he is; his character was stiff and wooden, strange for the ""organizer"".5. LeoDC walked straight off the set of Shutter Island into this movie without changing character. Not his fault, the characters are similar, maybe they should have cast someone else.6. The action sequences, apart from the hotel hallway fight scene, were unoriginal and obligatory, nowhere near TDK. The snow scenes in particular were straight out of an early Bond movie. It would have been better to have left them out completely and spent more time making the movie more complexly layered, with better character development.7. The idea has been done before, and better. The comparison with The Matrix is inevitable, and Inception comes up so lacking.8. The targeting of Cillian Murphy's character was very very mean-spirited, especially since we learn that inception can permanently ruin one's mind and lead to suicide. It's not for revenge, not for patriotism, not for the betterment of mankind, but for corporate greed. It's hard to get behind the characters when they are doing such an ugly thing: targeting a young man who already has major father/son issues because of his successful father, and making those issues much worse. This isn't Ocean's 11 where we don't mind Andy Garcia getting the shaft because we want to see George Clooney get Tess, and Garcia is a jerk anyway. The premise of inception was interesting, but the execution on a complete innocent was downright ugly.Inception was a lot of movies I'd already seen, let's call it Ocean's 11 meets The Matrix, but had none of the light-hearted humor of O11, where I felt the crime was justified, or at least other ""gang heist"" movies so clever and the victim so nameless it didn't really matter.In the end, I feel Inception is going to go down as one of Nolan's worst movies, a clever idea that was made with too high a budget and expectations, such that meaningless action was thrown in, and the film didn't know whether it was a psychological mindbender or an action movie, and wasn't able to pull off both in the manner of the ever-brilliant Matrix.",0
"I have some advice for intelligent people who wish to see a great film about dreams...Watch Mulholland Dr. Instead.I found Inception to be a strange animal, it's almost like a film that has been aimed at cretins to help them feel as though they are intelligent.As far as having my mind blown I found myself still waiting for the ""Blow"" as the film wrapped, following two and a half hours of dull exposition, lacklustre performances, and cliché after cliché all dressed up as the ""next big thing"".I am by no means a ""Nolan hater"" he has made some very solid films up to this point and has real talent, I also do not blame him for this offering as he obviously thought it was good, I blame the easily pleased and intellectually challenged people who have hyped it up to be something it clearly is not.The 3rd greatest film of all time?...Give me a break.",0
I think all the other 1 star voters stated exactly how I feel about this movie. I have never felt motivated to write a movie review in my life. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! My favorite movie reviewer gave it 4/4 stars. I am baffled - - I really feel like I'm missing something... although there seem to be many out there that have the same thoughts I do. Thanks for confirming my opinions! I could tell within five minutes of the movie that I was not going to like it and that I wouldn't be able to follow it. Should have walked out then. I am the most sympathetic person to characters in a movie. I was amazed that I couldn't care less if all of the main characters were shot dead. There was zero character development. I felt a bit nauseous from all of the action and I really coudn't tell what was going on a lot of the time.,0
"As a true science fiction fan and a big fan of Memento, I was really looking forward to a mind-bending science fiction classic.You can't get much more of a creative license than have dreams and dream manipulation as the main subject matter. Any Director worth his salt should be able to really put on something special and I was expecting something spectacular from Christopher Nolan.Calling Inception an anti-climax would be an understatement. It was an utter and complete let-down. The special effects looked more suited to a music video, the character development was non-existent, the plot was simple and one-dimensional and once the movie ended the only thing that I was struggling to figure out was how on earth could so many people be so gullible.What a missed opportunity.If you're really looking for something mind bending that deals with dream states, dream manipulation and altered states of consciousness, try watching the superb 2009 6 part mini-series 'The Prisoner'.",0
"I came into Inception with very high expectations. I'm a huge fan of sci-fi thrillers; Philip K. Dick might be my favorite author, and I love films that raise metaphysical questions in a science fiction context. I've liked a lot of Nolan's stuff (Memento was terrific, Insomnia was pretty good, The Prestige was mediocre, and both of his Batman's were entertaining). I consider myself very good at following along with complicated plots. The movie had gotten terrific reviews already. It seemed like a slam dunk.At about the half-way point, I couldn't decide whether or not Inception was closer to Avatar (mind blowing visuals, mind numbing plot/dialog) or Fight Club (wildly overrated pseudo-intellectual drivel). Whichever one it's closer to, I cannot understand why so many people think that this is a good movie? Nolan takes a clever premise, if not a particularly inventive one, and creates an indecipherable, wildly inconsistent, and soulless film.That is not to say there aren't some redeeming qualities. As I noted before, the premise is pretty clever. The cinematography is really terrific, and a lot of the sets are visually stunning (especially the final scene in the Alps). The score was well put together and was not in the least bit overbearing, the acting was solid, and the editing was crisp and well thought out.The actual plot and dialog, however, are abysmal. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. I'll play along with the fact that people are apparently capable of forming incredibly vivid and complex dreams when under the influence of a sedative, despite the fact that sedatives almost always prevent people from dreaming. I'll even disregard the fact that no real reason is ever given for why the characters in Inception are able to dream together, outside of a what looks like an old Simon Says toy in a briefcase with a bunch of wires running out of it.But that's just the beginning. For some reason, the ""architect"" of the dream is able to control the design and layout of other peoples dreams. How? Your guess is as good as mine. The forger (the always awesome Tom Hardy), is capable of impersonating other people in dreams (even though he looks like himself to members of the team), without any further explanation except for his name. And even though the architect seems to be the only person capable of designing the dream, all of the members in the dream are capable of allowing their subconscious to infiltrate the design. This seems like a rather cheap plot device, as it is only the main character who's subconscious makes any serious intrusions into the dream world, as if none of the other characters have serious psychological demons of their own.There are many other plot holes that I won't get into, but suffice it to say this movie is really a head scratcher, and not in a good way. The dialog is rather silly, and the supporting characters are completely one dimensional and exist only, it seems, to help advance the plot. When confronted with the tremendous revelation that people are actually capable of sharing dreams together, manipulating them, and that this is done routinely in corporate espionage, the budding architect Ariadne treats these revelations as somebody who just saw a particularly cool magic trick. In one particularly laughable seen, Michael Caine's character greets the arrival of his son, wanted for his wife's murder and on the lam from powerful multinational corporations seeking to kill him, with little fanfare or concern, pausing to only briefly chastise him about the abandonment of his children, and then accepting at face value a ridiculous scheme to clear his name, even offering up one of his top pupils to help.This movie was really a disappointment, mainly because it had such great potential. Instead fleshing out the clever premise with well developed characters, and deep, nuanced questions, Nolan bounces back and forth, making up more and more ridiculous rules and twists that govern his dreamworld. This is a very superficial production; it's the epitome of all sizzle and no steak. By the end of the film, I didn't even care enough to be disappointed by the classic non-ending. What a waste.",0
"I watched this twice, once alone and once with some family. We assumed whoever wrote this had eaten some mushrooms because it is utterly insane and yet takes itself so seriously.I cannot see the appeal in this movie, its Nolan's worst in my opinion, but i'm sure you'll love it. Most people do.",0
"I really appreciate that the negative reviews for this film capture its most horrific quality: making people feel smart for understanding a stupid concept.If you showed this movie to a surrealist/dadaist, they would in fact find it incredible: how could so many people find this interesting, or even worth talking about? I've heard more inventive ideas from 5-year-olds than this.Do dreams even work like ""Inception""? No. No. No. God no.This is a psychologist's nightmare. Is this also why the American public have such dreadfully low emotional intelligence? Yes, dreams could be free of things like physical laws, but they are so much more meaningful than ""wee, I can fly!"" Besides gravity, all laws of reality are broken in dreams: people morph into other people, or multiple people can be the same person at the same time, or you can be both yourself and another person. Your bedroom could be your bedroom at one moment, and then also become a prison cell at the same time - and even then, sometimes there's no notion of time at all! The point is that these ""images"", ""feelings"", ""characters"" are driven by emotion, or your brain finally being able to connect 2 things together without pesky reality getting in the way. ""The world is blue like an orange.""Inception literally un-trains the viewer from relating to his/her dreams intelligently. Rendering the amazing experience of dreaming through film is a huge challenge, and so many directors have done it much better justice than this piece of garbage.",0
"Boy i must be very shallow because i found this film one of the most boring films ever! The trailer was pretty good but the movie...not so good..I saw it and i fell asleep,i first fell asleep when that van was falling...i woke up, i even saw a little dream but that van was still falling and i thought to my self..what the hell is happening here?Is this a dream or a nightmare?I see all that reviews saying what a masterpiece this film was..blah blah... and the rating??wow..someone is being generous..So my opinion for this is that if you have trouble sleeping hit this film,it will come so natural you won't know what hit you..I know i am a bad reviewer but this is the truth and nothing but the true in this case..SORRY my opinion",0
"I confess I saw this flick at the theater the day it was released because I had seen the trailers and believed all the hype.Its been a while since seeing the movie, here is what I remember. Its full of amazing special effects, and begins well and I remember feeling that it was going to be a wonderful movie. However, I left disappointed and angry that my hard earned money had been wasted. Who the heck voted for this garbage movie to be on this list of ""Best Movies of all time??? Morons who haven't seen any of the hundreds or thousand of better movies than this polished pile of fecal matter. The plot is too slow, there's too much emphasis on special effects, and although the concept is somewhat original the movie could have been so much better had the dialogue/dialog been more interesting and believable. Maybe, I am in the minority, I just hate this movie, and I don't like that fact that its gets so much praise! Do you people really think this is one of the best movies of all time? It should not even be in the top 100 much less the top ten!Don't see this movie. It's 128 minutes too long with only 2o minutes that is actually worth watching! Don't waste your time with this garbage.Do something more productive like reading a book, clipping nose hairs, vacuuming a beach... anything other than watching InceptionGood Grief!",0
"The film is everything, that Hollywood almost always does wrong; It is technically brilliant, but that's all there really is. There is a huge rush to every new ""turn"" on the plot, which in reality is repetition of the first ""turn"" all the way through. This film has one little idea stretched to 2½ hours. There is nothing surprising during the whole movie. Within the first ½ hour, you'll just know exactly what will be. Very, very boring. The characters are just paper images that do not have a single feeling showing from their faces through the whole movie that you could relate to which would be necessary to make it all even a little bit credible. The acting is very shallow, acting is marionette like; it just serves the goal of a very mediocre director. This is a action movie and not even a decent one. The excuse for constant gunfire and violence is one of the most miserable i've ever seen. In a dream everything is like a action movie all the time!? The custodial path the director takes to explain everything to the audience is just ridiculous. And the rules the director so carefully explains doesn't even concern himself! It seems to me that this movie has been tailored exactly for the target audience of 10-15 years old teenagers who do not care about any foundation. Just for the sake of the limping plot he decides when to follow the rules and when not! Example so that the fans don't have to bother them selves to think; The wake up method; when the van falls, director just decides, they do not wake up (althoug it is earlier made very clear, that this (feeling of falling) is a rock solid method to wake up the dreamers), because he (director/writer) isn't ready yet, so we'll just wait for the van to hit the water, oh my... This just is one of the most embarrassing moments in the movies ever, it destroys the whole idea once and for all. For technical merits, including the apparent complexity of the film, which only consists of couple of parallel dream layers, otherwise it totally useless to search any complexity or layers from the film, they are purely superficial and then the special effects and staging(which are nothing new by the way) i'll give this 3/10, other than that there is really nothing to see or feel about this disaster of a film. Compare to Matrix, which also trips up with it's own cleverness a bit but still manages to transmit the feeling and idea, even a bit philosophical one, to the audience. Something the ""Inception"" never managed to deliver.",0
"As someone who has explored hypnotism in depth, the concepts behind Inception were relatively easy to comprehend, and I enjoyed the novel idea of dreams within dreams within dreams. But the plot does seem to get caught up trying to be too clever with the prologue and epilogue, and I would agree with some critics who accuse it of almost collapsing in on itself. I think it just manages to keep interest, but that may be solely because I have experienced very deep trances in hypnosis, and understood the ideas suggested by the film.Visually the film uses rather interesting spectacle to show how dreams may collapse in on themselves, and tries to keep you guessing as to who is attempting what. It is, at times, stunning to watch. But overall the film fails to develop an interesting idea to the maximum.The acting is reasonable rather than good.Not in the same league as Minority Support (for example) but reasonable sci-fi.",0
"When the film ended, the 18-year old boys start to clap and whoop like they'd just had a religious experience. It reminded me of when I went to Swordfish in the theater years ago with a really hot but REALLY dumb blonde. When that movie ended, she clapped and whooped because she was SO SMART and got it. Unfortunately, there was no post-film alcohol or busty blonde to dull the pain of this evening's experience. In my opinion, Insomnia was Nolan's only good film, and it was really the performance by Pacino that grabbed me. Nolan is a talented version of M. Night Shyamalan, i.e. the Kings of the Twist Ending. This is a pseudo compliment. I don't think Nolan is brilliant nor a great filmmaker. This movie didn't scream intelligence, though it really tries. In addition to making Nolan even more wealthy, I hope the side benefit of this film's success is studios taking on more high budget pet projects that aren't designed to sell happy meals or sequels. Please PLEASE let this be the side benefit to Inception.",0
"Are you kidding me? All this fawning? Just because you don't understand it does NOT mean it's genius. I took my two friends to the packed screening and in the middle of it we all looked at each other truly baffled. Is THIS what all the buzz was about? Overwrought, longgg, confusing and as much as I love Ken Watanabe could you have at least done a take or two where you could actually understand him? Yes, there are a few positives to this thing (Leo is almost always great, and Ellen Page is refreshingly for once not doing her ""Hard Candy"" role) but gawwwwd Chris Nolan is on his truly on his way to becoming the next Shyamalamadingdong. Somebody please tell him to tone it down and focus.",0
"My first IMDb review. Well... My thoughts are so fragmented it's difficult to write a coherent review. This film is so wrong on so many levels, it's hard for me to contain myself. The rating and reviews are proof of nothing but one thing, society is now dumb. That may sound harsh, but after thinking my way through the childish attempt to delve into existentialism, the moral bankruptcy, the flat characters, the attempt at creating 'cool' then that is the decision I've reached.It failed to deliver on every single level, even the special effects were so in-your-face that even they became irritating (Surely if an entire street is both below, and above you simultaneously, wouldn't it go a bit dark?).If you want a high concept film then rent Primer, if you want a film to make you think, rent Waking Life or Fight Club, if you want excitement, rent The Bourne Identity or something, anything, just please don't see this film, unless you've never ever ever questioned the reality around you, and you're thick, then maybe you should see it... Arrrgggghhhhh.To sum up a large part of the ""concept"" of this ""masterpiece"", here's Inception without wasting your time and money.""The great Taoist master Chuang Tzu once dreamt that he was a butterfly fluttering here and there. In the dream he had no awareness of his individuality as a person. He was only a butterfly. Suddenly, he awoke and found himself laying there, a person once again. But then he thought to himself, ""Was I before a man who dreamt about being a butterfly, or am I now a butterfly who dreams about being a man?""",0
"The last I checked this movie was the 13th highest rated on IMDB. It is held in high regard by many critics and was even nominated for Best Picture. Combined, this makes Inception probably the most overrated film of all time.If there's one redeeming feature for this movie it is definetly the cast. Featuring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger and many others even Sir Michael Caine.Inception has a cast that gives you high hopes but unfornutaley, it fails to deliver.Inception's overcomplicated plot eclipses those of films such as The Lady From Shanghai, The Big Sleep, and even Nolan's own Interstellar.
Inception chooses to disregard all known logic for an absurd, confusing, and ridiculous plot. There is no part of this film that even remotely resembles real life-which can lead to problems including but not limited to: bordem,irritation,and utter bewilderment.Of course merely baffling us with a muddled and indiscipherable plot isn't enough.Christopher Nolan tests the limits of human intelect inundating us with farcial CGI action sequences and set pieces.The film is also riddled with mediocre bordering bad dialog and directing from this era's finest auteur. For those who despise logic, love nonsense and don't care about quality filmmaking-Inception is the film for you. Otherwise, stay away.",0
"This movie should have been right up my street.
This is modern film making, lets rush through the story with no real substance or character development, such a waste.
I use this and Lucy with the exact same problems ,when having a rant about how terrible movies/tv are getting",0
"First time I saw this movie, I was impressed by the special effects, but hardly understood the plot, thinking it was because I had missed the first half hour.
So when I got the chance to see it a second time, I payed close attention, hoping to finally understand it. I was VERY disappointed though: after 20 minutes I had seen about 4 or 5 different storylines, which were'nt even connected to the storylines, I had seen the last time (!).
So, I just switched the channel to be able to see something interesting instead: much better!",0
"Really awful, slow moving movie, so similar to Shitter Islamd with various scenes, such as small kids, wife, country house. A very long film that spends far too long on particular scenes, which really lost my interest as well as the plot being a very boring one. Don't waste your time with this one, it should not be as highly ranked as it is, a case of following the crowd it seems.",0
"After finishing Satoshi Kon's, ""Paprika"", I thought I would give a look see at a film that was inspired by Paprika that I have heard from many people as being amazing...but to me, it was just a massive disappointment. I can try and not compare the two films, but that would be rather impossible given they both use the same ingredients, but have completely different recipes to making their films.First thing I notice about the film are the characters. The actors are great, but the characters they are given are just bland and uninteresting. Having bad characters is worse than having a bad plot to me. They were very one-dimensional and felt rather emotionless. Paprika's character felt more human and were very easy to understand and/or feel for. Dom Cobb was a character I couldn't possibly care for in this regard.Next is the plot. While both films took completely different directions of the same concept, Inception felt incredibly convoluted and far-fetched to take any of it seriously. The ""M. Night"" twist at the end also never helped with the ending. While Paprika also felt convoluted in certain scenes, such as the end, it was very forgiving because of the direction. Paprika used a more surreal approach to dreams that made it rather fun and engaging to observe. Inception was rather stiff and took itself too seriously, making the convoluted aspects all the more jarring.Lastly are the presentation of the dream world. Inception had a dream world that was incredibly unimaginative and felt very flat and boring. The dream world in Paprika takes the cake for clearly being more bizarre and overall lacking any cohesion, similar to our own dreams...being extremely chaotic, nonsensical, and just surreal, altogether. Overall, Paprika's focus on the more bizarre elements of dreams and the humanization of characters portrayed the theme of their respective movie better as the plot didn't interfere with the tone of the movie, which wasn't made to be too serious. While Inception is by no means a terrible movie, it is just grossly overrated for trying to be ""smart"", ""serious"", and ""thought provoking"", though ends up being pretentious and shallow.This was a film that screamed, ""Hey look, we are so smart and philosophical, we are the best movie of the decade.""",0
"Overblown and vacuous, Christopher Nolan's Inception is a visual treat that could've easily been his magnum opus, but it ends up spending way too much time in its own set of rules that it becomes a slave to it. It essentially follows a thief (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), who steals corporate secrets in dream-sharing technology. Over the course of time, he finds out that he can return home to his family once he does the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a CEO. In this world, dreams, memories, and pseudo-science collide as an action set piece designed to impress with its visuals and complexity, but gets lost in swollen complication that the result is a bloated watch of exposition and rather forced drama.I'll start with the good_well, maybe the only great thing about this film. The visuals are spectacular. It rightfully deserves its Oscar win for it. The film is a series of ""OMG"" moments that has the viewer effectively wondering how it's done with absorbing appreciation that is matched with a fantastic central score. In spite of that, this is where a personal problem emerges. I don't think Inception does a good job of representing the dream world. Yes, looking at worlds converge with one another looks cool, but it could've been more imaginative with its dreams. Dreams are a series of thoughts and visions that happen within sleep, and I thought that Inception was too literal in representing its dreams. The landscape, the tone, and the characters feel absolutely the same as with reality_the stunning and twisting visuals being the only attribute that separates it from the real world. There is no mystical manifestation of the subconscious, no difference between dream levels. Dreams can resonate in the same manner as with reality only if there is something a bit off about it. Take Lynch's films for example (like Mulholland Drive), his dreams are like reality, but there is a different tone to it. The key is off. Not everything feels right; it may either be too perfect like an euphoric fantasy or not like a sublime nightmare. Inception is not that. To add, when the film is stripped to its barest core, it is actually just a corporate espionage film masquerading as a complex facade of dream traveling.Inception is a procedural. Nolan created a potentially intriguing world that works by its own set of rules, its own mechanics, and I admire him for that. There is a potential of exploring the ideas of dreams within dreams. It never gets past that potential, though. This film presents a world in which the characters just explain the mechanics to the viewer without doing much about its possibly interesting ideas. Once you get a really cool toy/gadget, you know one of those long manuals included in the box that you don't really read? Inception is clearly that. It could've been the awesome toy, though what we got was the manual: an overly long, two-and-a-half hour explanation on Nolan's world that never really gets anywhere. It's easy to lose interest after an hour. Nolan could've given the basics within the first 15-20 minutes and worked its way through its fascinating ideas, but the entire movie is the first 15-20 minutes. If the movie wanted to be exactly like that, then it could've been more sophisticated rather than explaining everything to the viewer with its bloated dialogue. It could've used visuals as a way of explanation_portals for changing dreams, visible contraptions for mobility, or a fantastical world where fantasy bleeds into reality, but the film's manner of ""telling over showing"" felt pseudo-intellectual and, after some time, uninteresting.The film is mostly about DiCaprio's character seeking his way to go back to his family with the job of Inception_implanting ideas in other people's heads through dreaming. The thing is, every other character felt underdeveloped. They all felt like narrative tools that spew out dialogue only to put more exposition in this supposedly complex world. Joseph Gordon Levitt's character felt wasted, his deadpan personality serving as a plate to merely just explain the procedurals of deception/inception. Ellen Page could've been more interesting, but she just felt like a door that opens to DiCaprio's backstory with Cotillard's character. With a film focusing mostly on the protagonist getting on his way home, his separate narrative didn't feel all that compelling as the film is exceedingly bland. Once it gets to the action and chase scenes, I never really cared for any of it as the film didn't do a good job of characterizing its huge cast.Inception could've been great, but it falls in love too much with its ideas and ended up spelling everything out for the viewer. Once it does that, it is actually just an action espionage thriller with very hollow characters and hours of exposition, nothing much more. It certainly gets its gimmick from the ""dream within a dream"" sequencing, but it honestly feels smarter than it actually is. In all, this film had a great idea but ran it over the ground. It is a heist movie that has nothing more on its mind than its rules and mechanics; it's convoluted and self-indulgent. Save for the gimmicks of technical achievement and landscapes collapsing unto itself, the film is rather insipid. I did like the ambiguity, but in the end this is just a superficial illusion of fantasy vs. reality; the rest is a visual pastiche.",0
"This movie talks a lot about dreams, but I doubt the goal was to make the viewer fall asleep, which happened in my case. Obviously, I din't get to finish it, which explains the lowest possible rating - as the movie that can't entartain me the least, can't get a positive review either. Maybe I'm watching it wrong? Maybe it's an experiment type of a work, something like Madame Bovary - the author tries to convince us that the style is more important than the theme... ...and ""dream theme"" sure is boring......while the style's......nothing special.",0
"I don't get it, I have read a lot of the reviews at the top of the list and I am starting to think I saw a worse movie than everyone else in a dream?!?!The plot I saw was weak with a lot of misdirection to make the movie seem more intelligent then it really was. Don't get me wrong, the special effects were awesome but to me the plot was misleading and thin at best. A dream, in a dream, in a dream? Yes it is as stupid as it sounds! For me it takes a lot more then special effects to make a movie! I just wish people were a little more honest when they were reviewing this movie. Maybe people who didn't really actually understand the movie rated it higher so they would feel smarter and better about themselves? Not the worst movie I have ever seen but definitely not a 9+ rating!It's anybody's guess.",0
"Oh, I Got It Alright. Here It Is, The Whole Thing... A pretty unimaginative and stressed-out white-collar white guy (maybe an architect, maybe a movie-maker) sits down in his big first-class seat on an airplane for a 10-hour flight home to L.A. from Sydney, takes a look around at the other rich passengers while he has some drinks and an Ambien or two, then falls asleep and has a LONG boring pointless dream with all them showing up in it, Wizard of Oz-style. Except Dorothy's Dustbowl Kansas Hillbillies were FAR more interesting than the buttoned-up executive types you find flying first-class these days.Yes, every now and then (meaning all the time these days), a movie comes along that gets so much praise from a whole lot of people. And when you do see it, you realize... We are most definitely growing dumber as a human race.This movie reminds me of a quote I read once about George W. Bush that went something like ""He's not an idiot, but he's one of those people who makes idiots feel smart because they relate to him."" Yeah, this thing's not the worst, but what a WASTE. Such a waste of technical talent. SUCH a horrible waste of great actors. (Seriously, Nardo and The Hardy together on screen for the first time, and THIS is what you have them do?!? PLEASE.) I wish Edith Piaf would've bludgeoned them all to death with a microphone-stand in the first ten minutes (Juno first please), and spent the rest of the screen-time dreaming about sex, drugs, and French jazz. And not explaining it the whole time.",0
"Putting aside the fact C Nolan is not one of my favourite directors (far from it) I was quite excited to see this title; with its strong cast and amazing SFX. However after 2 hours I was struggling to keep my eyes open and I found myself thinking; wow Mr Nolan has done it again. He's made a film thats far to long, pretentious, dumb and take itself too seriously. Obviously lots of other people won't agree with this statement and I have no gripes with your opinions, but for me I got zero entertainment due to 3 reasons:1- Though I didn't mind the plot concept, I though the execution of it was poor. Just like TV series Lost; where after a while you felt that there was no plot direction so the writers just added twists and 'made up' concepts to create a solution for the immediate plot obstacle or inject some life to the story. The kicks, dream in a dream, time slows down by half. 2 - Are you a tourist in a foreign country, no? I noticed that a lot of people comments that they found the film confusing/intellectually challenging, but I realised early in the film (and maybe for my own misfortune) that if you slowed the dialogue down; you would notice that the plot is very simple and actually quite dull. What Nolan did was treat you like a tourist in a foreign country where you can kind of understand the language but due how fast everyone talks; you cant quite grasp what people are saying and adds to the issues created in point 1. 3 - Its all based in someone subconsciousness, therefore no one is in any danger so where is the real excitement??!?!?!?!?!?!?!? 3/10Its boring, stupid concept and makes you feel stupid for no reason through directing arrogance.",0
"What a hot mess from The opening bell. How this got such hi ratings is a complete mystery. From the first minute you are shrouded in complete confusion. I watched it twice just to make sure I didn't miss something. Nope didn't miss anything except a decent movie. Graphics were good but the story is all over the place. If confusion is what you want,this is perfect for you. 2.5 hours of utter jibber jabber.",0
"Its all a dream. How do you know its a dream? Because it got a 9.4 rating. I'm waiting for a train. Its bringing a real rating of a 4. But the train doesn't come. This is not my dream. Omg. I'm going to wake up, and the real rating will be a 4, like reality. Reality as it should be, if movies were properly rated. But there's an explosion. The movie is still rated a 9.4. If I jump, maybe out of a window and die in my dream, which is someone else's dream, I might wake up to get the real rating of this movie, a 4. The van falls, I'm drowning. Finally after a long long long time, I wake up. Thank god it was all a dream. I check the rating at IMDb. OMG NO! I must still be in someone else's dream.As the big blockbuster movies become more awful, their rating consistently get higher. Any time I see a high rated (7+) new movie on a major rating website I become suspicious now. Too many times I've wasted money on crap movies because the rating said it was good. I guess they decided to push it to the limits of a 10 this time to really fool people like me that are becoming wary.The movie deserves about a 4 out of 10. The 4 is given for the nice colors and pretty good graphics. However, the plot is weak, the characters are weak, its not thought provoking or intellectual. There's no brilliant script or any new directional style here. And it feels longer than a run on sentence.Long. Boring. Jumbled. Good concept and stars wasted on this movie. See it if you have to, but don't spend money on it. Every time we spend money to see bad movies it sends a message that we are willing to accept less, and pay more. Your money is your real vote. Only vote for what is good.",0
"the thing which annoyed me most about this film is that it's taken as ""clever"" as some great philosophy which can make people think, as in ""wow mind blowing a dream within a dream within a dream wow!"" and also focuses a bit on lucid dreaming (being aware that you are asleep and able to control your dreams). However I found it annoying throughout the entire film that the ideas behind the film are fundamentally immensely incorrect.This was the same problem in the film the Matrix, the idea that the unconscious mind is a part of ""us"" and we can tap into it to control our world. It isn't a part of the individual ""us"", certainly not one which we have power over. We are our conscious selves, we're influenced by the unconsciousness, but we do not define ourselves by our unconsciousness and can't control it, we simply define ourselves as our conscious selves, our conscious thoughts, our sub-conscious influences our conscious mind. We can attempt to influence our sub-conscious with what we expose our consciousness to, but all of the general philosophy is incorrect in kind of egotistically assuming that ""we"" are the entirety of our minds including all unconscious aspects. This is the reason why the spoon bending in the matrix cant work in real life, even though many of the concepts of the matrix are correct, for example the idea that our consciousness is living in a world which is created sub-consciously, but we can't consciously manipulate this projected world and bend a spoon in half just for realising this, because it's not a projection of the consciousness but of the sub-conscious, so to try to consciously bend the spoon is out of our control, showing that the sub-conscious projection has superiority over the consciousness, in reality the consciousness can't demand the sub-conscious to change this projection no matter how hard we try. This is a major flaw in a lot of philosophical buddhist existentialism I have encountered. The inability to realise the humbling idea that we are symbiotic life forms, both physically and mentally, and that we consciously are not entirely in control but a fragment of the entirety.The same error occurs in Inception, the film mentions the unconscious mind frequently, it constantly presents the idea that every aspect of the mind entirely belongs to ourselves (in other words all belongs to the conscious part of the mind), rather than the correct idea that our minds are actually in many different parts, sub-conscious is perhaps a huge generalisation (it actually covers every aspect of the mind which is not our conscious mind we're aware of and have direct control over) and some sub-conscious parts are actually superior over the conscious (in other words superior over ""us""). We, consciously, are not completely in power, but there is a higher subconscious mind if you like which dictates our thoughts and which we don't have control over, we are in essence a slave to this. Something the Matrix almost got spot on but got wrong in parts where it showed that you can consciously break out of this mental prison. Something which Inception also got wrong in how it talked about subconsciousness.And in fact when lucid dreaming you are NOT unconscious, you are in a state of consciousness whilst still asleep, aware that any crossover between your thoughts running wild and being able to think consciously doesn't strictly make sense. You are able to sleep in a state of semi-consciousness, conscious enough to be able to focus on any aspect of the dream to change it how you like. I did not find this film to be smart, it did not make me think (more than oh it made the same kind of mistake as the matrix philosophy which I'd already previously thought about), did not awe me with philosophy, but it just annoyed me with how juvenile the films take on unconsciousness is and how incorrect I think it is. It probably could have been so much more and explored ideas that could have stunned me, but it fell completely flat. Even in the DVD extras some professor of dreams? Or something, talks about this, and this person too annoyed me with what they said because I think they just don't get it, don't get what subconsciousness and consciousness really is.That is my take on it, I might sound crazy but, I disagree strongly with any of the fundamental ideas behind the films interpretation of what unconsciousness actually is, every time ""unconsciousness"" or the ""subconscious mind"" was mentioned it annoyed me because I disagreed with what was being said, I did not at all find it a clever film with clever concepts and fresh philosophical ideas.",0
"""Inception"" is for sure, an extremely original movie with a very professional cast and a wonderful photography direction. The background sound is phenomenon, it helps the suspense and the pacing of the movie. But what's the matter of all these things, when the film is extremely uninteresting and confusing? Christopher Nolan has this problem. I can easily compare this one to ""Memento"". Both have the same good things, but fill me with boredom and lack of interest, so I wasn't able to watch either films to the end. Maybe Nolan should let someone write his movies and he only directs; that would make them much better. Do not even consider seeing ""Inception"" if you didn't like ""Memento"", period.",0
"When I first heard of this movie I could not wait to see it. I heard nothing but good reviews and it had Leo dicaprio which im am a huge fan. It was directed by christoper nolan the man who brought us the dark knight (another one of my favorites) so I watched this with very high expectations and sadly they were not met.This movie is set in the near future where it is actullay possible to enter someones mind and memories through their dreams. So a dream thief (leonardo)is sent into a persons mind to achieve ""inception""Now everybody is going to hate me for this but I thought this movie was just silly. The way they explained it and the explanations they had for everything were convoluted and silly. Then it had about hour of story and then about a hour and a half of shooting guns. You would think a movie with this complicated of story line would describe the story in depth but no. It piles on the information one thing after another in a ridiculous manner. If you liked the matrix and are usually a fan of this kind of Sci-Fi thing then this movie is most likely for you. If you are like me and prefer a movie to have solid story development and you want it to make total sense please stay away from this. The only reason i gave it 6 was because it was high budget it had leo and also some pretty stunning moments.",0
"Apologies if i stand whilst i speak of the Great Nolan, the altar is full of knick-knacks, the floor is dusty.I am sure to feel different when i have viewed this spectacle for the third time. As it is i felt no emotional engagement, no desire, no trepidation given that all threats on view were 'contrived' to be dangerous and were not inherently forceful enough to ensure my adrenalin peaked at any point by natural causes.In short, aside from my vague emotional criticism of something 'confined' by intellectual scripting, the whole does not carry the impact of the individual moment. The sensation was of having watched a two hour twenty minute trailer for a film.Clever, hence the 4 out of 10 marks. Lacking any sense of humour, warmth or human flaw, the sheer contrivance makes me want to go back to watching Batman kicking people about the place.Full of sound & no Freudian slippage, signifying misconstrued Jungian.And i apologise for the pretensions, unlike this movie, sorry, film.",0
"Noway deserves 9/10. The film has left too many things to ones imagination. The Plot could have been better. Could not understand the End. May be need to watch again to fully understand the movie. Not a must watch movie, can't be in TOP 250 Movies list. It will make you feel like scrambled egg. can give at most 5 for Picturization and Acting. Don't Expect much and you will still be better than watching with high entertainment expectation. I would rate King of Persia/StarTrek/Sherlock Holmes/Salt/Ramona and Beazus/UP/Matrix in recent Movies 8* compared to this.There must be panel of people asked to rate it hight to make it 9*. So don't get in Hurry to watch this movie. You can have better options.",0
"Films are fictions of a director, based on a story. The story may be an existing story (a book, a true story) or pure fantasy; a film should always have a meaning, worth watching and must relate to the logic, to the reasoning of the viewers. To make films more interesting and challenging for the experienced viewer, directors may use different techniques like reversing or mixing the chronological sequence of scenes and temporarily confusing the viewer with dream scenes. These techniques should not be used just to make the movie more 'difficult' or more 'intellectual'; they should add an artistic value to the story. If you'd take away these 'tricks', you should still have left a solid story. 'Inception' is a bit different in the sense that the dream technique is maybe more important than the story. Maybe it is the story. Here the dreams are deliberately directionally started by an obscure apparatus in a suitcase and some wires, dreams that function on different levels or layers, each with some logical, preponderant illogical characteristics, but all very realistic, confusing dreams and reality; not only for the viewer, but also for the characters. That's the good part. The bad part is that the logic of the story is completely lost. We are watching a pudding of in itself highly attractive action scenes on different dream levels, in strange ways interacting with themselves. The actions are the results of what the principle characters dream up, we guess. Then why so much fuzz, so much bustle, and why not dream up a less complicated and less violent way to find your wife and children, which are dead, alive or only exist in you dreams? Dreams are uncontrollable, you might say. That is true, but the essence of this movie is, that the dreams in this movie are controllable. That is why this movie is not honest and does not touch your feelings. It is just a sequence of impressive actions, served with an intellectual intended sauce of dream states which after some researching do not make a lot of sense. My idea is that the high reviews on the IMDb-site have to do with viewers that are accustomed to video games, which use these concepts of complicated means of finding the solution or goal. For them it is all about the game, not about logic, reasoning and films that move you.",0
"The trailers of this movie were great, especially the second one (look for it on youtube). Great, dark score, mysterious story, superb special effects, and two great actors.The problem with the movie is, the trailer lasts little longer than 2 minutes, the movie lasts over two hours, and the time is wasted -- there is no mystery here. All good parts are in trailer already, the movie adds only ""surprising"" twists, but they are not surprising, they are just like deus ex machina alterations. The characters could even speak foreign language, it wouldn't matter because there is no cause-effect chain here, most events are incoherent.The movie repeats itself (how this can be interesting?), the moral struggles of the characters are rather shallow and predictable, and with constant shifts (now let's try something completely different) it is so unreal (not in sci-fi sense) that I didn't even care. Sure, unreality works for Terry Gilliam because he uses tale scheme, it worked for The Matrix because it was futuristic message with ancient background, it worked for Monty Python because it was comedy. But here? What it is? Monty Python seriously?Speaking of The Matrix, it was 11 years ago, when my mind was simply blown away. Inception didn't even manage to get me interested. You want a fast paced action thriller, watch The Kingdom (2007), want a masterpiece of suspense you cannot wait for solution, see The Ghost Writer (2010), you want an insight of the mind, see The Matrix, again (1999).Inception just will make you yawn. It is not even the execution, there was not any good idea for a full feature movie in the first place. The Matrix succeeded because it explained the whole mechanism and all pieces of the puzzle fit. Trailer of the Inception explains the mechanism well enough, there is nothing left to explain in the movie (and additionally, because of the nature of those two movies, there had to be a lot of similarities, and there are).I rate it so high (4/10) because I like main actors (yes, Ellen Page is cute). Every movie rating is a matter of taste but anyway I am totally surprised Inception is #3 at the charts, my advice -- look for something maybe not that fresh, but really solid, the one I mentioned above or Nothing but the Truth, or Syriana, or Body Lies, or The Departed, or (if you prefer something lighter, for summer), The Shooter, or... ;-D",0
"Wow, what a bad movie. I was truly surprised at how bad it was. It was an interesting concept but just evolved into a plethora of violence, noise, and special effects. I am a Leanardo Decaprio fan and have been impressed with his acting since What's Eating Gilbert Grape? (1993) but there was very little acting in this movie, note: no Oscar nominations for acting in any category. I can't understand how it was nominated for Best Picture, other than the fact the needed to fill up the new number of 10 nominees needed. Note, no nomination for Best Director. I thought Ellen Page was hugely miscast; she was a distraction through-out the movie. There were only 2 or 3 brief scenes when there was a bit of meaningful dialogue. There was the potential to develop Cobb's relationship with Saito, but it never happened. If you are expecting a movie with good acting, good direction, and any depth, do not go to see Inception. You will be disappointed.",0
"I know Nolan is a director, not a scientist.However, as a person who relies on logic and reason to understand the world, I need at least some plausibility with my science fiction films in order to immerse myself into the experience.I've had lucid dreams before, at least I think I have. I remember that I've done things in dreams to try to discern if I am indeed dreaming, but I don't necessarily remember how I existed as a conscious entity in those dreams. I might have sort of been just a third person omniscent, invisible ""thing"" floating around observing myself walking around. I think I may have fluctuated between first person and third person consciousness, where I would somehow start distorting everything around ""me"" once the idea occurred that I may not be in reality. Then, when everything becomes a huge, entropic mess, I would wake up. Of course this experience may be unique to me, but it seems that the fluid nature of dreams lends itself to something much more complex than a simple duplication of reality from a person's awake state. Nolan completely ignored this aspect, and I feel it detracted from the overall strength of the film.Furthermore, I don't even remember why I tried to figure out I was in a dream, and I also don't remember recalling the need to question if things make sense from a Newtonian physics standpoint. Newtonian physics is undoubtedly ""intuitive"", but because consciousness itself is such an opaque field, I don't see why something such as a spinning top would convince any reasonable person that they are dreaming or in ""reality"". How could Cobb be certain the top was accurately representing reality or a dream anyway, since it is nothing but his projection of what he thinks will happen in his dream. That is, how could the top transcend the laws of the new world created by the architect, and behave strictly by Cobb's current, conscious interpretation? Also, the transplantation of consciousness from an awake state to a dream state is also independent of a transplantation of memories. It seems to me that Nolan practically invoked the transmission of ""souls"" into the movie, and may have in the process confused the concepts of souls and consciousness.It seems like these characters completely neglected what it means to actually dream and what it means to live in a dream-like world. Sure, perhaps this is not relevant to the movie itself, but in addition to other disappointments such as static characters and shallow dialogue, I can say that it kind of turned me off to the film's main grab: its philosophical implications (which, granted, may not be too deep anyway, considering the crux of the whole film just seems to be that there is no way to distinguish what is ""real"" and what isn't. Essentially, the age-old the whole perception vs. reality argument).Overall, better than anything this year, but it falls short.",0
"Clumsy, derivative, lazily scripted and massively over-long. I know this isn't what most people are saying about Inception but I'm afraid this is the cruel truth about the film. There is simply nothing new here, despite the ""originality"" everyone has credited the film with. If you've seen The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Blade Runner, or Johnny Mnemonic (to name but a few) then there is going to be little here to surprise you. The opening half hour of the film spends its time frantically throwing complex and very clunky exposition at you in a desperate attempt to explain the highly contrived rules of the dreamworlds which provide the backdrop for much of the narrative. The action is there, but as always, Nolan struggles to film it in an exciting way, generally pushing the camera so close to his subject that it is impossible to really make out what is going on. Even the dream worlds in the film are remarkably bland and unimaginative - apparently we all dream as if we are in a Hollywood high-concept film dominated by CGI. The small scale nature of most dreams is nowhere to be found here and nor is any of the fascinating strangeness and mystery associated with dreaming; apparently the subconscious only really expresses itself in our dreams by manifesting itself as a lot of rather tetchy people who try to beat up anyone who invades the dreamer's mind (sound at all like the agents in The Matrix?). There are of course some impressive visual effects along the way (for instance at one point Paris suddenly folds back on itself so that streets run vertically and upside down like something from an M C Escher picture) but these are calculated simply for spectacle and Nolan really misses a trick in picking up the potentially genuinely fascinating subject of dreams and the way in which they link to the fantasy world of films. I'm sure this will be popular with a lot of teenage boys who might be impressed with the cod-philosophy of the film, but if you've seen any of the films listed in the first few lines of this review or if you've read novels by Philip K Dick or William Gibson, you aren't going to find much to engage with here. Massively over-rated, incredibly tedious and a waste of an excellent cast who, in fairness, do the best they can with the dreadful screenplay they were handed.",0
"After a June filled with movies that wanted to be nothing but popcorn fun but ultimately your popcorn bucket emptied, we were all looking forward to Inception bringing something intelligent to the screen. Man, what a huge let down. I guess you can't blame Inception for expectations and for the crap that came before it but those factors may have led to the disappointment. People labeling this film as smart are doing nothing but exposing their own ignorance. Either that or else, they're exposing their own vast imagination because they must have filled in scenes in their own head to compensate for this films obvious shortcomings. There was no thought put into the dialogue and the effects are certainly awful. The action scenes are weak simply because they scream cartoon. I know they have the ""Matrix excuse"" that lets them warp reality but the CG is too bizarre for my taste. The shocking thing is that most of entire movie lacks real energy and especially lacks heart. Anyone else think there was little chemistry between the stars? Everyone besides Leo seemed to intentionally deliver no personality or charisma. I knew Nolan was going for an Indy-bizarre flavor. So, I expected little character development but I did expect to care about something or someone in the film. That really never happens. What a shame.Can filmgoers want to love a film so much that they block out how bad the film turned out? Or, will they be jaded holding it up to impossible expectations? Maybe my expectations were too high but I was greatly disappointed by this movie. The writers of this film and YES, the director took a promising concept and turned it in to a blathering waste of effort. Hope can be a strong thing but hoping so hard that you'll love a film that you actually fool yourself in to believing its good is genuinely unhealthy.",0
"I suspected that the rave reviews for this movie came from mostly teenage/young boys, and that seems to be the case based on the polls. In fact, this movie is essentially impossible to follow, and worst of all, you won't care about a single character in it--not really, anyway. There is no drama, there are simply empty characters mouthing nonsense about dreams and dreams within dreams. It steals from the Matrix and other movies, and does a far worse job with similar material than those better movies did.Perhaps the first full hour or more is little more than chat that is full of hot air and psychobabble but that probably a lot of people in the audience don't bother thinking about. Everyone's waiting for the special effects, which do come along, but when they do, you probably won't care what happens or for that matter, even know what is happening. Vans falling from bridges, a snow fortress under attack--why? What? No matter. You'll be led to believe this all Means Something, but it doesn't, and worse, you'll feel nothing too.",0
"I went to watch it last night at a local Kino in Berlin motivated by the high rating this movie has in this same website. I was actually expecting something good, we were talking about Blade Runner (our benchmark) before watching it, dreaming it could get anywhere close to it. We were wrong The first 20 minutes of the film were OK, but after that the film revealed itself to be no more than a fast paced video-clip action film. The script is OK but has quite many flaws, the dialogs are so bad most of the time. It's like everything is not natural and the characters are forced to explain things and as we say in Spanish they use a shoehorn so the audience doesn't get lost I suppose. Nevertheless what they do is not that hard to understand and they could have simply done it in a way more clever way. The acting is extremely weak, if you are looking for the di Caprio from the aviator, departed, so on, forget about this film. I guess Leonardo did what he could with this piece of crap script they gave him. If this wasn't enough, the film has music playing behind almost the entire film, very common among the sci-fi action films of our time, maybe it's me, but I cannot stand techno music or whatever during the entire film. I guess you know what I mean. And last, the action, it has more action than needed. the last 45 minutes I was literally yawning and wouldn't have minded to leave the cinema. It was awful, gunshots, grenades, kicks and punches.... simply pathetic. Im sorry for Nolan, he made memento which is a great film and Dark Knight was also good, but this?¿ this is crap and if you like sci- fi and quality, waiting for a DVD release should be enough. What Im afraid is that all those 10 rating votes are from young people or something, who haven't seen much sci-fi or just think this is what sci-fi is supposed to be, nothing more distant from reality.",0
"For an original screenplay it conjures up dreams of other movies. It starts with Ken Watananbe looking like Dustin Hoffman in ""Little Big Man"". It contains the assault on Blofeld's headquarters from ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Edith Piaf sings to remind us of Marion Cotillard's Oscar win for ""La Vie en Rose"", before Cotillard turns into Norman Bates' ""Psycho"" mother.Ellen Page seemed too young and mumbled her lines. Michael Caine was a distraction in a tea bag role, dipping in here and there. Hans Zimmer wrote a head pounding score that no one could sleep through. Given a ten hour flight to plant the idea in the subjects mind, it seemed like it took ten hours. The burning question of Leo getting home pales to ""are we ever getting out of the theater"". The movie suffers from the written, produced and directed by syndrome. It is way too long, way to loud and way too bad.",0
"If you didn't like The Matrix movies, here's more of the same. Movies involving dreams and alternate realities basically set up a world where anything can happen and there are no rules.I LIKE rules. If there were rules here, they were very hard to follow and very shortly into the movie, I just didn't care.Leo's character claims to be the greatest person in the world at delving into people's minds. Then why is he so consistently incompetent at it? His dead wife keeps popping up when she's least welcome, nothing ever goes to plan. The whole plan benefits only Leo, puts everyone else in jeopardy and is built on very shaky ground. Saito says he will fix Leo's problems with one phone call and he's immediately on board? Speaking of the plan, why does implanting a fairly simple idea into another person's head involve blowing everything up in sight? I didn't care about his dead wife. Was she actually dead or did she just die in a dream and is stuck in limbo? I wish *I* was stuck in limbo so I didn't have to think about this movie anymore.Some notes about the actors: I could rarely understand what Ken Watanabe was saying. Ellen Page still looks like she's ten years old and I just didn't accept her in this role. The other guys were okay but I just wasn't invested into anything they were saying or doing.As it has been noted in other reviews, what do I care if this guy Fischer's company is bigger than Saito's or not? ""Let's go through all of this convoluted nonsense because in the future, something bad MIGHT happen?"" There's one method of getting him to break up his company that could have been tried and wasn't: Walk up to him and ask him to break up his company. He didn't seem all that ambitious, he didn't seem to care about his father's company. It would have been worth a shot.Part of me kept hoping the plane would crash and it would end the necessity of all this.It's too bad that in a reality where anything can happen, Nolan creates a world where nothing of consequence happens.",0
"i will start off by saying that I'm not a fan of DiCaprio's work,but that is not the reason why i didn't like this movie.the special effects are spot on but i just didn't like the idea of the script, the acting was almost lazy and forced,it seems to me that maybe DiCaprio is getting worse with age (much like brad Pitt).of course when i viewed this with a few mates they all loved it but i was left with a headache.the script was all over the place and it was a little too confusing and hard to keep track of. this was named as one of the best movies of 2010 but i saw way better animated movie that year. do yourself a favour and save your money and time.",0
"Epic Fail.People are to plug in a cable to some black box, close their eyes and become visitors in other's heads? Come on - thats way too simple and too far away, if not absolutely impossible anywhere in our universe, and never will.Given that, it's nearly impossible for me to get a grip into that film. Too unrealistic. One's think all the time is ""that cannot be"".""So is fiction!"" one might admit.But for me Inception lacks the ability to lead its spectator over ""that final threshold"" that lets us forget just and right that.I love C.Nolans interpretation of the Memento Mori. Kinda realistic. Thrilling. One real classic.Inception is not. Look what happened to Avatar in #Top250.",0
"I checked engraved my euro, I'm awake, it's true I'm sitting in a chair watching this movie. I'cant escape, I have to wait for the end. A good idea, fine actors, explosions, exotic locations, and special effects put them in a bag,mix them and this case you don't get a movie. There is no plot or scenario when the writers or director did get stacked, it was very easy: it's a dream. I thought the film was all about the manipulation of the brain and effect on human behavior. But after 30 minutes I was looking at ordinary action film with people shooting but not did get hurt, buildings that erased, turned or collapsed. The whole universe in this film looked like a comic book, only cardboard characters. Instead of seeing this movie, take a nap and make you own dream.",0
"I keep hoping I will wake up having seen one of the top three movies of all time, and was only dreaming of being duped once more by the payola-ridden viral-fest that the rating of entertainment on the net has become.""The Matrix"" is an example of an intelligent comic book treatment on film.""Mulholland Drive"" is an example of an intelligent film about dreams.""Inception"" is neither, but currently rated miles above both by the IMDb shills. Go figure.Besides its conceptual shortcomings,""Inception"" is just not a very good movie from a technical perspective. Overlong and overacted by the entire cast in an effort to bring some life to this ""snooze,"" even high dollar action scenes and CGI can't liven it up. No comic relief, none whatsoever, to allay the squirming in the theater seat wondering when it will ever be over.The ""love interest"" subplot is head-scratchingly extraneous to what might have been an interesting corporate espionage thriller.Leonardo D. can not carry a movie any more to save his life, in fact the entire cast is miscast. If you disagree, dream that Tim Roth or Gary Oldman was cast in the lead and tell me I'm wrong.",0
"I really wanted to like this morning but it was the first one since Mr Magoo that I have felt like walking out of! I had a feeling of having seen it all before during this movie - I was constantly thinking of Robin Williams in What Dreams May Come where his wife is trapped in purgatory and also Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. By the end we were all waiting for it to end in my group and comments when filing out of the cinema in Australia were much the same from the rest of the crowd. It actually feels like a nightmare which I guess is what the director intended. On the upside it had a fantastic all star cast but they struggled to make this mess coherent. Cillian Murphy - still waiting to hit the Hollywood big time he deserves - tried his best with his limited script but he really needs a better part than this. The music was quite jarring all the way through, and sounds near identical to DiCaprio's last movie; the much better Shutter Island. The constant strings with trumpet bellows are meant to add tension, but after you hear the same sequence of music for over two hours it gets a little annoying to say the least. I am sorry; I wanted to love it but it ended up being baffling by the plot and painfully boring to watch.",0
"OK, Inception is, in my opinion, the culmination of everything that's wrong with the movie biz these days.Awful dialog and no characterization, stock actors who give stock performances, plot holes that are covered by the a fore mentioned awful dialog and weak characterization, an inability to explain much of the way the dream world and limbo work, and the ambiguity of the entire movie is quite over the top. If something isn't done soon, movies like Inception will be considered great works of film when the people who work on them don't even take the time to have a coherent storyline.",0
"MANY SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!One of the main problems with this movie is that it explicates certain directives important to planting ideas and then the movie doesn't follow them. In one scene, Gordon-Levitt is shooting at some bad guys, then Hardy comes over and says, ""Dream bigger,"" and pulls out a grenade launcher. This, coupled with Page's manipulation of the dream early on, seems to indicate that there is power to change what is in the dream. Yet when the van is under attack, the driver only has a crappy pistol. Seriously? What about the directive that an idea has to be simple enough to seem that it springs from the subject's own mind, otherwise they will know its true genesis lies outside them. But the filmmakers steal from many films and don't think the audience will recognize their genesis. People have already mentioned Paprika, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and the Matrix. But there is also in the Cobb/Moll storyline a lot taken from What Dreams May Come. Plus there are Escher stairs that turn into Harry Potter stairs. Personally, even with the hours (felt like) of explication the film did, I never understood how they actually shared dreams. They get wired into a dream? I thought the tube was for what the chemist mixed. How does that allow the dream to be shared? And limbo? Seriously? What a cop out. You remove something that made sense (you die, you wake up) and turn it into ridiculousness--now you're shoved down into pure subconscious and you can't really survive there b/c your brains become scrambled. Yikes. There was plenty more that was problematic, but others here have covered or, I'm sure, will cover that, too. This movie would have been better if it hadn't tried to do so much. Again the trailers were misleading and I thought the plot was going to focus on the ins/outs of many dreams/dreamers. More than a waste of money, it was a waste of time.",0
"I don't normally write reviews but looking at the 'This is a true masterpiece' type of reviews I thought I would balance it out a bit.Inception is a good film, the special effects are simply stunning and the acting very good indeed.The plot however is quite weak, and gets a bit lost and muddled towards the end.Many people think that because the plot appears complicated you have to watch it very carefully or twice. Not true the plot is very simple, and I found the film easy to follow, in fact after the first 30 Min's, me and my mates could easily predict what would happen - and indeed it did happen.All in all a good film, its the best I have seen this year. However very predictable and not really that clever.",0
"Watching this movie was a complete waste of time. Afther watching, you realize that screenplay has (too)many faults, that directing is on high school level, and that actors are pathetic, just like director. I really don't see the reason why this movie did get such good reviews. Nolan took parts from movies like; The Cell, The Matrix, Oceans Eleven, James Bond, and the final product is a bunch of nonsense. I personally don't like Nolan's films, but with this one he's gone really too far. He got lost when he was filming, you can tell it from the beginning of the movie. It's a type of film for American audience. I hope it will fail in Europe.",0
"I found this movie to be terribly boring and kept falling asleep trying to sit through it. The premise is ridiculous on every level and they try to make it seem clever by not explaining anything.The reason trippy things happen when you dream is because the brain is operating at such a low level that simple logic and common sense are not possible. Its not possible to deal with layers of complexity of the dreams within dreams, the visual world itself is well beyond the comprehension of an unconscious brain. Quite simply if your brains awake enough to deal with this world then you are very awake.Though the stupidest part is entering other peoples dreams by lying down next to them....i found that interesting...Even the thing about the chick from Juno being the architect and she wasn't even gonna go in with them. The premise appeared one of them would control/create the world from within the dream world which was meant to be her, yet she wasn't gonna be there...Worst big budget movie I've seen although I just saw Prometheus and that was pretty bad.",0
You quickly get where the story is going with the dream in a dream idea. The storyline becomes more complex as the movie progress forward. Sadly the same cannot be said for the development of characters. The main character is the only one that is treated and the only thing we see about him is that he miss his wife and kids. This is not enough to empathize with his character.A young girl as the role of the protagonist but it's hard to identify with her character as she is annoying. The story is not engaging as we don't really care for those characters. Masturbatory special effect don't save this empty shell. All the levels of dreams were rather annoying and felt like a way to masquerade the absence interesting plot.Disappointing. Such a movie shouldn't get such a high rating on IMDb.,0
"9.1 / 10 on IMDb? So ~91% of Earth's population is asleep, these people like the film so much, because it tells them of fantahstic possibilities of dream state.Well I don't want to wake up anyone forcefully, espehcially since propagation of the weird reality of the American Dream, but speaking from an outsider's observation-point: looking at all your bodies with your eyes wide-open but frozen in deep-sleepYou all are so vulnerable in your dream!Since your birth it has been continuous, stabilized by swallowing Matrix-blue pills. Greatest drama is you will never wake up what happens at the final moment may resemble an individual in coma whose heart or brain stops.",0
"I was disappointed. I had great expectations from the film and I was let down. The story was predictable, nothing was left on viewer's imagination, the constant talking and explanation(in any single scene)was unnecessary. The techniques of direction were pioneering, but the story lacking of depth. The development of the character's personality was short, as a result the lack of connection between the movie's characters and the viewers. I expected more silent scenes and less gunfire. Nollan, this time, was arrogant,underestimating the viewer's mind. The move was like a ""blockbusterous"" imitation of memento. It was nothing new.I found myself sleeping after the break. When the movie ended ""I was old and regarded"".",0
"This is by far my most disappointing movie experience in years. Its not really that its that bad. I would probably have given it 7 stars if it wasn't for the unbelievable 9.1 average, which sent me to the theater with such high expectations.First of all, I have to get this of my chest: ITS NOT THAT ORIGINAL! In 1998 a by-now-forgotten film by the title of Dark City was released, with a strikingly similar premise, but with better writing, a tighter plot and a fraction of the budget of this monstrosity. Do yourself a favor, watch it.Back to Inception: The casting is good, the performances vary between average to good, and in general they more or less work together. But the characters lack any real depth, the dialog is mediocre and the pervasive pseudo-science conversations are down-right silly.Visually its stunning, ground-breaking, with more special effects than you could ever wish for, but quite often pointless. The same goes for the action sequences, amazing yes, but often out of place and you can't shake the feeling that they were forced into the plot: OK guys, its been three minutes since something exploded or someone used a grenade launcher, stuff an action scene in here.Worst of all: the premise of the film is ridiculous but there is nothing that makes it believable. This, I think, is the mark of a great Sci-Fi flick: you completely buy into the premise no matter how ridiculous it is. Inception fails.Does it have better entertainment value/ is it a better film than:Shutter Island: No, but comes close/ No, doesn't even come closeDistrict 9: No, D9 is 3 times more fun/ No, God No, in what dreamworld?Clash of the Titans: Yes/ YesThe A-Team: About the same/ Yes, its better than The A-TeamAvatar: No/ NoFinally, Dark City: bang-for-buck, Yes/ No, even though Dark City has a weaker cast its still the better movie,",0
"I have a pretty high standard when it comes to the re-interpretation of dreams (or the workings of the mind in general) by filmmakers which is likely due to the fact that I myself am a dreamer. There is nothing more irksome than these half-conceived, mostly contrived dalliances that are gobbled up by the ever passive viewing public as if they were shedding a bright light on the subject. I could go on about how not one of the characters is developed enough to overcome the films main flaw of not being LIKE A DREAM or how Nolan couldn't seem to make up his mind which movie to make; the more psychologically gripping tale of multiple lives lived in an endless cascade of dreams or the non-stop, high octane espionage tale which would have been super fun if it had actually taken place IN A DREAM (but keepin' it real, the action sequences we did see were pretty standard). I won't, however, because I can't let go of the glaring inadequacies of Mr. Nolan's literal, linear, unimaginative, and perhaps disinterested efforts to delve into the dream world proper.While walking out of the theater, I got into a quick chat with another member of the audience. I stated that, :in the main the film was predictable"" and he replied, ""I think it was supposed to be"". Really, since when are dreams predictable? Mein Gott! We're getting soft. People, we're not supposed to walk out of a movie concerned with this both known and unknowable subject matter rock-steady. On the contrary, we should all be wearing deeply puzzled yet deeply satisfied looks on our faces as though we'd been led across some great gulf and left there to work our own way back. The takeaway message here is that it takes more than the latest CGI to deliver a reasonable simulacrum of the sub-conscience. And for the proof of that remark one need only look at the work of Michel Gondry and of the master, David Lynch. Your mind will reel indefinitely.",0
"Oh man this film wasn't really that good and I'll try to explain why without giving anything away.Firstly let me just say that I've always been a fan of Christopher Nolan, and whilst I've never particularly been a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio his recent films particularly shutter island changed that view and I've actually started to like him he's surely grown as an actor over the years, furthermore, there are other talented cast in there but Joseph Gordon-Levitt I think was a bad choice for this movie he just didn't suit his role.OK now onto the actual film, the ideas were there, so was the budget and the cast so were did it all go so wrong? With a mixture of the directing and writing things got too deep and generally quite cryptic that felt a little hacky at times. It's not greatly structured nor does it seem well thought out, I think they tried to put so many twists and turns on the movie that it just wasn't that enjoyable; I totally understood it but the time they spent putting too many twists and turns in it could and should have been spent using deeper character development and general creativity opposed to just making things as non-linear as possible.4/10 and that's being generous",0
"---CONTAINS SPOILER---- I'll be honest. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, but it does not deserve to rank #3 on IMDb alongside masterpieces as the godfather... It's really insulting! The movie is average and unnecessarily long, as well as terribly repetitive: bum bum bang bang in Mombasa; car chases and bum bum bang bang in the rain; bum bum bang bang in a hotel, and yes of course, bum bum bang bang in the snow...!!! I could really yawn at the second bum bum bang bang...!!! It was as if the only reason Nolan created so many layers of dreams within dreams was to justify different Rambo scenarios...Therefore, any depth the movie can achieve gets lost within the dumb shootings, endless chases and meaningless explosions...And the ending is so predictable...!!! I personally prefer other Nolan films, like The Dark Knight.",0
"9.4? ? ? ? ? Wow I went and saw it tonight because of all the Hype. I decided to stay level headed because the previews did not look that great. I went into it with medium expectations, and it was still a huge let down. Honestly I would give it a 3/10 for its cinematography and effects. It lacks everything everything that makes a great or even a good movie. The characters weren't developed besides Leonardo's and they were all bland and uninteresting. There are about 4 different subplot-like events going on and it creates for the viewer to be very disconnected, you never sympathize or empathize for anyone or anything in the movie, let alone give a damn about its very uninteresting story. The story was all over the place dragged out and bland, I felt disconnected from the whole plot. Good premiss, cool idea, good graphics.... Story was border line awful, acting was just average for such good actors, the characters were bland and sucked, the dialogue got wacky and pretty out there and didn't even make sense at times. the cinematography was all over the place. These past 2 years the IMDb rating has been corrupted or screwed. This is not, not, not a great or even a good movie. One of my least favorite Decaprio and Nolans films. The Dark Knight must have got to his head. Could we see another lost director like Tarentino? Apparently not to general audience who are apparently mindlessly entertained and think everything that is confusing is wonderful.",0
"Imagine a world where dreams could be tamed, where they could shared ... where they could be tapped into by others with ulterior motives. Imagine being unable to tell whether you were indeed dreaming or not, being unable to tell if those you were interacting with were merely projections of your subconscious, or enemies from the outside trying to discover your inner-most secrets ... or trying to implant ideas into that subconscious ...Feeling a little warped? Well, that's how I felt about five minutes into this mind-bender starring Leonardo DiCaprio, a movie described by The Rolling Stone as ""James Bond Meets 'The Matrix,'"" and after watching the highly-stylized trailers for this movie by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight""), that's exactly what I expected. And while I'm not one of those idiotic fans who actually believe that actors invent the movie, I was encouraged by Leo's earlier venture this year into movies with more existential themes, ""Shutter Island,"" - an interesting, mildly surprising movie whose twist borrowed heavily from Alejandro Amenábar's ""The Others."" Existential movies, along with the upcoming ""The Adjustment Team"" starring Matt Damon, have piqued my interest with the notion that Hollywood is once again revisiting a genre seemingly forgotten since the turn of the Millennium. ""The Matrix,"" ""Fight Club,"" ""Waking Life,"" ""eXistenZ,"" ""The Thirteenth Floor,"" ""Sixth Sense,"" ""Abre los Ojos / Vanilla Sky"" and ""The Truman Show"" seemed to be an artistic query from the creative world about the nature of our existence in a new era where concepts of religion, nationhood, and individual were starting to lose their original definitions.This year, there seemed to be a re-awakening of this collective self-examination through cinema, and while ""Shutter"" was a nice (but borrowed) first start ... ""Inception"" is a pompous goose-chase. It's premise is as mind-bending as Neo's dialed-in world, but you soon sigh with disappointment as the characters are forced to narrate its many complexities: a maze that is so convoluted, it nearly drowns in its own philosophical holes.At the final scene, you're wondering what you might have missed; the last scene mocking the mental notecard you've been keeping to keep up with the ""dreams-within-a-dream."" Its eXistenZ's-inspired plot is suddenly destroyed by a Bobby Ewing-esquire shower, and you wonder - suddenly - how long you've been duped.Existential movies are by their very nature puzzles. ""Inception"" is a very extraordinary attempt by Christopher Nolan to match the mastery of the Wachowski's brothers' masterpiece ... and it is very noble failure. While the backdrops and CGI is all at-the-ready, what lacks is a consistent vision, metaphorical references, and momentum. It pretends to be a clever ride on the roller-coaster of reality, at a pace so fast that one would almost assume that Nolan is smarter than his viewers. The end is neither satisfying nor clever, and the spinning attempt to keep the viewer pondering ... to me ... is the resignation of Nolan that his story simply ran out of steam.Here's a better idea for your fifteen dollars: put it in a garbage disposal.",0
"I must admit, we went to see this in the theater after the massive positive reviews, the high ratings on IMDb, and most of all, the promising concept of the film...Di Caprio is one of the finest actors. He's got charisma and knows what he's doing and how he's bringing it, but as a 'hero' he doesn't seem to pull it off. I just don't believe him... He's too, I don't know quite how to put it... too soft? His performance was impeccable though, but I think the director wasn't assertive enough to direct him as he should have.But then again, it's not due to Di Caprio the whole thing was full of flaws. The main thing that annoyed me most was (again) the overdue of explosions and cgi. Although high quality and nice use of it didn't add any value to the whole thing. On the contrary!!!Second, there was the inconsistency of things happening. (And not only this one, but let's leave at this) Everything was surrounded by the truck falling into the water and there is what insulted me so much. At the speed the truck was falling it should have hit the water more than five times when things were happening. Every time the scenes were cutting back to the truck they made sure he was going back up instead of going down. Friends of mine said, 'yeah, it was, but don't make such a big fuss out of it'! Well, in fact I do, because that is what was driving the sequences. What did the director think? That we have no brains? Maybe some haven't looking at the comments and ratings, but one couldn't look next to the fact that things were so bluntly thrown at us. OK, you can say 'it's all a dream isn't it?, but still...And what was it near the end when Di Caprio suddenly wakes up without any explanation. Quite laughable actually because there was more then enough explaining throughout the whole movie. Now this is happening, now that. I mean, come on...Next time they should take out all the Hollywood sh ite and put some intelligent stuff in. You know, some things that makes our mind buzz.I only saw one movie once that had what it takes but was left out of the picture due to another one, the matrix. The movie I'm talking about was '13th Floor'!So, if you have the time and want a good reference to make sure what is wrong with Inception, then watch '13th Floor'!!!Since everyone is highly overrating this movie, I'm going to 'underrate' it with at least one point. It gets a 4/10, and believe me, many will say that it is still too much!So once again, rent '13th Floor' if you want something that'll make you go 'wohow'",0
"I'm not often driven to write a review but this needs to be said. Billed with rave reviews expectation was high, but this film is totally over rated, Unengaging, uninteresting & down-rite boring.. at best contrived & designed to bamboozle the General viewing demographic into believing it is an amazing masterful multi layered work of Genius, in fact its simply a long winded futile effort at re-branding the matrix concept of virtual reality.... The first hour is taken up by efforts to convince and educate the Audience at the lowest intellectual level, so anyone with half an 'o'level awaits the actual story with Grinding misery... when eventually the director feels we are up to speed what we have in store is just a jumbled overly contrived story of not particularly interesting content.. the only redeeming feature this film has to offer is a fleeting philosophical moment of ""what if...."" please take a pillow and a book if you choose to endure this films transparent 2hrs+ of flashing lights loud atmospheric musical score... I'm generally a positive glass is half full kinda Guy.. but this is definitely an empty cigarette-butt tainted post hangover stale beer bottle of a film....",0
"It should be called ""Deception"". Or ""James Bond Meets The Matrix"". Take the worst bits of James Bond and the worst bits of The Matrix movies, randomly mix them together, and you have ""Inception"".It's pretentious nonsense from start to finish. The characters are caricatures, the acting is formulaic, and the plot! Jeez. It starts badly and gets worse. By the end, even the director couldn't be bothered and lets it degenerate into a standard James Bond movie (complete with men in snow suits fighting on skis).The age rating (12A in the UK) means the ideal demographic for this movie (8 year-old boys) can't see it. This film is so bad, it creeps into classic-bad-movie territory. Oh, by the way, I ""get it"". I just don't ""like it"". And the movie is not existentialist. It's pointless.I like to say something positive about every movie I see but I am struggling with this one. Oh, I have something: it has a great ending - because it ends.",0
"I loved ""Memento""...I liked ""The Dark Knight"" and I couldn't believe that Heath Ledger could out-do Jack...I truly like every actor in ""Inception""...I am a faithful IMDb user for many years....having said all those good things, WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU VOTERS?....More than 100,000 of you voted this movie a ""10""?? You're gonna tell me that this movie is the 4th best movie of all-time?...I don't know if there's another movie website out there but I'm gonna start looking....what a joke...I don't understand what's going on with the IMDb voters lately, but if you think that Inception, The Dark Knight, City of God, The Matrix, and The Professional deserve to be in the top 35 movies of all time, it's time for me to look for another movie website...Not a single one of those movies is worth a second view (with the possible exception of the Dark Knight if only to watch Ledger), and not one of those movies will be relevant in 5 years (with the possible exception of The Matrix for its' special effects)...For a movie to be rated in the Top 250 of all-time you have to think ahead...will anyone CARE about it in 10 years time??...Who's gonna care about this movie in 2 years time? I thought Shutter Island was pretty stupid but Shutter Island is The Godfather of all movies compared to this mess of a movie...Oh, I'm wrong, It's not a dream...It's a dream within a dream...or is it a dream within a dream within a dream?",0
"I would like to warn everyone that this movie is seriously overrated. Based on the rating here I decided to see it in the cinema, I wish I hadn't. It's not entertaining and plain boring, and much too long and repetitive. The characters are boring and very plain. It's almost like watching a couple of zombies of watching paint dry. It could have easily been an hour shorter. Plot holes are all over the place, nothing is properly explained and it's nothing but philosophical mumbo jumbo. Even the action was boring and unexceptional. I wouldn't even see it again if they paid me to do so (although maybe for enough cash I would). A large part of the audience that was in the theatre with me seemed to agree, because I heard only negative reactions. I gave it a 1 because a 9 is seriously overrated.",0
"Dear Christopher, I first suspected something might be a little off when a high octane action sequence at the start turns out to be happening in a virtual reality constructed in somebody's mind. When you see all the characters reclining unconscious a la Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the gang 'in the real world', there was a 'Matrix rip-off' alert going off inside me! Im just shocked that only the Independent (UK), New York Observer, Village Voice and a few other reputable critics have managed to see through your borderline plagiarism-filled, overlong, ridiculously plotted, boring, self-important excuse for a movie. Lucky for you, everyone seems to love it. Did you enter their unconscious and plant the idea??? Its a really bad idea to try and rip off the Matrix. That movie has been made already. Its a really good movie. Unfortunately, Mr. Nolan, you didn't come up with the idea for that movie. The Wachowski brothers did. Get over it. Make your own movies. I thought Dark Knight and Memento and some of your other flicks were fine and enjoyable but this is utter garbage. Why didn't you go all the way and get Leo to wear a full-length leather jacket and master some Kung Fu techniques? Some folks left early (lucky for them). I'll be urging everyone not to waste time or money on seeing this crap. Sincerely Eoghan",0
"Inception is one of the boring overrated films I have ever seen. Let's start with the plot of the movie. Basically they have to go into a dream world to convince a guy to do something. Why? Why don't they just kidnap him, threaten to kill him or someone he loves if he doesn't do it. Could have made a decent little flick. Nope, lets waste 3 hours falling in a van and wondering if we are in a dream world. Boring. I think this is the I love Nolan fans boys thinking he can do no wrong. I like Nolan, interstellar was a good film, so was batman begins and the dark knight (the other 1 was terrible) maybe it's me but I think this movie is very overrated, I gave it a 1 because its probably a 4 at best(not 8.8), the effects in the film are great but that doesn't make a good movie in my opinion",0
Despite watching the first hour of the movie I was none the wiser. It just seemed to get more pointless as it wore on. I know it is about dreams but my dreams are way better than anything in this movie. Consequently I was unable to finish watching. I wasn't able to identify or empathise with any of the characters. There is a probably a script in there somewhere but in decades of watching films this is the first one I have given up on entirely. I doesn't help to have Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Caine - neither of whom ever appear to do any acting. I was thinking that Aeon Flux is a movie that explores similar territory but looks great even if it is somewhat incoherent also.,0
"If you must watch this caper then I would recommend you watch it as if you were watching a comedy. At least then its tolerable. As you watch just imagine the delirious brainwashed mind salivating at the infantile plot. Titter away at the scenes and dialogue they perceive as intellectually gigantic (easy to spot). Guffaw at the endless streaming dialogue intended to inform their low IQ brain what's going on (otherwise they wouldn't have a clue, guaranteed) I have no complaints about the acting or the production in general. I do however have to complain about the annoying score which was terribly loud. At times it was so loud it was actually painful in the mid range.",0
"This movie seemed like it was going to be a different and original, but it became so convoluted to the point that the main goal or focus of the movie was lost in the shuffle. Sure the visuals were interesting at times, but the buildup, background, preparation and complexity of drilling down into different sleep levels diluted character development or any interest in what the characters were trying to achieve. The movie was out of balance in so many ways. Cobb presumably had the ability and resources to fly around the world and manage small tactical assault teams, but could not arrange to meet his kids somewhere? Fischer just buys in to whatever Cobb is selling and goes along participating in deeper levels? Hundreds, if not thousands of bullets fired and only one character gets hit? How much film time was given to the backs of two kids or the falling van? Leo was okay with what he was given to work with, but Ellen Page was miscast and was terrible. The script and storyline could have been much tighter and the combined effort of all resulted in a ho-hum, bad remix of Avatar, Mission Impossible and the Matrix. Maybe the video game will be better.",0
"In other circumstances I'd call this movie a nice roller-coaster action ride, not great, but fun to watch.But with regard to a lot of seemingly competent film critics claiming this movie to be the be all end all of what a brilliant movie can be, it makes me kinda sad. It makes me really sympathize with all the reviews here calling Inception dumb. But that's the point, really, it's even a nice phrasing in my opinion. On the one hand I find it really astonishing that some producers understood the NEED for deep, challenging, meaningful movies. But instead of creating a thought provoking movie they just produced one that looks like it, trying to mimic the clues which make a movie seem deep... I'd phrase that perverted.Otherwise I don't have to add much to what has already been posted here. The topic of dreams has a lot of potential but instead Inception constrains it to a small logical prison which neither has any reference to real neuolobiogical science nor does it take on the endless creative possibilities of what dreams are about. Anyone who has some memories of dreams or experience with lucid dreaming will know.Since I loved Memento I'm flabbergasted. I think Nolan's able to do way better and stand for clever movies. But not with Inception. I know about taste and how everyone has another one and such... but imaging a scenario of future ""brilliant"" movies and how they'd take Inception as a role model, how marketing tries to mock terms like ""clever"" and ""thought provoking"", with thousands of pseudo-intellectual movies spreading all over the world. And in the end no one knows anymore when you really can expect an engaging movie - that's NOT the future I'd like to see. Insofar : Inception: Dumb. Thank you.Would the author of Inception only have listened to its own script: ""Don't be afraid to dream of something big.""",0
"Nolan gets lost/off in the baroque intricacies of his ""mind-bending"" plot at the expense of pretty much everything else. The talents of the many excellent actors thrown together to create this pretentious, money-sucking crap are simply wasted. Don't expect any fire from these pieces of wood.Nolan asks the viewer to turn his brain on just enough to try to follow the idea (you have to suffer through an unbearable amount of exposition), but then hopes that enough action, effects and oppressive soundtrack will stun that same brain into not questioning the ridiculous character motives, sloppy plot contrivances, and breaking and bending of his movie's own rules. If you feel like you haven't heretofore been sufficiently crushed by suspension of disbelief and reason, then this is your movie.As an aside, the movie felt like a converted book or graphic novel and it's likely this non-existent original medium would have allowed for a more credible attempt at floating this turd.",0
"This movie has some great special effects. The acting is pretty decent. That is about all I can say to its credit. Inception is a textbook example of the Hollywood hype machine in full effect.The much-vaunted plot is interesting but derivative, failing to live up to its 'mind-bending' reputation. You would be much better off watching a film like Videodrome or the animated film Mindgame if you want to truly be thrown sideways. This one is about as deep as Total Recall, but takes itself about ten times as seriously.I gave this a one merely as a corrective to the ridiculously high score that only a team of studio clerks working round the clock could have pushed to such a level. All in all it is a quite enjoyable film. I would watch it on TV if there was not much else on. But that is as far as it goes. There, now you are fully inoculated against the hype, go fourth and watch or not, free from utopian delusions.",0
"This is a movie that definitely was majorly hyped as Matrix meets James Bond. It was neither. The plot is very confused and unless you want to start a chart be prepared to miss a few things here and there. One reviewer earlier said you have to watch it at least twice to understand it. REALLY??? A dream inside a dream inside another dream and inside yet another dream only to realize at the end the whole movie was a dream so it was yet another layer deep. Please.... just tell the story. A 2 hour plus movie that shows the same flashbacks again and again just to prove the the lead character is deeply mourning and hiding something. I swear if I saw the same cutaway scene of his 2 kids again I was going to scream.The graphics are mediocre at best... CGI is CGI it's not new guys. Just because you can bend a street..... doesn't make it as ground breaking as Matrix... whoopee! As for James Bond.... not really. A few gun battles and a grenade don;t make you a James Bond. Besides James Bond is based on a character who fights for queen and country.... not to rip off a company for personal gains. At best these scenes are comparable to a first person shooter like Battlefield.The main character played by Leo is the same character over and over from him. Shutter Island, The Aviator, The Island, etc is a deeply troubled character with secrets which end up cursing the main character to sacrifice. It's tried and boring from Leo... branch out buddy... your not getting any younger.Overall, this was just not as hyped as a lot of movies are these days. A movie that is about 30 minutes longer than it should and with high priced talent which could have been performed better by lesser more able actors.... I say save your $15 and wait a few months till its on HBO",0
"Could this possibly be the same Christopher Nolan that gave us the classic ""Dark Knight""? What a letdown! What a sleep inducing, pretentious, rip off this mess was. Even with the obvious attempt by Nolan to instill a sense of sophistication with his use of high Brahman pseudo scientific dialog, it still couldn't save this bow-wow of a film, the script must have been written by somnambulist. If the producers of Inception would have changed all the high brow dialog and spoken plain English it still wouldn't have made any sense. I was almost snoring and in my own dream state of Inception after sitting through what seemed to be the whole first half of the movie, listening to Leonardo Di Caprio keep describing how the whole Inception theory worked, wake me up when it's over! Then when ""Cobb"" (LDC), goes to his angry Father In Law for assistance he gets a young college student as an assistant, Say Whaaat! The scenes concerning Cobbs dream life with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard) were beside the point and, or better yet there was no point. Those special effects that Cobb shared with his assistant, the college girl, were just unimaginative and boring, buildings folding up and turning upside down, huh? what's the appeal in that? And we keep reading about the new boy wonder replacement for the brilliant Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, are you kidding? This scrawny pencil neck could never walk in Heath Ledgers shoes! Actually none of the actors in this movie instilled any emotion or gave any credibility to their characters, they were syrupy and one-dimensional.Also the too loud, obnoxious, Wagnerian like, music score was driving me to grind my teeth and wish for drink by the time the movie finally ended, and it was still blasting away as we escaped this torment and hit the exit. No matter how loud, heroic, and operatic the music score it still couldn't save this dog of a movie. Great science fiction movies would be on the level of ""Blade Runner, Alien, District 9, Predator, even Avatar, this attempt at that genre fell flat on it's face, it was too long, boring, and narcissistic. I feel more suspense and get more action when fishing, I'm 64 years old and have been watching movies all my life, I can't remember watching a more pretentious, precious, and sleep inducing attempt at a movie. Batman couldn't save this film.",0
"Ugh, where to begin? This is without doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I know I stand pretty alone in saying this, everyone else loves it at the moment. I just guess I'm no fan of surrealist art, and don't get me wrong - this is, if there ever was, a surrealist moving picture. It's like watching James Bond while you're high. Y'know, James Bond in the sky with diamonds? I guess that doesn't really work though.I don't know why this film has my dislike. It has good actors, good jokes and very visually stunning sets. Yes, I know what it's about. Yes, it's mostly in a dream. Or, a while in, In a dream of a dream of a dream of a dream. Yes I get the whole time thing. 5 minutes in Inception equals 1 hour in reality. Yes I know because it's set in a dream world this gives it license to do surreal things that would happen in a dream.Stuff it, call me simple but after so long of a Soundtrack that sounds like a stuck record, landscapes filled with surrealist artwork, people I can barely hear speak, Jokes that seem out of place and just plain weird weirdness AND ON TOP OF THAT a story that I didn't pick up interest on when the movie started and I most certainly did not by the time it finished - it all just seemed like white blur. The snow didn't help much either.To be completely honest I just sat through a movie that most now regard a masterpiece and was bored out of my skull. When I left I felt horrible and tense and unsure as to whether or not I just watched anything at all. I guess it just all blurred together, won't be seeing that again if I can help it.1/10",0
"While I risk angering everyone caught up in the fervor surrounding this film, I have to say that I was left unsatisfied. The visuals are great but Nolan simply tries to pack too much information into too long of a movie, and mediocre (at best) dialogue does not help to lift the story. As a stand alone idea the film is brilliant, but this idea is only bogged down by the writers and the limited room for the actors to explore their roles. First off, DiCaprio is acting in a role that is far too similar to his previous part in Shutter Island, and he has no room to show his acting talent as he is constrained to situations where he must look constipated with mental pain and answer the frustratingly dumb questions from Ariadne (Paige). (Is that supposed to be Adriane? Arachnid? I was never really sure why no one could have normal people names) This is in no way the fault of Paige, DiCaprio, or any of the others forced to conform to a script that sounded more like a cheesy Jerry Bruckheimer action film than the mental candy that it is being made out to look like. (Lines like ""assemble your team!"" come to mind) My biggest problem, though, is the seemingly infinite collection of small faults in logic, personality of characters, and setting. The viewer must take many leaps of faith, excusing many holes in the plot and the way the plot is constructed. Once one of these holes in uncovered, and it inevitably will, because you leave the theater thinking, all of the others suddenly become very apparent. None of the characters have a personality, they are simply there to do the bidding of Nolan; unexplained, and unmotivated. We have no connection to the setting (or any of the settings) because they have no importance to the story. These events could be happening anywhere, and the backdrop just seems like an excuse to say ""look! you're in a dream! did you know you're in a dream? what about now?"" With a confusing structure, poor script, inhuman characters, and no motivation for anything (the viewer is told when to be more interested by the booms from the soundtrack), Inception is an idea that has been polluted by the desire to create an awesome summer blockbuster. Nolan dances around his brilliant idea, which in itself drives this movie up to a 5/10, but he never touches it, and too afraid to ask one probing question to the audience with any sort of clarity, choosing instead to pose a plethora of confusing questions that only serve to dilute the films core; a center which it pains me to say is pure genius.",0
"I wanted to like Inception, I really did. I tried so hard to like it. So many of my friends loved it. I thought I would love it. First of all, the story takes forever to get going. The slow pace at the beginning of the film is nauseating. And there is no explaining of what exactly they put on their arms? Or did I douse off during that? The drastic, loud music is there to make the movie more suspenseful than it really is. Which I kindly had to explain to my girl friend. If the music wasn't there, you really wouldn't have thought it was that suspenseful/thrilling. People have compared this to Matrix. Right, I sort of get that. But the Matrix was SO ground breaking! The Matrix made you love Neo and the action was supposed to be in the film. Inception the action feels forced. This isn't a thriller it was an Action Film. Mindless dribble talked about felt as if they were mumbling -- once you get that you get a bunch of characters you don't care about. Leo crying about his family AGAIN?! How many movies can I take with him crying about his family?All the action in the film and the different scenery reminded me much more of a James Bond film than anything. Go from the City, to the Snowy White Mountains to The Beach. I was just waiting for James Bond to come in on a silver coupe BMW and say, ""Bond, James Bond."" Sure you don't ever want to compare films to other movies. But look at Shutter Island and compare it to this. A lot of people didn't like Shutter Island, and those same people LOVE Inception. Shutter Island was classic film making. This is a modern action film.People also need to watch Memento. Watch how this movie should have been done.",0
"I went to see this film with very high expectations due to raving reviews (Roger Ebert a.o.), but unfortunately it turned out to be nothing more than an action flick with too much action and overdone special effects. The story is about dream tapping, whereby people are able to step into and figure in other people's dreams. That is about as ""deep"" as the film gets, no double layers (other than tapping into a dream within a dream), no philosophical double doors or anything else that could be slightly intellectually challenging for an educated viewer. With the budget that was made available for this film (USD 160m) they should at least have hired a couple of professional writers to make it work. Dialogues are very poor. At one point the girl, his own apprentice, explains Leonardo DiCaprio in a panicky situation that ""it's a projection, remember"", as if Leo's character wouldn't know that. And why would a normal person's (not a Navy Seal's) subconscious (in this case Robert Fischer's) bring in dozens of guys with uzi's etc from all corners when under stress? It makes no sense at all. Without all the special effects it could have been a much more powerful film, despite the poor storyline. By far it does not stand up to a film like The Sixth Sense (much less special effects, much more thrilling), or even A Single Man with Colin Firth which I saw this same weekend. We know that everybody dreams while sleeping, but the mystery of dreaming has nothing to do with special effects or spectacular shootouts. When we dream we touch on the unknown, and that is what creates the suspense and mystery after we wake up. That Christopher Nolan, who apparently is mesmerized by dreams or why else would he have written this nonsense, did not touch on this but on the contrary just threw money at ridiculous visual effects and bullet holes, is anybody's guess. To me this film is a demonstration of this director's pretentiousness and his creativity that only goes so far as blowing up stuff. I don't understand how some writers in serious newspapers can compare Christopher Nolan to Stanley Kubrick. The score is 0 - 15. Luckily Nolan is not 40 yet, so hopefully he will come back with something more stimulating out of the money he will make from Inception.",0
"I liked this movie but no way was it as great as everyone is saying. Beautifully filmed and Directed Is not enough to be considered great. The premise of breaking into someones dream even if it is in a SiFi movie needs to be set up or established somehow, this movie which seems to be set in current times, treats it like a common daily occurrence. The whole purpose of bringing in the girl architect to design a maze where they could out maneuverer the projections seems to have been thrown out the window once the chases started. The dialog gets hard to follow with all the action going on and character development and acting also fall victim to the nonstop mayhem. DiCaprio squinting into the camera is not Oscar worthy acting. While the action is top notch, I didn't really develop any connection with the characters and in many scenes it was hard to tell the good guys from the bad, when both good guys and bad are all dressed in white and running around shooting each other, it's kind of like watching a football game where both teams wear the same uniforms and no numbers. A good summer action movie but with too many flaws to get a 9.3 rating.",0
"My wife and I went to this movie with high expectations. Unfortunately, I relied too heavily on the critics and IMDb's rating. The acting was good which would normally mean a higher rating, but I disliked this movie so much, I couldn't give it higher than one star.The theory of the movie is complicated and, I believe, not well explained. By the end, which I thought would never come, I felt I understood the basics but not much more (maybe my wife and I are just to dumb to grasp the intricacies).Some of the special effects were excellent, but for the most part they went on way to long. A good editing job could have eliminate enough to get the film below 2 hours. Many of the action scenes in the snow could have been eliminated altogetherMy wife and I are retired and go to a lot of movies. We thoroughly enjoyed Knight and Day which has only grossed $70 million but avoided like the plague the newer movie Grown Ups which has already grossed over $130 million. It's unfortunate, but stupid is in.When you see so many movies like we do your requirements may be higher. I want a reasonably good story, good acting, and a entertaining experience. We loved Hangover, Kick-Ass, and Toy Story 3. There was quality and entertainment in each. Except for the special effects, I can't say the same about Inception.",0
"Spoiler warning.This film is just overrated beyond belief. The genius in this movie, is that it makes viewers feel like they are a genius, feeling they understand what is going on and that they are very smart for it because the story is so complex. Yes it is complex, but it is totally incoherent and illogical and the complexity is not contributing but quite the opposite. The complexity is uncalled for and unnecessary. The people following and attacking the protagonists are all heavily armed and professional armed forces. Yet their aim skills seem to be non-existent. Heavy machine guns, explosives, sniper-rifles and the only on who got shot was Mr. Ciao or whatever his name was (the characters were so non engaging, I can't even remember their names after just finishing watching the movie). Also the music is just horrendous and totally over the top.The only thing I got from this movie was a headache. Totally wasted these 2.5 hours on nothing but more Hollywood American blockbuster filth.",0
"hi as ever when you start writing here its because you have had a strong reaction one way or another. the strong reaction here is that the film gets a 9 out of 10 rating and this is way way too high. the film uses the Freudian idea of the mind as having depth, multi layered and having defenses he uses this idea to create an action film. the idea of defense means that the director spends literally long periods of the film with people shooting each other as the defense attacks the people coming into the mind. as a result this is a one dimensional look at dreams, so its James bond meets psychology...it really doesn't work.....don't believe the hypethanks will & vero",0
"Dreams are colorless, you can not read in them and you don't dream about dreaming. You might jump from dream to dream and you can live a dream more intensely but you don't dream in a dream. You can not share or enter a dream, it has never been achieved in the least possible way. Lastly if it rains outside you don't obligatory dream about it.If this was only the protagonists dream and he woke up: You can't find catharsis in a dream, you might wake up feeling uneasy from a nightmare or wake up feeling good from a good dream, but that's it.If he didn't: If he fell in a coma from the use of those drugs or whatever, he saw strange dreams, so what? He failed, his wife failed to bring him back, no point.If he did went home and things are what they appear to be the plot holes are abundant: 1. If you can get you hands on the president and CEO of a multinational conglomerate you don't need his secrets to begin with. Those sections are ridiculous, Saito and Fischer should have an army of bodyguards or at least some aids around them at all times. 2. Why Saito hire Cobb? He fail to extract from him. 3. Why don't they know Fischer is trained? That is the only thing they had to make sure and triple check. 4. When they wake up why they are not angry at Coob for lying to them and the danger he put them through? 5. What scum sends a little college girl on a job like this? 6. They plan to stay in the dream for ten years but when cornered they make stuff up, succeed and are out in a day. Why not plan that from the beginning? 7. Inception is easy. Take some random numbers from the victim, put them as combination on a safe that you made, disguise yourself ala mission impossible and voil_. Why doesn't everybody doing it? 8. Fischer is specially trained for just this kind of thing but doesn't have a totem to blow the hole plan apart? 9. Mal jumped from another hotel room, isn't there a paper trail or forensic evidence to that room? Or even a single witness? Being declared sane by three different psychiatrists does not look strange at the polices eyes? 10. If you want to see your children put them on a plane, make a video call, have them send pictures for god sake. 11. The entire rule set of the dreams is illogical in its own context and the time passing between the tree layers makes no sense, nor could it make because of its complexity. It would need an entire book to be attempted at.Artistically it is shot with skill, it is immersing, the effects are good and I did watched all of it for the cinematography. But pointless is pointless.Also when movies end this way, meaning with two options for the viewer, either he is still dreaming or he woke up, does not make a good movie or a good ending. Good ending makes open interpretation from many points of view, for characters ultimate motives, for questions of what is done is done for good or ill, etc. Here the characters are evil and they want to destroy thousand of peoples lives(Destroying Fischer company) for money, Cut and dry.To conclude I want to say that this has nothing to do with dreams. Dreams do not work that way, we all know that. This is a sci-fi movie about how dreams might have worked but even in that context doesn't make sense like I said. Watch but don't take seriously.",0
"You might think that a movie that literally sets itself up to play with people's dreams would have a broad vision and try to break through boundaries. But sadly, an engaging start to the film quickly leads to a sense of claustrophobia, as the viewer is forced down an increasingly predictable sequence of action scenes. And while the action is certainly well choreographed and executed, it's nothing that we haven't seen before.Worse, the run-on exposition by the characters, who are constantly reciting (and then literally re-citing) the Rules of the Inceptionverse, leaves precious little to actually think about. This film is not awful, but it's also far from being the deep and thought-provoking cinematic masterpiece that some viewers would have you believe.Go in with lower expectations, and you might be less disappointed :-)",0
"This film starts out dull and very rarely ventures away from this state. 'People in dreams' has been done before and is usually just a reason for showing of clever visual effects. Inception is no exception.The recruitment of a new architect is a joke. Draw me a maze that takes me 2 minutes to solve. Fail, Fail, Fail hang on a minute how about a circular maze. Genius your in.I don't completely hate this film but it could have been so much better. It could have been a great action film or a great drama piece. It tried to be both and managed neither.And finally, is he still dreaming at the end?.... Who cares.",0
"This aims to be Memento, but Nolan hasn't been able to produce anything with as much depth as Memento since his second film; I understand that would be difficult to do as I'm a huge fan of Nolan and Memento. This story however is extremely hallow and full of unnecessary action for the sake of action. This is pop corn; this is bubble gum. Inception doesn't come close to depths of Memento. This is a very good action/sci-fi movie, but not a great one at that. It was made to sell a lot of tickets and a lot of popcorn, but there is no other reason this film exists much beyond that. To try and pass this off as a deep film is an insult to many filmmakers that came before and are still around now. It's even an insult to Nolan's own Memento. This movie is based around a trick. And maybe it's even a good trick. Maybe it's not? But in the end, it feels like I watched this for the same reason I would do a crossword puzzle or a brain tease-to have an entertaining mental challenge for a brief moment, but this movie doesn't go much beyond that. I didn't care about the characters, if Nolan wanted me to care about these characters he would have spend more time with the characters, gone deeper into the relationship between DiCaprio and his wife, but instead he spent more time with silly mind tricks and mindless gunfights so that you'd spend more on popcorn. This movie insulted my intelligence by thinking that I'd be wooed by this empty, hallow mind trick.",0
"Dear Mr. Nolan.I am writing to you about that movie you made, ""Inception"".I am sorry but I have to tell you that I find it really annoying.The only part I liked is when Leo and the girl sit in the café and he explains to her that it is a shared dream they're creating. Then she walks around and tinkers with the dream world as she pleases.Which means doing stuff that is interesting to look at yet ultimately totally pointless. While people walk by and stare at her. Yeah, seriously. That's all they do. What an interesting dream. You know I can have that (the staring part) in real life whenever I want to, I don't need to (or want to) go to the cinema for that.Some physics experiments later Leo goes on to tell her that, for some reason, he doesn't like it when she recreates large chunks of her real memories in the dream world.Huh you say? Yeah, I say that too.Supposedly it is because that sort of creative action ""makes her lose grip on what's real and what's not"".Uhm. You know what? That is just nonsense. You can create dream worlds all day long and it does not make you lose any grip on anything.Sadly, the movie goes steeply downhill from there.Music that is supposed to sound ominous sets in and never stops for the rest of the movie. It's the kind of atmosphere that tells me right away that whatever happens on screen is not worth watching because it's just frightened clueless people telling each other ""serious stuff"". Kinda like politicians talking to each other. I hope you forgive me that I skipped through most of this while watching the movie.After a lot of that BS a guy who is in way too many movies (Michael Caine), appears and the flick ends.Here is the larger picture.""Inception"" is part of what I call the ""New American Madness"". Movies of despair, disjointed, logic falling apart, stories making no sense. Everything always seems dangerous and ominous, but nobody knows why and nothing leads anywhere.The cinema worlds of the New American Madness can be seen as a reflection of America's wars in Iraq (halfway past), Afghanistan (current) and North America (upcoming) which are really nothing but large-scale implementations of insanity. You really shouldn't think about this stuff too much lest you like to go insane yourself.To sum this up, Mr. Nolan: Please find a proper story writer for your next movie. ""Memento"" was so, so, so good. wtf happened to you after that?Nevertheless! You are without doubt a talented artist and I wish you the best of luck for future endeavors. You might want to consider joining the peace movement which I happen to be spearheading.Greetings, New Spirit Jazz",0
"I read the reviews for this movie, asked my friends about it and decided to take a look. After about 45 minutes into it I found myself sorely disappointed with the acting, the story progression, and the development of the characters (no genuine or believable character development, other than the obvious and predictable growth of DiCaprio). Watanabe, Page, and Gordon-Levitt demonstrated some of the poorest acting I've seen since Con Air. Watanabe was difficult to understand 90% of the time. Gordon-Levitt's attempt to portray a cool & steely partner was grossly unbelievable. Page came across aggravating and, in many ways, out of place. The Bottom-line: I believe that the movie did a good job of hypnotizing everyone into thinking that the Matrix want-to-be story was deep or intriguing. Please don't waste your time seeing this movie.",0
"A corporate billionaire wants to eliminate his competition by implanting an idea in the subconscious of the man who stands to inherit the fortune, that he should dismantle the company into smaller entities. He hires Cobb (DiCaprio) to do this, who enlists a team. They tether together in dreams through a low-tech contraption that is never explained, which also puts them to sleep instantly.To implant this idea in the man's mind, they have to go very deep, a dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream. Down three layers. In each successive layer time speeds up so that hours in layer three is a few minutes in layer two, and seconds in layer one. To go three layers deep they need to take a sedative that is specially designed to deaden everything but the inner ear, so that the feeling of free-fall (called a KICK) will cause the subject to wake up. But one catch: using the sedative, if they die in the dream, their mind goes to ""limbo"" in real life, apparently a coma-like state.They need about 10 hours to accomplish their task. Luckily for them, the target (the billionaire's son) takes a plane from Paris to LA regularly, and the flight is 10 hours. Arrangements are made so the private jet has mechanical problems forcing the target to take a commercial jet. To ensure they won't be disturbed in first class, the billionaire who hatched this plan buys the airline ""because it seemed neater."" The dreamers carry their own talisman that reveals to the dreamer if they are awake or dreaming. Cobb has a small top that spins infinitely while dreaming, but in waking state it eventually topples. (How the other talismans work is never explained. Arthur has a loaded dye and the girl makes a chess-like piece. We never see them use theirs to check their state of reality, but Cobb uses his twice.)The details of how lucid dreaming works is conveniently concocted for the film. One of the dreamers constructs a world in the form of a maze for everyone else to use as the dreamscape. The subconscious mind of the target fills the landscape with their unguarded thoughts, allowing someone to steal their thoughts (or plant a thought). A dreamer can also introduce fears and guilt into the landscape which materialize as threats, buildings crumbling, etc.Cobb doesn't tell his team that he is deeply conflicted about planting a thought (inception) in his wife's mind, which was to question her reality. He did this while they lucid-dreamed together, which became an addiction, gradually revealed throughout the film as backstory. She finally jumped out a window to kill herself and wanted him to commit suicide with her, so before she jumped, she sent a letter to her lawyer saying her husband wanted her dead. Knowing he would get blamed for her suicidal jump, he fled the country to Paris and the entire movie takes place abroad. His drive to help the billionaire is a promised call 'to the right people' that will allow him to return home to be reunited with his two children. Cobb's guilty subconscious kept bringing his dead wife into the dreamscapes where she tries to kill others.The dream sequences themselves are long, drawn out, convoluted, and often boring. They try to distract you from this by having constant gunfire from ""projections"" that are nearly always attacking the main characters. The villain of the movie was psychological: Cobb's inner struggle. That was a major weakness because there was nothing to root against. And you don't care about the main objective either (the billionaire's plan) _ in fact the target is a more appealing character than anyone else in the film. So the only reason to sit through the entire movie is to see if Cobb gets to go home in the end, and frankly it takes the entire movie (if you don't walk out) to care about that too. And by then the only reason you care is b/c you sat through 2.5 hrs to see how it ends.The best scene, dramatically, is when they wake on the plane and each look at one another after going through so much (~2hrs worth!) in dream state. The billionaire makes a phone call as the plane lands in LA, and Cobb clears customs. He is met by his Father (or his ex wife's father?) who takes him home. Cobb walks into the house, sees his children playing outside (as we have seen in many sequences throughout the movie) but this time he calls their names, and they turn around and look at him. At the same time he drops his bags, and as a last action, takes out his talisman and spins in on the table, then rushes to greet his kids. We hold on it in foreground while he picks up his children in background.... zooming in on the spinning talisman until it occupies the entire screen.... spinning, spinning spinning.... it starts to wobble ever so slightly... and CUT TO BLACK. Leaving viewers unsure if Cobb was still dreaming.The ending was good and there were two other noteworthy scenes. One is a fight scene in zero gravity in dream layer two, and another was in the movie trailer: the dreamscape curling in on itself to form a cube.Unfortunately, I didn't care about any of the characters nor was there any emotional investment in the main plot. Who cares if a billionaire gets his competition to breakdown his empire? And I also didn't care much if Cobb was reunited with his kids, as there is one lone scene of a phone call he makes to them that is supposed to establish our emotional investment, and it fell way short of doing that. Finally, as previously stated, there is no villain except for Cobb's guilt over his wife's death. I struggled to sit through this film.",0
"Once again Hollywood grinds out another shoot-em-up, this time in the guise of a mind-exploration film. Come on: who's fooling whom? the film is directed at an audience whose attention span has been honed on video games: they can't go on unless he/she sees a dead body or car crash every second.As for the story, why not have all parties sit down and chill out on good weed or opium? Much cheaper than getting all those guns and first-class plane tickets. Some roles are dreadfully miscast. Watanabe's English is just not up to snuff and Ellen Young looks totally inappropriate.And that ending! ""Citizen Kane"" accomplished the same thing with a lot less bloodshed and just one memorable word, ""Rosebud"".",0
"If they were going in to subvert a subconscious mind that most likely would defend itself, Why didn't they dream up some bullet proof vests for themselves? Or some werewolves.It's a dream right? If I was going into someone's mind I would be Wolverine or Optimus Prime, I would carry a light saber. The movie claimed that the more a dream is tampered with the more a subconscious will reject it, but they constructed some pretty elaborate realities before that would start to happen. Heck in one the world was turned completely upside down and the subconscious was only mildly upset, I think I could sneak some Iron Man armor in there.I'm still not convinced that the whole movie was a dream. Ellen Page's character literally comes out of nowhere acquires some impressive dream manipulation skills in one day and then happily falls in with criminals that want to invade someone's mind in an attempt at corporate espionage... okay. And maybe I missed it but, what exactly was the movie science explanation behind this? Take these drugs plug this in your arm and we can share dreams YAAAYYY! And another thing if I was facing charges because I planted an idea in someone's head that led to their death I wouldn't flee the country I wouldn't even ask for a lawyer, the first words out of my mouth would be ""get me the CIA."" You wouldn't even see the inside of a courtroom you would be super spy extraordinaire.If you don't believe me check this out http://www.IMDb.com/find?s=all&q=dreamscape",0
"I want my money back. This movie was long, boring, the storyline made no sense and every time you tried to make sense of it they would throw in visual effects that were frankly, pathetic. Do not believe the ""fresh"" reviews. The movie is so overrated and all the characters are so annoying. The ending was predictable and a disappointing. It's not a good sign when people are shrugging at each other or snoring. What a waste--those $200 million could have been spent on our economy. Ugh. Save yourselves! Honestly, the movie is a rip off of a Japanese animation film called Paprika. It also rips off ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and the ""Matrix."" You do not relate or even care about the characters. They did so much explaining (they had to) that it was like, just give me the script and I'll read it at home, already. There was so much confusion in the the theater and the smart people left the first 45 mins. I wanted it to get better, for the sake of my wallet, to no avail. This movie is a ""Product"" that did not deliver, so I wish I had the balls to demand my money back.",0
"As much as I really wanted to enjoy this film, it took me all my patience to be able to sit through the whole debacle.Anyone who expected anything as good as The Matrix will be sadly disappointed. I am astonished at the positive reviews this film has received so far.As an idea, this could have been genius.Instead it was a drawn out, over complex, sleep inducing nightmare for us.Dicaprio looked like he had stayed on Shutter Island.The only redeeming actor was the young Ellen Page who was excellent.Sorry folks but i'm just being honest-an appalling film.",0
"This abortion should have remained in the trash can. Willful suspension of disbelief is one thing, but insulting the intelligence of a 5 year old is another.Save yourself, watch literally anything else.",0
"People were telling for months before I watched it how unbelievably amazing this film is. Anyone who says so is MISTAKEN. This film is pure bullshit. So they're in a dream within a dream within a dream and if they die in any of those dreams they'll never wake? Seriously!? The whole premise is utterly pointless and I couldn't care less about any of the characters. I guess with this films high rating on IMDb that most people really enjoyed it so my viewpoint is probably unpopular. If I hadn't had a Dozen different people tell me how amazing it was before I'd seen it I might not have thought quite as shockingly bad, but even so this film is a seriously poor effort and doesn't begin to compare with Momento.",0
"Watching Inception, I actually felt as if I had lost my short term memory faculty. I think various characters, especially little DiCaprio and his sidekick Joeph Gordon-Levitt, were forever explaining things. What had happened, what would happen, why somethings might happen and why other things might not happen etc etc. But after a while it became impossible to retain the nonsensical gobbledygook that was being spouted and I kept asking myself why are they doing this, why are they doing that? Why are they in the middle of a snow covered mountain? Why is that guy floating around, tying everybody up and stuffing them down a lift shaft? I think all this was explained. Was it? Oh I can't remember. But then a sense of complete ennui took over my body. A listlessness so total that I could not summon up the energy to even try to follow this nonsense.Today's film makers often pay their respects to the great directors of the past, but their praise and appreciation is entirely bogus. It cannot be otherwise, considering they have no notion how to develop plot, how to create characters that live and breathe and exude vitality. For Christopher Nolan, wit drama and tension may be beyond him, but surely simple coherence is not too much to ask? I am very aware that many people love this film, indeed some even declare it a work of genius (dear oh dear!), but there are some dissenting voices. And for those who recognise Inception for the nullity it is, I have more than once seen the story of ""The King's New Clothes"" being invoked to describe how so many people seem to have been taken in by this nothing of a picture. But whilst I agree with most of the views of the dissenters, I must take issue with those who use the ""King's New Clothes"" as a simile. And the reason is simple, this movie is not fit to mentioned in the same breath, even via an unflattering comparison as Hans Anderson's marvellous story. Anderson created, in a few short pages a storytelling masterpiece,; a strong narrative, compelling characters and a classic denouement, all told with brevity wit and clarity.And at the core of the story is an ethical and moral issue that people can, and have debated for centuries And all these characteristics in this gem of the storytellers art, are totally missing in Nolan's boring incoherent mess. In short, rather than be compared to Anderson's great little story, Nolan should be studying it closely to see how a story can be successfully told.",0
If this story was so compelling and thought provoking why was the word dream mentioned over 800 times. The only thing this film had going for it were the special effects which were excellent. The cast and acting were solid but you didn't care about any of the characters because the story was so convoluted despite the performances. The audience which were all SAG members were laughing at the end because it was so ridiculous trying so hard to make sense of the impossible. Long at 140 minutes maybe okay for special effect junkies but that's it. You wanted so hard for the story to stimulate the mind but that was an exercise in futility.,0
"I don't think there are serious spoilers but just to be safe it's marked.Not bad, but disappointing if this is the most intelligent movie Hollywood is making.I suppose if you haven't read or seen anything like this before, it may seem innovative. It is not an original idea... But then again, so many ideas are not. It could still have been a fine movie. But alas, it's a mess...Lets start with the obvious: The ""action"". So boring and pointless... I wish the money spent on all that could be sent to Haiti, or donated to fight climate change. It not only made the movie a mess, it was such a waste... Why do they feel every movie needs so many car chases, gunshots, blood, death, and general mayhem? I am disappointed that people today are not only assumed to not be able to deal with intellectual material without dumb, violent, presumably hedonistic fodder, but worse, that this perception is correct, based on the reviews this movie is getting.If you found this movie over the top and annoying try Moon and Primer, for recent examples of ""intelligent"" movies, the latter made for only a few thousand $.The dreams were not dream-like, at least as I experience them. My dreams are much less about crumbling buildings but at the same time, way more mysterious and weird. Too much talking in this dream world. It's almost always more effective to let the imagery haunt the viewer rather than spell it all out (think about the diner scene in Mulholland Drive, truly chilling and dream-like)... They did not capture the dream mood at all IMO...The ending was predictable from the very beginning. I sat there thinking ""really? I thought this was supposed to do a mind-bender"". Felt like a 14 year old read the wikipedia pages for Descartes, Plato and Aristotle while he's stoned and wrote this movie... Maybe it's not the movie's fault that media reports got my expectations geared towards a surprise ending... The ending is the most obvious thing that is possible in the context... I hope that doesn't ruin the movie for you!Possible spoiler: BEGIN Huge plot holes. Insults to your intelligence left and right. ""Limbo"" was such a cop-out. In one context (the job they're on), inception has to be super complicated (for no convincing reason), in another (Cobb & his wife) you simply tell someone something and there it is... Uneven mess.To me the movie was the ramblings of a junkie, the whole entire thing was a ""dream"". They didn't do much with the drug seeking and addict behavior the characters displayed (girl gets hooked first time, Cobb guy's ""doing it one last time""). If they layered that on, maybe it could have made it a bit more interesting. Minus the bomb and gunshot-fest though...Possible spoiler: END Finally, the other reason this fails: Who are these people and why do we care? Cobb is supposedly motivated by seeing his kids and cleaning up his act. Didn't work. I half expected the kids to have Rosemary's baby faces when they turned around (hell, it would have been a little bit dream-like, more so than all the annoying ski chases and such). I can't get engaged by flat characters no matter how many millions worth of CGI you pour on. The Matrix, a decidedly non-highbrow movie in this genre, had better developed characters.For the record, we don't use a small percentage of our brains. I can't believe this movie blatantly put that cliché in there in the 21st century. Again... Now I have to explain this even more at random parties... Joy! (I am a neuroscientist)Verdict: OK implementation of interesting idea (though not at all original). I wish I had not rewarded the studios who feel fine about spending millions on repetitive ideas implemented without grace, while the whole world is in the middle of a recession. Feels like Hollywood's too high on testosterone and cocaine these days...",0
"A DVD CHOICE, NOT A MOVIE THEATER CHOICE: First, allow me to say as an avid movie buff of 40 years, I have seen many flicks over the years, my tastes are varied, and I am the first to love something that will take you away from your world, into the world of a writer/director. That being said, it is of the utmost importance for me to be led, in a movie, to a point of intrigue, and visuals are of an equal importance as dialog when and where it comes to suspense. If not, the film is heavily reliant on a pretty, well known face, to keep your interest, while the flick drags on, with little relevant reason beyond verbal dribble to stay in your seat. There WERE a solid 5 or so minutes of effects, but the trailer leads you to believe there were much more. This flick allowed 90% verbal plot-building to create somewhat of a lack of suspense, a you-had-to-be-there, in my eyes, to drag a viewer into interest. Zero character building left it with a lack of relevance. I watched a surprising amount of people walk out of the theater, and more than I have ever seen leaving and coming back. They bought their ticket, but for some reason they weren't inclined to be pinned to the screen. I heard many utter the very same thing I was thinking, along with my date, while departing the theater... after 25 mins you are pretty much like what the heck is going on- I think we all followed along with the ""story"" as best we could, but the dead honest truth is that the first 10-20 mins are what creates an air of either interest, or turnoff... and INCEPTION left me with a lack of interest, either through writing and/or direction, that lasted throughout the 2.5 hours this movie dragged on. It was OK, but as my lady is saying beside me, you kept wishing through the first parts, for an ""ah!"" moment, then what came through more as confusing didn't ever seem to make up for that yearning, and judging from the reactions overheard when we were leaving, we were not alone in our assessment. Shortly, too many questions, not enough answers. WAIT FOR VIDEO, THEN PLAN ON REWINDING A FEW TIMES AND TAKING QUITE A FEW BREAKS TO PROCESS WHAT IS GOING THROUGH THE SEMI-BEWILDERED WRITER'S MIND.",0
"After reading up on the initial reviews before it premiered and watching the trailers, I expected a great movie. What I saw was a movie with a very interesting concept but for some reason there was a lot of action that was totally irrelevant for the story. I was mostly irritated about all the shooting and action since it did nothing but prolong the movie. In the end the movie has an interesting concept that gets mixed in with James Bond and all other action movies you can think of and it just feels like a total waste of time to go see this film. It is neither a good action movie nor a movie with a believable story. The movie just is not interesting and it does not feel unique.Go see something else!",0
"I was very excited to watch this movie, as i sat and watched these losers go to all this trouble to do some pointless mission, when they could have easily solved all this without going in someones dream. I just thought the Whole movie was over the top and i didn't care about any of the characters and o wanted them all to die, especially Juno. The story was stupid, no character development, everyone is afraid to say that this movie is boring and that people are still obsessed with that moronic dark knight movie. I think that if people would stop being so dazzled by special effects and watched the movie for what it really is they would see its just stupid and boring. If he knew how to make a good movie he would make it shorter. My main problem was that it was long, and everyone in it was acting poorly.",0
"This is one of the most hyped-up films in recent memory and I feel exactly the same way after I saw The Hurt Locker. Don't believe the hype - make up your own mind. I am a fan of Christopher Noland and DiCaprio and think Juno with Ellen Page is one of the most original films I have ever seen with her outstanding performance. But Inception is, please excuse my language, simply a gargantuan piece of crap. Illogical plot, weak acting, a plethora of unnecessary, distracting violence - the film never did it for me. After less than an hour I wanted to leave the movie theater, were it not for a niece evening with my wife in the unique and great Moolah theater in St. Louis. Simply disappointing and I just cannot believe what I read in the other reviews. Did you see the same movie?? Did you write up what you wanted to see or what you actually saw? Number #3 on the list of all-time greatest films?? Give me a break.",0
"Hate when this happens, as it did for Fish Called Wanda when everyone else in the universe loved it.Husband and I went to see last night, all excited. Last 45 minutes (after they for no reason I could figure out went to the snow world with more guns blasting) such a total bore, on a par with my old corporations class. We both considered walking out, could hardly make it through.Interesting original premise. Dreams are fascinating, unexplored realms. But the movie made by one with little talent for screen writing/moving making --to me -- needed some breaks in the action (see Shakespeare), and some much needed explanation such as how they started from the first moment being able to be in each others' dreams. And the little girlie -- ""super architect?"" Silly. She had no role. All the constant shoot-em-up--unnecessary--and headache-inducingly noisy. This could have been interesting if not combined with some modern day cowboy backdrop -- more story, less frenetic action. In short -- what on earth has everyone so excited? Heard someone outside the theater after discussing from which I concluded it's like the emperor's new clothes, no one wants to criticize for fear of seeming stupid. Well, stupid here. This sucked.",0
I watched 3/4 of the movie and I have to say it was painful. How this has an 8.8/10 rating is beyond me. The movie made no sense. Is he dreaming? What town are they in. Will he die or is it a dream. Just an awful awful movie.,0
"What a load of rubbish, you gotta love the way everyone gets real excited about a film that doesn't make any sense, hey, i don't get it, oh, so it must be an intelligent movie! People, movies are not intelligent, they are there for entertainment, and this one was just plain stupid, basically tripping over itself trying to be cleverer then it was supposed to be. Any intelligent human being who stops and thinks about it for 2 minutes will realise that it doesn't make sense at the beginning, nor at the end, and all the thickoes like that! because if it doesn't make sense to them, then it must be clever, no guys! give yourselves more credit then that, it's a load of rubbish!",0
"I've tried now to watch this movie on 2 or 3 separate occasions with an open mind and haven't been able to finish it. It's just too boring. If I were to see another scene of a DiCaprio explaining the plot and wacky dream world rules to one of his teammates, I couldn't even...Whenever they get to the snow/skiing scene like some James Bond movie, I yawn and turn it off.You know the premise is weak and/or over-complicated when the lead actor spends as much time narrating as he does acting. There are just so many unneeded layers, terms, and pseudo- philosophical/intellectual gobbledy gook asides. Just plain tacky. Chemists and architects (cast Jason Alexander in that role and we have a movie) and whatever Joseph Gordon-Levitt's job description was. Add in a phantom, delusional Marion Cotillard and a little gratuitous Michael Caine-- tell Chris Nolan he can leave Alfred out of this one.Here we have a plot with no real consequences that doesn't really explore anything of substance and with actors that seem to be going through the motions. It seemed like a pair of screenplay writers that were in an active competition to see who could obfuscate and torture the story line the most thoroughly; and they both won. Problematically, people tend to glorify and overrate things that feign sophistication and complexity. There isn't anything sophisticated here-- just made up, illogical, scene-serving hot garbage with some pretty CGI. This is a textbook style-over- substance movie.I can say, however, this movie was successful in subjecting me to inception. The idea implanted deep in my subconscious was that this was a really bad movie; a movie that is criminally overrated at 8.8/10. Yuck.",0
"I figured out this was all a dream because there were zero black people in the movie. The one minority in the movie is of course a drug dealer. Well played.*Spoiler* belowThe plot is wasted. The rich use idea extraction and inception contractors to change the future. In this particular case, to prevent a monopoly but there's no emotional connection or drama created. What will happen if they do not succeeded other than ""our employer will not accept failure"" ? Long movie and no real explanation. Try again. And this time ""take your time"". In the movie, while dreaming, 5 mins feels like an hour. Well, somebody wake these guys up and tell them they're talking too long to sound smart. I feel like this whole movie is in limbo waiting for someone to wake it up. The one good thing about Inception is the visuals. The scenes are beautiful. Whatever style of filming this is, it carried the movie throughout. Hopefully they make a sequel and create a back story. Otherwise, this movie is really stupid and the people who give it such a high rating can't explain the many holes in the story line.",0
"I have to give this movie a very low rating because I do find the story ludicrous, and by a mere stretch of fancy: a rip-off of its quintessential predecessor Matrix.I was absolutely astonished how utterly naive the response to Inception was when it was released.Firsty, the story induces the idea of people actually living inside their dreams, when it displays nothing of the surreal effects of real dreaming. Now, I happen to adore a good adaption of dream sequences. The best to date include Polanski's depiction of the crucial scene in Rosemary's Baby where she suddenly shouts: ""This is not a dream! It's really happening!"".Inception is a real charge for technocrats, in my opinion,",0
"how on earth this piece of crap is overrated is beyond me.btw.""The Matrix"" is like a million times better.I was like ""seriously??? XD""the fact that this is an action sci fi movie. remove the danger element from an action movie and it becomes pointless. this is a very boring one also. sci fi?the best part is when the buildings flip over each other. the rest is so dullwhatever action is taking in some little boys head is tasteless.they just play in his silly dreams to form a reality for him.everything else is substandard. some B movies are way better than this. ending is way too predictable. also a dream inside a dream that doesn't look like a dream and make sure the boy is not realizing he is dreaming is ridiculous. 2.5 hours seems like 10 hours. don't waste your time.",0
"I see all the glowing 10 star reviews and I am genuinely dumbfounded. It's just a second rate re-make of the Matrix. If you have 2 and 1/2 hours to spare, and are easily pleased you may find this mildly diverting. But to bill it as some kind of seismic event in the cultural history of western civilisation is just rubbish.The plot holes are bigger than the effects, the characters are entirely one dimensional and the dialogue is wooden. The final 30 minutes were spent staring at my watch, willing it to end, so I could go and do something more meaningful with my life, like watching some paint dry.I almost wonder if Christopher Nolan is playing games with us, trying to see how far he can push it before a small child steps forward and points out that the emperor is in fact completely naked.",0
"Like many others have said about this film is that its a complicated plot but not that hard to follow or concentrate on. Leonardo Dicaprio (Another actor in Lee's top 10) is the star of the film in yet another visual masterpiece from my new favourite director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) In this he portrays Cobb a Dream specialist who with a team he personally assembled of other dream experts except jobs from high rollers to either invade someone's dreams and steal something per say a combination to a safe that they only know etc etc. Or his team can do Inception jobs, go in a person's dreams and place an idea in their minds for something that a person per say in the real world knows they are capable of and just need a little push in the right direction. Great stellar cast that is rounded off with Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ellen Page, Ken Wantanabe and the always great Cillian Murphy.",0
"Really disappointing with a predictable ending.Far too long - lacked intelligence and little real depth.Derivative of 80's movie Dreamscape and later The Matrix among others.Too much ego Nolan - nice technical effects but nothing new.A poor script however the acting was good. They managed to keep a straight face throughout.As a connoisseur of sci fi movies in general it really didn't hit the mark, probably because it wanted to be a mainstream film.Could have done with at least 30 minutes cutting, the final third was actually boring and the endless action sequences just became a blur.Don't believe the hype - this is yet another summer 'blockbuster' that fails to hit the mark, although obviously better than Prince of Persia, Airbender and the really garbage stuff.",0
"I have the highest of regards for Nolan, his vision, Di Caprio and other individuals involved in the project. But seriously...what was that?Re-hash of existing ideas, poor editing, emotionless dialogs and lack of ""film"" feel. It would have been better as an animated movie. Leo was not caste right for this role. He needed someone older/mature for this. Norton, Clooney, Daniel Day Lewis, Denzel...would have been much better for this.In the end, you have 2001 Space Odyssey, Goodfellas, Shutter Island, Matrix and Memento in one script...which is just puke after eating good food from different cuisines. I bet Twilight fans are happy. I was banking upon this film to show-off what real cinema is. But sorry, Nolan better get back to basics and keep things simple and relative. That is what he is good at. This was Micheal Bay movie...not Nolan's.All I can say is, after reading 100s of positive reviews and the hype, this movie should be re-named Deception...",0
"There's a lot to be said in favour of 'Inception' such as great special effects and a new and interesting concept in which to set a film.However, although Sci-fi demands that probably impossible concepts in real life must be assumed to be able to happen, 'Inception' isn't consistent to these and jumps around and conveniently ignores its own rules.For example, needing a gravity kick in zero-gravity, Gordon-Levitt comes up with the great idea of using a free-falling lift to bring it about. Hello? There's zero-gravity everywhere - just by blowing the wires on a lift won't send it crashing into the basement.And, when Di Caprio needs to go and find a fellow traveller in the victim's mind, he does so even when the victim is awake, returning to consciousness from his 'dreamworld' (that is, the victim's 'dreamworld') when consciousness has already been recovered.And there are many other problems that space forbids me to relate.If this film was consistent to its own rules, it would have my vote of approval as being an original and compelling film but, unfortunately, there's no point inventing an alternative reality only to ignore the rules you've made and upon which the premise is based.",0
"Alright. I know that this movie is getting rave reviews, but after seeing it last night I am wondering why!? I saw a preview for this about 2 months ago and had been wanting to see it ever since. Geez, what a letdown once I finally saw it. Unfortunately, I can not think of one good thing to say about this movie. I was lost as to what was going on only after 5 minutes into this and it kept getting more complicated. I was expecting this movie to be on the weird side, but it made no sense to me whatsoever. I don't think I have ever wanted to walk out of a movie so much in my life. The only thing that kept me staying was the hope that this movie would pick up. It's 2 1/2 hours long and trust me, it feels like that and more! It's just rather dull. Nothing really going on, the effects are just OK...nothing to really save the movie. It didn't hold my interest, didn't keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next, there was no wow factor, nothing. Huge disappointment.",0
"This film thinks it's important. However, the movie says nothing about anything. All the dream stuff is made up by the writer. Nothing is based on real science. There is no explanation of anything other than just to state that things are. For example, there is no explanation on how this whole inception devise was created or how it works. Other examples are the proclamation in the movie that when you die in a dream, you wake up (oh really) Then there is the idea that if you die within a dream that's within a dream you go into ""limbo."" Whaaaaaaaaat! Everything that's required to put forth the story happens too conveniently. People and events happen at the right time just when they are supposed to happen.This is what happens when a movie is written, produced, and directed by the same person. The producer/writer/director doesn't have to worry about anyone telling him their are problems with the script. No checks and balances. The movie becomes very self-indulgent.The music was often so loud that the dialogue was muffled and the convoluted storyline was hard to follow.",0
"The worst cinema experience of my entire life.My wife had seen it before, yet she still recommended that we go and see it together when it did the local rounds. I should have suspected something when she described it as 'strange'.Don't waste two hours of your precious blood flow for this. Pure Hollywood indulgence. Pure nonsense. Good luck to them for making money.Horrendous noisy music score. Loads of gratuitous violence, people get shot dead yet that is deemed acceptable in dream world.I am really angry that I wasted money on this utter drivel.By the way, I did not like it.",0
It is probably just me since movies like The Matrix bore me to tears but I literally could barely stay awake during this nonsense. I am quickly coming to the conclusion that the Leonardo Di Caprio school of acting involves simply glowering and clenching his jaw during every scene. If you loved The Matrix you will probably like this but if you found The Matrix to be as boring as I did then you may want to avoid losing two hours of your life on this. Some of the computer graphics were compelling but this is strictly The Matrix from a different perspective and just as uninteresting. Go rent Fargo or some other decent movie and avoid wasting your time on this nonsense!,0
"So complicated and stilted that it became boring and silly. A ""kick,"" ""totem,"" ""levels,"" ""layers,"" ""dreams within dreams within dreams"" ""but that can't be done"" ""so let's add another level"" ""okay we can make that work"" etc. etc. etc. Just a huge bs fest presented in a way that attempts to make the viewer feel like they are learning something important. This despite the fact it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. IDK, reviewers here seemed to love it so maybe it's just me.",0
"Since this movie had such outstanding reviews, I thought you know what, I'm gunna sit down for three hours and watch this bad boy.Boom. Opening credits. By this point I had already put on my movie slippers and was eager to see what was going to happen next - my eyes fixed on the 42 inch screen like a super glue magnet attracted to the titanium alloy of the outside of a spaceship. Basically, I really like the feel of testicles in my mouth and anus so when I noticed that there were not gay scenes, I was severely disappointed and the film went downhill from there, two hours in and I was falling asleep. Leonardo Dicaprio played his part rather convincingly, however I grew tiresome of his crazy personality roughly half an hour into the movie. The rest of the supporting cast played their parts extremely captivatingly but it did not detract from the tired plot.Movieman out.",0
"The story concept is a mixed of The Matrix (1999) + The Thirteenth Floor (1999) + Dark City (1998) + Jacob's Ladder (1990) ... The dream planting idea is from Paprika (2006) The multiple layers of dream idea is from Perfect Blue (1998)It is a better movie than Shutter Island (2010), but doesn't make it worth all the buzz and box office success. Hollywood, just like any other American culture, is suffocating from all the NWO agendas - thus this mediocre sci-fi generated so much success compared to other ""sugar coated"" movies that requires 0% of using your brain such as Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), Going the Distance (2010), ... all these movies requires no imagination - pure visual receptions - just like porn.Maybe that's what the movie bosses want these days - further dumping down the population till they have no intellect to speak their minds, to think for themselves, just become a pack of sheep.

"While the conceptualization in this film was better in some ways than the movies it can and obviously will be compared to such as the Matrix trilogy,What Dreams May Come, The Cell, Memento etc., Inception is a tepid foray into brain-twisting cinema. Though it was enjoyable to wade through in some parts (the high tension in any of the scenes that Cotillard's Mal appears in), over all it was a lackluster and vacuous failed masterpiece of the same ilk as a Thomas Kinkade painting. To wit: after you realize that those pretty glowing windows embedded in pretty little thatched cottages and dreamily lit street lamps are all the same cookie cut-outs, without context or variation, you are either irretrievably bored or just plain irritated by the time your brain wasted on this pretty patchwork of nothing - or both.Most of the cast is just pacing the prosaic floors of patent ""decent"" acting against Nolan's backdrop abyss of homogenized scenery. Two notable exceptions to this were Marion Cotillard as Mal and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur. I found myself rousing to pay more attention when both were on screen. Cotillard fairly stole the movie (not a necessarily hard feat, given that the rest of the cast aside from Gordon-Levitt appeared to be sleepwalking through most of it) keeping one on edge waiting for (and hoping desperately for) ""Mal"" to return in some way to cause havoc. The name Mal is a complete symbolic stretch as the word ""mal"" in French means ""evil"" or ""bad."" Is Mr. Nolan attempting to moderate a Great Books club examination of symbolism in junior high literature?Gordon-Levitt's Arthur is a cool character that screams of being secretly afflicted with OCD. He's definitely ready for more mature roles, but this film could not do his performance justice. DiCaprio turns in a solid, if not slightly bland, performance. The role was clearly not much of a stretch for him and immensely less compelling than his performances recently in films such as The Departed, Shutter Island and Redemption Road.My biggest issue with the movie is with the casting of Ellen Page as Ariadne. First, the character of Ariadne is even weaker and more limpid by contrast to the other characters. It is not the youth and inexperience of the unseasoned apprentice that is driving the weakness of the character. It is the character altogether and the way in which it and the corresponding dialogue was written. In addition (and this will no doubt be an unpopular assessment), Ellen Page has once again turned in an uninspired, wooden, robotic performance. Juno was perfect casting for Page and I enjoyed her in that movie in-so-much as she was practically playing her unflappable, sarcastic, pseudo-intellectual-underachiever self. Great role, but from what I've seen of her after that - a complete one-off. In Inception she appears asexual in contrast to Cotillard who fairly oozes the stuff of warm bodies and sexuality even in death and as a ghost of a memory. While the part may not have required Page to be overtly sexual, her lack of anything approaching genuine emotion and reaction ends up further robbing her portrayal of veracity and meat. Playing against DiCaprio, who is able to channel and evince convincing emotion and reaction at the drop of a hat, does not help her case.The backdrop scenery and visual conception was a CGI snooze fest. The intended poignant (and, again, symbolically heavy-handed) decaying ruins juxtaposed with the generic modern linear lines of any old corporately urban scape are meant to showcase the mind's dilemmas and free-style architectural skills when in a dream state. Instead of exploring and creating these scapes in some Borgesesque way that might actually tease order into chaos and the reverse, these elaborate digitized models looked like the computerized simulations an urban-planning student might create to illustrate how a disaster effects structures or where to build the next access ramp - confusing, decaying, crumbling and boring. I initially gave this film a much better review. Unfortunately for it, I watched both Chinatown and The Godfather II the very next day and snapped back into the realities of what master filmmaking should be. I must hand it to the studio on this one: your mega publicity campaign for this film served you well. You managed to convince a movie-going public that is so much in the throes of economic and political turmoil that it wants nothing so much as an escape into a good film for a few hours that this film is much, much more innovative and substantive than it can ever deliver on.",0
"OK, this film did have great effects. And it had potential to be a great film. But sadly, it wasn't. It took to long to get started. There were some annoying dialogues. The effects are what kept me in the cinema, but, great effects don't make a great film.My friend and I nearly left the cinema, and at many times, a lot of other people watching it were getting annoyed at how slow it really was. I think the main thing that annoyed me was who they were actually trying to 'incept'. Just didn't seem like a very important figure. 'Incepting' the president or someone like that could have been much more entertaining:0Sorry Mr Nolan, but next time tell the story properly:) J",0
"I had the misfortune of choosing to squander both time and money on seeing this turgid, overblown, and overrated mess at the cinemas upon its release. Now, I don't mind some of Christopher Nolan's movies. The first I ever saw was 'Memento' shortly after its home release on DVD. I recalling really enjoying and liking that movie. I haven't seen it in a while, so it's probably due another viewing. I think his oeuvre is pretty good, but nowhere near as good as his fan base would have you believe. He has some good films ('Memento', 'Insomnia', 'Batman/Dark Knight Trilogy' - haven't seen 'Dunkirk' so cannot yet comment), some okay films ('The Prestige', 'Interstellar' - sorry, I just can't get on board for that so called space 'epic' - it has moments of greatness, but plenty of drek too), and then there's 'Inception' - which is in a league of its own; one so far down, one has yet to be invented for it. Anyway, it really is just a total mess. Yeah, I know, it's a movie about dreams. And some wise-guy will probably be thinking or saying, ""But, that's exactly what dreams are like; they're messy!"". So yeah, maybe Nolan was clever enough to have the entire premise of the movie excuse how convoluted and nonsensical the entire plot is, because you know, that's how dreams work, stupid! Except, if wanted this sort of messy entertainment free of charge (and with some actual mental benefits) then I'd have just taken a nap instead of going to watch 'Inception'. Now, I won't spoil the movie here, because to be frank, Nolan did a pretty good job of that all on his own. Obviously he thought he could pass off a load of claptrap as genius (lapped up without much resistance by his fan base and other easily satisfied punters) because of aforementioned dream-state premise of the story. But there are other issues here as well. Like, a total absence of character development, decent script, or even passable action sequences, or pacing. There was one critic at the time of its cinematic release, whose name I don't recall, but who perfectly encapsulated 'Inception' in a nutshell, by penning something along the lines of, ""Inception may be directed by Christopher Nolan; but it would appear that Nolan's dreams are directed by Michael Bay"". Oooommph!!! There's a metaphor to describe that very telling remark, but all I remember is it has something to with hitting the head of a nail. Watch 'Inception' at your peril, but preferably with concrete spectacles and ear plugs.",0
"This is the kind of movie designed to make really stupid people feel smart.""Inception"" continues Christopher Nolan's steep decline after the riveting ""Following"" and the clever ""Memento."" There's a germ of a good idea here. (In fact, there are germs of 9 good ideas here. But they are all poorly thought-through and badly realized.Nolan draws on Orpheus (DiCaprio) trying to save his doomed wife (Cotillard) from Hades (here: Limbo.) There's Ariadne (Page) who helps Theseus (DiCaprio again) thread through the maze of the Minotaur. There are riffs on Jung's archetypal projections and Freud's ""unconscious"" blah blah blah as if Nolan opened up a book by Joseph Campbell, sprinkled in some ""psychological ops"" nonsense...and said ""I am BRILLIANT!"" Well, Nolan started with great ingredients. But they're all poorly mixed, half-baked and layered precariously on top of one another.Bottom line: this is a truly dreadful film which will be hailed by people -- who because they're confused -- will think it's JENIUS! The only good thing? I finally understand how Scientology caught on.",0
"Whilst this film has an amazing cast and is obviously directed by one of the most creative directors out there (Christopher Nolan) for me this film was simply made for the main purpose to make me feel smarter than I actually am. I am not the smartest person in the world I am just a 16 year old male who has missed 2 years of education but even I could tell what was happening in every scene even though it was pulled off in a way to make you feel smarter so that gives it 5 points because that's fairly creative to an extent, but it's really just not my thing and I didn't find it memorable at all unlike his other films like the dark knight trilogy and memento. (actual masterpieces) I suppose if this is your type of film I would recommend it for you it's certainly not bad just in my humble opinion overrated and just an average film.",0
"I have seen many great movies and i have seen this movie, but it was not up to my standards. The plot was a little confusing (when i say a little, i mean a lot) but on the lighter side the fight scenes were good so were the actors that participated like Leonardo DiCaprio (really awesome actor he was in Blood Diamond, and of course Titanic)there was also Pete Postlethwaite (who died recently, you would of seen him in Jurassic Park and The Usual Suspects)that is not all Michael Caine got a role in this movie and i am sure everyone knows of his work. 3/10. (-7/10 because of the plot) I recommend you still watch it no matter what i said, or what other people said because everybody has there own opinions. Kind regards, ben-james300",0
"(Not sure if this is considered to contain spoilers, so I checked the box. Read at your own risk.)First of all, I'd like to thank all those who wrote the 1-star reviews. The ones I read were hilarious! Thanks for the laughs, and I mean that! Secondly, my review is that the movie isn't so awful if accompanied by several Cosmos and you only paid six dollars for the ticket. If only I'd remembered to bring a Snuggie. And hadn't eaten so many mini-corndogs. Plus popcorn. Let's just say I did not dream too well last night.**Comes back after Preview.** What? I have to write ten lines? OK. I think I have discovered part of the problem. One must create something based only on length, not necessarily content, thus, the inception of Inception, to wit: Movie studio: This screenplay will only compute into a movie that lasts fifty-seven minutes. Screenwriter: Uh, really? OK. So I need to add something. I know! I'll make it a dream within a dream. Movie studio: At one hour, 23 minutes, it's still not long enough. People won't think they got their money's worth. Screenwriter: OK, how about a dream within a dream within a dream. Movie studio: By George, I think you're on the right track! And with Leo and Caine, we will rule the Academy! Don't give Caine too many lines, though, he'll want more money. Screenwriter: Gotcha.",0
"This movie has come to the cinemas as THE blockbuster. It is somehow nice to watch and the staff is top notch but, oh, it is such a pity that this is it. The idea behind the plot is old (Freud would have had a lot to say about the director) Trying to connect the idea of multiple levels of subconsciousness with special effects etc to satisfy the today's everyday cineaste's desire for watching a utilisation of whatever is possible with the right equipment makes it an ""innovative movie"".Considering the exhaustive explanations about how it works and why we need an architect and how we are going to jump to the other level and why the hell killing myself in the second level just does not wake me up but leaves me in the limbo...does anyone of you have to be killed in your dream so that you wake up? Who remembers their dreams in such a detailed way? Who imagines entire cities including pedestrians, traffic, side streets and a weather so awful just because you drank too much water before you went to bed? did anyone of you think while watching the movie, did anyone think: yes, this may really be a dream, and it makes me want to dive into a deep conversation with my neighbour about my existence as a projection of the real me that is actually caught in the third level of last Friday night's dream? When I watched the movie, the different dream levels simply reminded me of the Hollywood director's desire for pushing as many stories and sceneries and action elements in a movie as possible but yet trying to satisfy his own independent movie director's desire to link the whole thing to a sophisticated and intellectually stimulating plot. But I would imagine (choice of words is twisted I know but it is not my mother tongue!)that dreams can somehow be differentiated from reality, and, except for the dead wife reappearing on every level, they just put some simple hotel lounges and james bond like snow castles onto the screen. And, oh, the characters...Cobb is the only one with a background story. The others seem like extras needed to somehow push a little sense into the storyline. Or needed to point out the senseless subconscious craziness: a dreamscape fully designed and thought through by a prospective architect as a playground for the extractor who seems to end up in the Limbo where he finally finds the 'real projection' of his wife Yes, it may have made people think about what is real, what is just imagination...and those who missed the first introductory part of the movie may have been confused when it came to the dream within the dream within the dream and the roundhouse kick as a wake up call. but it was still these people who left the cinema and said: well I am not sure if I understood everything, but this movie was awesome!! I think a difference to Memento, which I found awesome, is that the world of Inception is just ridiculously overblown of intellectually touched ambition, it is a movie that is superficially insightful but is in fact just not worth it to think about. You try so hard to concentrate and not to fall asleep when it comes to the 53rd level of subconsciousness. And there is no surprising and elucidating moment, that a good movie needs, just a little bit of complexity to catch up with.",0
"First of all, I pretty much figured out how this movie was going to end the second it started. While the ending does make you think, it's a very, very obvious plot twist. The movie also doesn't follow its own rules. The characters say that they always wake up when there is a ""kick"" or the feeling of falling and hitting something, yet this happens numerous times in the fight scenes and chase scenes and none of the characters wake up. The best examples of this are the van flipping through midair and crashing on the street, the avalanche, and the guy falling off the fortress. While I thought that it was exciting and well made and that the actors were dead on, this movie really doesn't live up to all the hype. Watch the Prestige. THAT is a masterpiece.",0
"I am not giving this a bad review for any other reason than because it absolutely sucked.... Would have rather watched the Book of Eli than this...I went into the movie theater with an open, clear mind, ready to watch Inception. Well, let me tell you I was let down. The movie did not keep me interested the least bit. There was too much time for people to babble on screen and I felt the chemistry between the characters were lacking. The action scenes were even mediocre... I mean common, how could the CGI and action be so bad coming from the director of Dark Knight? I'll tell you why, it's because he can't top his last work and I am sure he won't be able to with any other movie he directs. The things the movie business will do to get our money... The whole idea of the dream world was cool but, It could have been taken even farther. There were so many scenes where I was just saying, ""Well, that doesn't convince me because of this flop, or this mess up the director failed to notice. Leo did an o.k job in the movie but i swear, it was just lacking something.... Oh yes, entertainment!!!I suggest going to see Despicable Me or Predators (rather Predators) because this movie is a flop. Wait until this comes out in your nearest dollar theaters.On an ending note, I saw this on opening day and half of the people in the theater were booing at the end a couple walked out during the movie.",0
"I didn't want to do this but after seeing the results at the IMDb's top 250 movies, with Inception at #3! I snapped... UPDATE: it was #3 at the time I reviewed this film upon its release.Let me start off by saying that I wasn't really that interested in seeing Inception. With every trailer I saw i had no idea what the movie was about. It all seemed to me like a high concept film with not much of a story. In essence, I was pretty accurate about my pre-notions. Although I think high concept ideas should stick to music videos, video essays, and video ads, etc...I'm not against high concept ideas on film. There were very good films with complex ideas that were actually done very well (i.e. Memento, Eternal Sunshine...). But it wasn't the concept that made them great movies, it was the story. In Memento we're sympathizing with the character and captured by what's going on because we're trying to find out who he thinks murdered his wife. In Eternal Sunshine we're carried into Joel's mind as he realizes his love interest erases him from his memory! But this film, as much as it begged us to, seemed to fail at demonstrating anything remotely as captivating.I have to give credit to Nolan for translating the engineering of his imagination to moving images. I know there's layers and layers of content we won't notice until the 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th viewing.-heck it took him 10 years to write it! We better not get it all in the first viewing! But it all comes at the cost of what storytelling is all about: STORY TELLING. Hey listen, I got it, OK. Even if I wasn't smart enough to figure out what was going on myself I would've had Nolan explaining it through dialogue anyway... but did I care? I really wished I did! I really wanted to care that Cobb got to see his kids again, but I didn't feel Nolan persuaded me enough to! That for me was it's biggest flaw. I could've hated the main character or I could've loved him, and I would've been satisfied. But if I have no regard for the main character, as far as I'm concerned, you have failed me; no brilliant concept or tip-top VFX could replace that. *SPOILER* And for some reason manipulating one billionaire's decision (Fischer) causing him to not be one anymore in order to benefit another billionaire (Saito) didn't move me nearly as much as the animated singing piece of turd did on South Park. hi-dee-ho!In summary, it's entertaining for the audiences that are amused by stories overlooked by visual FX, strenuous, complicated multi-layered concepts produced by directors who make comic book movies. *shrugs*p.s. there's another movie I'd rather watch where Leo struggles with reality. As good as he is, Nolan's still has lots to learn.",0
"Gross defects: 1) I can't hear the dialogs. Sound effects and background music are markedly louder than dialogs. This is a gross technical deficiency. You need to rise the volume way too high to obtain audible speech. That's probably alright if you are in a theater, where loudness isn't a concern. Very few movies managed to have such a gross audio defect.2) Pompous digital video effects like cars exploding and firing guns are shamelessly unrealistic. Shot the gun: no recoil at all. Car explodes: only a fireball superimposed, not a glass broken, nor the car moves 1 inch. Seriously? Unpleasant plot and storytelling for the rest. IMHO.",0
"I guess there are some drawbacks in having been around when Matrix came out and remembering the revolution it stirred up. Since then i inevitably think about it when a movie tries to tackle the boundaries of reality. In this sense, the best thing about Inception is that it came out more than a decade after Matrix, thus allowing the critical mass of new viewers to grow up and embrace it without much prior knowledge of cinema.Similar to other Christopher Nolan movies, there is little you can complain about in terms of ""fun factor"", production qualities or actors' performance. But the problems arise when we descend to a deeper level where ""big topics"" are supposedly to be discussed. There we encounter a storyline and arguments resembling a background scenario of a superior first-person video game. In fact, when you ponder about it, there is little to Inception apart from visual experience, which is the norm for blockbusters with high ratings on IMDb.",0
"""Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex does not make it cool."" -Stan MarshI would have to agree. Though this movie is visually appealing, the many twists and turns make it difficult to watch without getting a headache. It is a cool movie, entertaining at the least, but I don't get what the big hype is. Just another run of the mill action movie...But the acting was excellent and it had a very cool soundtrack, might be worth some peoples time, but in my opinion Nolan is nothing more than a less dull version of Michael bay. the only reason i say that is because there is at least an original plot, but an overly convoluted one that got everyone worked up. There are much better plots by more stylized and sophisticated directors that convey themes and messages much better through simplicity.",0
"Wow! Talk about a multi-layered muddle of a potentially fascinating idea... Like, who was controlling whose dream here? First off, there seems to be some real confusion with Inception about what a dream is and what a hallucination is (especially as massive one).And, yes, I know that the meaning of these two words (that's ""dream"" & ""hallucination"") do overlap one another and depending on the context in which these words are used they actually might be regarded as synonyms of each other.... (Hey! Am I splitting hairs here?) But, with that said, I personally regard what the characters in this film witnessed (while in an apparent subconscious state) were strictly hallucinations and not dreams (at least not dreams in the strictest sense of the word).Uh.... Are you confused yet? - Well, I am! And, sorry, but that's all that Inception succeeded in doing - Causing major, or should I say, ""massive"" confusion.The way I see it (confused as I am), just because Inception's story dealt with so-called dreams and the deeper levels of the subconscious mind, that didn't automatically make it an intelligent story aimed at an actual thinking person.But, hey, maybe (just maybe) I somehow completely missed Inception's intellectual cleverness altogether, because, due to this film's unforgivable 2.5-hour running time, I found myself being repeatedly distracted by really trivial things outside the realm of paying attention to what was taking place on the picture screen.From my frustrated and disappointed perspective of Inception I'd say that I could easily sum up its story in 3 very simple words - And those 3 little words are - Blah! Blah! Blah! Believe me, I was hoping for so much more from this movie, but, time and again, it fell mighty short of its potential and its expectations.Anyways - Not only did I find Leonardo DiCaprio to be an incredibly insincere and drab actor who scrapes the absolute bottom of the barrel with the likes of that doofus Ryan Gosling.....And, not only did I find, to my sheer annoyance, that every interior scene was shot, for some inexplicable reason, in low-wattage lighting where infuriating shadows literally washed everything worth seeing out of view.....But, Cobb's utterly ridiculous and demented obsession with his dead wife, Mal, and her repeatedly showing up in one dream/hallucination after another (ho-hum!), bogged Inception's already floundering story down like an incredibly heavy, lead weight had been tied around its neck to the point of causing near-suffocation, followed by the total strangulation of any free-thinking ideas and concepts.And, finally - Here's my brief take on director, Christopher Nolan - This guy is a real master of confusion. With each new movie that he directs the plots have become noticeably more and more incoherent, haywire and disjointed. And, with that, his characters have become less and less likable.P.S. - What really shocked, amazed and puzzled me the most about Inception was that it didn't deliver the much-anticipated surprise/twist ending that I was expecting as its way of rounding off all of the confusion that prevailed. This film's finale was so frickin' limp-wristed that all it did was suck to the 10th power.SO, WAKE UP, EVERYONE, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE TO WAKE UP AT ALL!!",0
"I love a twist, sci-fi and some fancy photography. I was therefore really excited by the prospect of this movie on the big screen. I am really disappointed to see this film so highly rated. I found it very predictable and for long periods boring - the point was highlighted in the cinema by the number of people who went out for a toilet break. Don't believe the hype - if this is in the top 20 films of all time then grease 2 must be sneaking into the top 10. The concept is fine - the acting is fine, but it is nothing new. Just look towards any other within the same genre to see equivalent movies receiving scores far lower; even the mundane matrix is worthy of a higher score. If cgi is what you are after then fine - but it isn't even the best at that. I'm not getting angry thinking about it! Get a life and shame on those of you who score it so highly - watch more films!",0
"You will definitely change your ratings and your opinions of this movie once you will get to watch Paprika (2006) by Satoshi Kon the real master mind behind the idea.Christopher Nolan just made some 2 or 3 changes in the movie but it made the movie worst.Please Watch Paprika if you think Inception was movie worth watching it will definitely make you think again when rate movie above 7.The lift scenes , dream collapsing, merging of dreams with reality.... and all other stuff which made you think its a clever piece of cinema well its just happens to be completely a rip off from Japanese anime movie paprika just check it out yourself.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851578/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1",0
"Am I missing out on something? When i watched this movie, I nearly fell asleep half way through. Once again, Christopher Nolan attempts a clever, slick, convoluted film and only succeeds in boring the watcher. The story is completely unbelievable and it takes about half the movie to explain the plot. Sorry, not worth it. There are a few good ideas and clever camera work, but the script just drags and drags. Granted, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good, Ellen page is good, Leonardo DiCaprio is average and Cillian Murphy is solid, but none of them are really able to enliven a slow moving script. By the time it got to the end, I didn't really care whether the damn thing fell or didn't. Sadly, this movie allowed me to dream far too much as DiCaprio tried to permeate my sleep. Very disappointing. Definitely not living up to the hype.",0
"So you add 2 teaspoon of Matrix, 1 teaspoon of Mission Impossible and a drop of Shutter Island/Fight Club and you cook with healthy dose of 2012 doomsday CGI.... and serve Inception.Of course, it helps if people have got used to the concept of alternate reality and the correlation of dreams, human psyche is as old as the stones. Sedation, sub-conscious, post hypnotic suggestions are theories that have been in vogue since 1950s.But still you need cook a good stew and surprisingly Inception is a very good one-time serve, specially since the top kept spinning or was it about to stop?",0
"Briefly, a high skilled ideas-thief has to implement an idea, a kind of order in fact, to a very powerful person, through dreams.To achieve this assignment, Cobb (Di Caprio) needs to use a special team and a high risked method. This is the pretext for providing many actions, many explosions. So many that it knock you down, and I nearly fell asleep ... which is not a good sign ! I would have expected a more calm, more reflexion-focused storyboard. The cast is OK but I would not have chosen Di Caprio for the main role. He acts good but I don't see him as a ideas-thief. For this kind of scientific mission, I would have imagined someone more geeky, more cerebral. Happily, and as usual with Nolan, the visual is fantastic. Majestic, polished : impressive. This saves the film and makes it something watchable but not more. I review this film now because I'm afraid to forget it quickly !",0
"Just one advice ! - Keep AWAY from this nightmare ! 2.5 hours of boring, boring and once more boring thing (cannot even call it a movie). Stupid idea, veeeery slow action and absolutely nothing new what we haven't seen before. I do not understand why Leonardo Di Caprio who used to be for me some kind of guarantee of a good fun decided to take a part in this disaster. The same about Michael Caine. And one more thing - music: the most disturbing and annoying movie soundtrack I ever listened to... they should be returning money for tickets !",0
The plot was so convoluted that half the audience were scratching their heads and whispering to each other trying to figure it out. Several people walked out early but we stuck it out nearly to the hour and a half mark before we had to leave. Worst movie I've seen in many years and I go nearly every weekend. The only people who would like this movie are drama majors who enjoy debating the deep meaning of every scene over their cappuccinos and scones. There were several lines that were mumbled and the sound was handled so poorly that you couldn't hear what the character was saying. The constant background music was overpowering and eventually gave me a headache. If you love movies skip this one and go see The Sorcerer's Apprentice - much more entertaining.,0
Was looking forward to watching this because of the ratings. What a disappointment. Story was weak and poorly told generating little commitment to the characters. Shame......,0
"Extremely conplicated plot, with forgettable characters and performances. Next.....",0
"This is indeed C. Nolan's movie which I liked least among all I watched. And I watched all his Batman movies, and was not impressed, except with Begins.
Surely very high budget, impressive cast, and I actually like all them, but this was simply too pretentious, and full with scenes which actually had nothing with story flow.I even could not call this sci-fi, because whole idea of multiplied time-flow speed in dreams in dream(s) is simply impossible, and is too much even for Hollywood, who does not care much for some scientific accuracy.Add to it length of some 2.5 hours, while whole story is not complex at all. After some years, I basically don't remember almost anything except main part of plot, and that silly scene of shooting on street, what was so utterly pointless.Still, I will not rate it with 1-2, as many did here, because visually it looks very well, direction is good most part. Acting too.Could be most overrated movie ever ...",0
"The director seems to think he is above the viewer. Trying to explode the viewers mind, his simple ploy however fools No one. While watching and eating my salsa popcorn my mind was drifting and I realized this movie has no plot.What an utter shame, another high budget movie leaving me bewildered in disappointment. However I enjoyed my salsa popcorn so I will give it a 2.",0
"OK, it's a movie with huge production values and a great cast and all that stuff. Beside those attributes, I found the movie too premise based and too math like. It felt similar to a time travel premise movie, where the buy in is important for the story (Memento). I didn't buy in. The talk and concept of different levels of dream states and manipulating the subconscious patterns of the dreamer seemed too formulaic and, even, immature. Keep in mind, I'm writing this review a few years after seeing the movie. It was one of those films where I had to go out and see another movie to correct the experience and to remove the disappointment from my mind. Good luck.",0
"To begin with, let me inform that Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors as 2 of my favorite movies (The Dark Knight and The Prestige) are the work of the genius.Expectations were very high. However below are the points which i would like to highlight: The Good: The sets were beautiful. The concept seems something new The bad: 1- PACE: Thts the first thing that defines a good or bad movie for movie.I got bored within 20 minutes.The screenplay wasn't convincing enough to keep me glued to the screen for 2 hours and 30 minutes.2- Trying to be over-complex: I feel Nolan tried his best to make this movie as complex as possible. It was unnecessarily stretched for 2 hours adding layers after layers. I don't understand why someone would like to watch this movie twice to get the point.Why should one care if at the end he was dreaming or not? 3- I felt that the shots that were shown in snow were unnecessarily and could have been avoided.final Verdict: Highly over hyped as i don't understand what people liked about this movie as when i ask people who have given high ratings to this movie about the story they have nothing much to say.Give it miss. Not recommended",0
"The 5 that I gave it were purely for the conception of the premise and the effort and hours that went into trying to convey it on film. However, never, ever, have I seen a film that is so highly rated by others, but which has zero character development or depth. ZERO! We're supposed to believe that Ellen Page's character - whatever her name was - meets Cobb one day and the very next day she is willing to risk her life to help him on his job? And from whence hails this bond that makes her so obliged to go along with them so that she can save them all from Cobb's dead wife? From where does this allegiance stem? There is no bond. There is no background. There is no character development. Ditto with Cobb's dad. Why did he only resist for oh, three seconds, before handing over a student? No conflict and no resolution - just, oh, well, here ya go. And as for Cobb, is he meant to be a sympathetic anti-hero? Because I could give two hoots if that man ever gets home to his kids. I never felt any allegiance to him. I never rooted for him. I sort of wanted him to die. All of this made the film ultimately uninteresting for me. If you do not have any compunction to care about the characters, then how can you care about their actions? How can you care about the film? You can't. The only slightly redeeming quality other than the premise was the brilliant Eams. Excellent. Superb. And totally hot. And with him, there was no need for character advancement because it was clear that he simply was the equivalent of a mercenary. A gun (forger) for hire, who also got quite a thrill from it. But he does it so stylishly that for his fate, I did worry, as he was the only quality that for me, save this film from being dire.",0
"I would have walked out of this film 30 minutes into it, if I went alone to the theater. Anyway, to sum it up: This film was a torture to sit through. Do the directors think that every audience member has an attention deficit disorder? The film tried SO hard to blast the audience away with special effects and quick editing every other 5 seconds that it forgot a storyline. Leading to my point, what the was the film about? I still have no idea, nor do I care to know. It was a confusing mess. And I could care less about any character in the film either. I was actually hoping to fall asleep in the film because it would have been a better well spent two hour dream than this nightmare of a film! But all the noise of the film wound up giving me nothing but a headache. They should have a discount for an aspirin on the back of the ticket because you will need one after seeing this film. For a real sci-fi film that is completely brilliant and moving, go rent MOON (2009). MOON only had a budget of 3 million, with only one person starring in the whole film, and it had more beauty in it than this inception disaster could ever dream about.",0
"Somehow I knew when I checked IMDb this movie would get a ridiculous rating, and sure enough... This movie is silly, tedious and way too convoluted for its own good. Not entertaining and mainly an exercise for the director to say ""Look how clever I am! I can throw in twists upon twists!"" The actors were uniformly dull, and no one stood out. The story line was well, just forget it, its not worth going into.""Memento"" by the same director is far superior to this mess. This movie isn't even in the same league as that. Also, the movie was too long, I was praying for it to end several times but it just kept going. It was a relief when the movie finally ended. I can't stand movies that wear out their welcome, and this movie should have been cut to 90 minutes.I'll give it a 5 just because it was an intelligent movie, but that is about all it had going for it.",0
The universe set by this movie is OK. The technology used isn't explained... lame. The story is plain and not interesting. The movie drags on way to long in boring not so much important it could have been faster convo's. The movie length is just that long because of the long slow conversations and slow motions.But what gets annoying is they don't apply the logic they set in the rules. 1. Tip over you come back out (car flipping over is tipping over). 2. Weightless only works on one dream but doesn't apply magically to another. (Winter Wonder Land has its own gravity i guess)Overall this movie is a waste of time and certainly not re-watchable.Rating of 2 because the non-standard Hollywood movie with new ideas was kinda nice.,0
"This movie is about dreams in a sense that the main characters have the ability to dream on demand, and enter other peoples' dreams. I have always been fascinated by dreams; the difference in the perception of time in dream space; the effects of the physical changes occurring in the dreamer's reality to the events in his or her dream. I was excited towards the beginning of the film where the main characters are shown to explore and build dream worlds. The plot which follows is too complicated to be enjoyed. It is a pretty good plot with very few loose ends, but I felt that the filmmakers could have made a more fantastic a more rich experience when it comes to the dream worlds shown in the film. I would rate Shutter Island, which is similar in the sense that it deals with the imaginative powers of the mind and its effects, a lot higher. Or a film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where thoughts and memories and the wanderings of the mind are depicted in so touching a manner. Inception has gunmen and hand grenade launchers, fast car chases and action...things which were not completely necessary for the plot to seem effective. I felt that the film could have made use of the creative license that dreams gives it, in a far more effective way. Also, Dreaming Is a Private Thing. Sharing dreams is a definite no no :). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_Is_a_Private_Thing",0
"No. I could not help but think while I was watching this movie that others in the audience were being challenged with the plot more than me. An applause for the movie at the end simply stunned me. I believe that this movie was made for a 13 year old's intellect and if you are surprised what is going on in the movie you just didn't get it or something.This is definitely the worst Di Caprio film I have seen (in a while. ever?), which sucks because I thought his acting in this movie was very good. The predictability of this movie was just too much for me. It was something mixing the idea of a world within a world(i.e., Matrix etc...)and the ridiculousness of a movie like ""National Treasure 2."" I suspended disbelief for this movie, but the plot was just extremely transparent and unoriginal to me. There was too much worthless talk in between action scenes, giving you too much information( A little less talk and a lot more action)...I guess it will be hard for me to fight the 9.6/10 IMDb currently rates this movie at, but I had to get this out there.",0
"The only reason I had not to stand up and leave was Joseph Gordon-Levitt, because my boots are made for walking. But his part, unfortunately, is neither long nor developed. Lukas Haas disappears in the beginning, which is also a waste of talent. Instead, we see Leonardo DiCaprio, just as he always is : not bad, not good. Ellen Page, here an actress in limbo. Cilian Murphy, in a character also unexploited. And Marion Cotillard in repeated appearances : love, murder, suicide. All the actors seem to think: ""dont't be harsh, I know I am acting in a silly movie; I just do my best not to show."" Alas! their idea of a nightmare goes to our consciousness (without stealing), and stays. The directing is nonexistent.Too bad, I did not fall asleep on my chair, for maybe I would have woken up from this nightmare. The plot is of no interest : if you accept the stupid premises of those scientific dreams, you guess very quickly who will die and who will survive. Waiting for the end, 2 hours and a half are ten years long. The special effects are rather well done: they don't know they act in a mess, but the editing is loose in between.Do not waste your time : take a good nap instead.",0
"Comparing this movie to The Matrix is an insult to the Matrix, the directors of the Matrix, and basically anyone who had anything to do with the production of the Matrix.This movie has an interesting premise, but I was not a fan of the storytelling style. Yes the movie had multiple things going on at once later in the movie, but I felt the movie was insulting my intelligence by reminding me what was happening in each scene every 5 minutes and cutting back to them, like I get what is going on, keep on with the main movie. The movie spends 30 minutes with scenes that are just to confuse, only to explain them in about 30 seconds later in the movie. I was bored to death in this movie, and I am a scifi fan. I am not qualified really to comment on the acting, but I thought it was pretty good. The whole time, it seemed like the movie thought it was some type of epic, but it really was too long, uninteresting, and slow moving.This movie fails. It is too slow and simplistic for a scifi fan to enjoy, and too complicated for a good percentage of people (my dad) to understand.Also the last 30 minutes of the movie should have been cut. There are only a few memorable scenes/quotes in the movie.I made an account here to let you guys know with this tough economical time, SAVE YOUR MONEY, this movie does not live up to the hype, and I cannot believe some of the reviews praising it.I may seem like a hater, but if you don't believe me on how bad it is, go waste 10 dollars and two and a half hours of your life and you will be in the same boat as me, someone who hated this movie.",0
"It is rumored that Christopher Nolan took eight years to complete this story, his first original work in over a decade. Perhaps he just needed a little more time.It doesn't surprise me that Nolan, the guilty party behind Memento, would come up with a movie where gratuitously Byzantine convolution is served up instead of anything resembling story. What does surprise me is that Nolan manages, eventually, to steer this vehicle to a reasonably satisfying conclusion. And it is for the sake of the marginally effective dénouement alone that I am willing to forgive a movie for having a blatantly video game structure, complete with levels and avatars and an artificially aggressive ticking clock to manufacture urgency.I suppose one could carp about the fact that Ellen Page as Ariadne goes from badly dressed student to the Yoda of shared dreaming quite literally in the blink of an eye, but that would be complaining about the table service when the restaurant is on fire. Perhaps the biggest failing of the writing in Inception is that all the characters are forced to deliver lengthy, tedious expository dialogue to explain what just happened, what is currently happening, or what is about to happen. Without giving too much away, this probably explains why, in the second act, Nolan has the wrong character delivering a speech. Basically, there are the main characters in a dream and then there are projections created by the characters. In one scene, a key plot element is explained by a projection, who would have no knowledge of the element, instead of the character, who is there to introduce it. It's an amateurish blunder that shows what happens when bad writers get in over their heads.This basic story itself was done decades ago with far more finesse and wit in everything from Dreamscape to American Werewolf in London. In fact, the whole plot, if you can call it that, is as convincingly fresh as yesterday's dry toast. It's The Matrix meets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, who then get hijacked by Total Recall while Memento and Dark City stand back and laugh on the sidelines. It's as if Nolan wanted to outdo all of them by forcing them into a single mashed up meta-story.So why watch this movie? I guess it all comes down to this _ the movie, quite simply, is fun to watch. Lots of fun.What Nolan lacks as a writer, and the list is long, he more than makes up for as a director. Inception is taut and energetic from start to finish. Even though the characters are ridiculously flat, they move effortlessly through Nolan's heightened reality. Inception may not be the best story literarily, but Nolan's way of telling it cinematically is superb.In short, the story revolves around a team of people, scientist, spies, we're never really sure, who have perfected a way of entering other people's dreams. Once inside, they use the warped reality of dreams to extract secrets from the dreamer.Apparently there are numerous rules regarding dream intervention. Violating them leads to dire consequences. Mercifully, the old saw that if you die in a dream you die in real life is not true here. It just wakes you up. Usually.But along comes the mission to use the dream to implant an idea in the dreamer _ Inception. Apparently this is difficult, but, of course, it must be done. Fortunately, it seems that the whole world is up on the dream-jacking process, and experts abound. It's even so commonplace that ordinary citizens go to seminars on how to fight back in their dreams, making them formidable foes in dreamland. So a new team is assembled and the game, as in video game, is on, and on, and on.Suffice it to say that, in typical Nolan fashion, the story revolves around itself until it generates a tasty little paradox, within which the (almost) redeeming moments of the film reside. Ersatz intellectuals are already asking the central question of the film as proof of their depth, a sort of ""Who is John Galt?"" meta-meme. Unfortunately, Ayn Rand was such a pedantic, didactic writer I ended up not caring who John Galt was. In similar fashion, after Nolan has drummed away at his central issue for so long it grew tedious, I walked away from this movie not caring about the answer to ""The Question.""I'd say, reel in your expectations a tad, then go see the movie and have fun.",0
"Now we know what to do when we do not have a story but a bunch of bucks to make a movie: simply throw in some action, get Hans Zimmer in and make a whole lot of marketing efforts to get all of us dummies in summertime in the theaters and here you have Inception. What simply gets enormously annoying in the movie: every time you have the impression that the storyline is in a ""dream"", it seems that is a dream within a dream, and than that dream within the dream is in a dream...come on...!! Leanordo Di Caprio is splendid as always, the female co-actors are too dull for words. 2 stars for the action elements, 2 stars for Hans Zimmer and 1 for the effort,but no more, no more!",0
"Christopher Nolan's follow-up to 2008's megahit The Dark Knight was rumored as many different films that had been seen by no one. ""This film is revolutionary!"" ""It sucks!"" ""It's dumb and pointless!"" ""It's amazing!"" And having finally seen Inception, without many expectations, I can tell you that if you were to see one film, for the remainder of the summer, you should make it Inception.Inception has a lot going for it. Its cast works wonders, because every actor brings something fresh and new to the table. It never feels outdated, or irrelevant. It's original without being idiotic. It's intelligent without being implausible. It doesn't take its extremely layered plot too seriously, and there's one thing that really separates it from any other summer action flick: It requires a great deal of thought. You don't know where it's going next. Once it pulls you into its clutches, it takes you on a ride that is unlike anything you've seen on screen in years. Its ending will be debated, analyzed and picked apart by many film snobs across the world, and it's a film that doesn't just deserve, but requires multiple viewings. It's a hell of a lot to take in at once.Now, in any film review, a reader would like to know what the piece is about. This one's plot is better left unsaid, because the first viewing is enough to leave the audience in utter awe. However, I'll do my best to at least give you an idea.Leonardo DiCaprio outshines any of his previous works, playing Dom Cobb, a thief who is proficient in extraction (going into a subject's mind, during dreams, and stealing their ideas, and using them against them), who is embarking on one final job before he can retire, and go home for good. Instead of stealing a subjects dream, he and his team decide to do the opposite. Not to steal a dream, but to go into a person's subconscious and plant an idea. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, of (500) Days Of Summer fame, and Ellen Page, of Juno fame, Marion Cotillard, of Nine and La Vie En Rose greatness, Ken Watanabe, of The Last Samurai, Cillian Murphy, of indie film fame, and a few legends (Michael Caine and Tom Berenger) are the heart of this film. There is truly great acting all around. Everybody brings something new to the table. Each character is richly detailed, and multi-layered. Nobody is really who they say they are. Gordon-Levitt, Page and Cotillard are a few of my favorite actors of the current generation, who haven't had their ""big breaks"" quite yet. They've had a few parts that they're semi-well known for, and this film is a fabulous transition into mainstream cinema. That's because this is an art-house film that is financed by a major studio. That's the beauty of it. Insight, intelligence and uncanny originality are things you don't see in movies anymore. It's a breath of fresh air to see something as unique and interesting as this.But, at the end of the day, it's Christopher Nolan's genius ideas, smart script, elegant direction, and masterful artistry that make this picture what it is. This is a film that I could picture the writer-director losing his mind over. It's his story, it's his game. He invents a world that you've never seen in any type of film before. It's reminiscent of The Matrix, and the early James Bond pictures. It creates its own metropolis, and its own rules. It breaks the rules of conventional American cinema. And thank god for that. Inception is one of the best films so far in 2010.",0
"If this movie is actually an 8.8 (as of tonight) I'm Akira Kurosawa.The idea is interesting, yet simple: guy who usually steals ideas from others' minds gets hired to instead plant an idea in someone's mind. You could make a compelling movie out of that.What do we get instead? A tedious action movie with Bond-level stunts (not a compliment) with two other major problems:1. A Matryoshka Dolls narrative that gets irritating after about the third iteration, never mind the 13th.2. Dialogue that is such pseudo-science gibberish it's hard to believe anybody over the age of 14 is falling for it.A few other points. The Juno chick can't act. Ken Watanabe can't speak understandable English. The soundtrack is a by-the-numbers Feel This Emotion Now tone cliche.In sum, this movie tired me out within 45 minutes and I've sat spellbound through the 5-hour French version of Les Miserables from 1934.",0
"I dunno. I really want to like this movie. But a recent re-watch and I just can't!
But I have figured out why. OK, the premise and story line is a great idea to work with and I can see how it is supposed to grip you.But the characters are boring. I just didn't care about them or their motives. They didn't really seem care either is the thing. So I didn't want them to succeed or fail. So I lose interest.I hear the Leonardo is supposed to be a great actor. Again, I'm a little either way on this talent, but this wasn't his greatest moment .Visuals and ideas = great (for the 4 stars)
Characters and acting = 0",0
"I saw this when it came out in the cinemas because I love this sort of film but i was disappointed to find I hated it - deeply... but everyone I knew thought it was the bee's knees!
I recently watched it again to check that I hadn't missed something. Sometimes you have to give films a second chance - no - had the same response. Utter rubbish. But everyone else seemed to love it. I had to actually search these reviews to check I wasn't the only one on the planet who didn't think this was a masterpiece. I am relieved to see many views similar to mine. Utter rubbish - tries to ramp up the tension but the characters are completely unlikeable. Boring dreams - dull performances - really irritating noisey soundtrack that drowns our the dialogue. Terrible and overrated - never thought dreams could be so boring...zzzzzzzzzzzzz",0
"I may be able to count on one hand how many good to excellent movies I had zero questions about either during or after completion of the movie. Things do get by me and I try to get my answer from those who saw the flick with me, or online. Inception left me with one question. ""Did you get it?""I didn't get it and I've a high degree of confidence that those 100,453,830 people who 'got it', had 100,453,830 versions of 'gettin'. I've got 2 teenage kids and a 23 year old. My kids and every SINGLE one of their friends 'got it'. If you do not yet know where this review is going, you 'got it'. Nuff said. Pick up the emperor's clothes at the dry cleaners tomorrow. His majesty's clothes are ready and you ""Inception"" fans are ready for your close-up. ROLL 'EM!!!",0
"There's a lot of intellectual snobbery going on with fans of this movie. Everyone seems to think it's incredibly deep and crafted to intelligent audiences and that the only people who wouldn't like it are ""idiots who don't get it."" I understood it perfectly well and the idea of going into dreams is fantastic, but an idea doesn't make a movie. This movie failed to deliver a good plot, characterization, and most importantly the climax was one of the least interesting parts of the film! This film has all the ingredients to be great: Christopher Nolan, Leonardo Dicaprio, Ken Wantanabe... Unfortunately it ended up being more like a bad rip-off of the Matrix than something great.The idea behind this movie is that people can enter dreams simultaneously through some sort of unknown technology/methods. Great idea until you get into the details.Dreamers enter dreams are designed by ""the architects."" These ""maps"" were very ordinary places with the only exception being a few changes of gravity and a few extra special effects. My problem was that even if these dreams are designed, they are still dreams. The dreamers only addition is the ""projections"" which were all people who existed in the dreams. I don't know about Leonardo Dicapro and Chris Nolan, but my dreams contain numerous ""projections"" which are not only out of the ordinary, but often bizarre. The idea that somehow people are allowed to be created, but not anything else what so ever is pretty mindless.The movie really went downhill when you realize that the team is on a mission to go deep into the sub-conscious of a billionaire who is about to inherit his father's company. Their goal? to split his company apart. Why? To make one of the characters more powerful.The background story about the main characters life with his wife and the dream world he constructed with her is by far the best part of the movie. I' would have much rather watched a movie all about this then what Inception really was. The entire movie leads you to believe there the main character's story will somehow end up in a typical Nolan scene where something spectacular happens -it doesn't. The only thing that happens with his wife is exactly what you could have guessed as soon as you find out about why she acts the way she does.The movie ended one that ended up being more of a cheesy action film then something with substance. What a waste! This movie was still better than a lot of the junk that Hollywood puts out, but after seeing Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and the Dark Knight, I really expected more.",0
Saw the hype and the ratings and was looking forward to watching. Half way though I'm not engaged at all. The sound blasts out everything except the spoken word. It just didn't work for me.,0
Bloody Garbage Film Ever! Rubbish Make Me Fell Sleep And Boring! 1/10 Definitely,0

Paprika being an anime with more realized results .Some clever ideas ...some good actors .

"Concept is too nonsensical and illogical, how can someone have multiple dreams within a Dream?? The story of the movie is that, to plant an Idea in a CEO's mind, a group of People Dream within the dream, again dream within the second dream and within the second dream they dream third dream. Movie ending is ambiguous, it does not give the clarity if everything happened in real or in Dream . This is indeed one of the most overrated boring movie ever.",0
"Deception at Thirteenth Floor Inception- A brilliant story and more brilliantly shot.Christopher Nolan had this idea from the time of Matrix and The 13th floor and Dark city. They were based in the principles that the world around you might not be real. The Virtual world had some great examples of Labyrinths and Penrose stairs, limbo city which were very aesthetically shot.Sharing dreams, stealing ideas from dreams and more difficult- planting an idea was a real roller-coaster. The story was tightly wounded with loose ends which were tied again. The first half will keep your mind at a fast pace deciphering Nolan's idea about Dreams inside dreams inside dreams. The level of dreams were designed and grafted in a way that it looked real. However Second half nearing end was little stretched out. The extra extended level and their time dimensions were not mapped as correctly as it should be. Memento's Director had a clear set marked this time that the audiences are smarter this time.The Mombasa chase sequence was hand held but was impactful. The Matrix style of discussion about architecting dreams between Cobb and Ariadnae had some great camera graphics and was composed to bite nails. Cobb as lucid dreamer, the very first time he woke, after falling in water was critically too good and had no holes. The Zero gravity fight at second level Dream was a cult sequence, though second's to Neo's bullets in Matrix.From Deception to Inception of Dreams inside your minds was the plot of Heist to become the world's great Energy Company looked just satisfactory. The Employer of Cobb for the Last Job was not in clear, as Saito who Met Leo in the last scene was less convincing. When Saito said:-""You remind me of someone... a man I met in a half-remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical notions."" made an impact and the flashback movie became quite linear.Performance by Leonardo and Ellen Page was satisfactory, but Marion Cotillard as Mal was more convincing. She looked stunning and played a great spoilsport for Cobb's guilt inside his own dreams.Michael Caine and Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance was a stealer from Leonardo D Caprio.Nolan added a new dimension to the imagination. It was a mind boggling movie after Matrix and The 13th Floor. An event that is a beginning; a first part or stage of subsequent events is not only inception; But an Abrupt end which was very predictable from the beginning of the movie; proved Nolan's too literate and logical debate over virtuality. The Scene was cut when the top begins to wobble, leaving something for our dreams.5 for Nolan's Original dream and Reality.",0
"Inception was a deception big time. The movie was not emotionally engage. Not emotion at all. It was like a long trip going at 40 kph all the way. Over the top VFX and photosonics doing slow-mo like a shampoo commercial.The concept of having a dream, within a dream within a dream and then put an idea in somebody's head to change the future outcome, didn't excite me at all. Knowing his previous movies, I knew the movie will start at the end and let's go back to dig. Boring.Definitely his best movie to date is FOLLOWING.If you want to understand what it means an emotionally engage movie where you won't know until the end what is happening and without Hollywood explosions, watch ABRE LOS OJOS by Alejandro Amenabar.Since when a British filmmaker has emotions?",0
"I am amazed how many people ranked this one as a top choice.Interesting story, but the movie doesn't serve it.It lacks coherence, like for example either the writer or Nolan had some extended vacation during the writing/filming.Consider the entire snowy mountain sequence - 20-25 minutes long, and you never know what happens there. OK, there's an avalanche, but where is that, and where are the characters in relation to it? No, just an avalanche (even poorly made, like taken from a Discovery documentary or such). Also there's a lot of shooting out there, but you never know who's shooting at who (where are they in relation which each other).Also, the former wife is possibly the worst boogie(wo)man ever, and drops the movie down by her own.Di Caprio seemed to have had a vacation of his own. He seems rather absent, having a hard time trying to adjust to what happens. Perhaps the former wife had the most of him...On the other hand, you'll VERY MUCH like every sequence with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in it. Yes, even when he talks. I would suggest he should had been lead on this one, but I'm afraid the former wife would have had the most of him too...Superb music, and probably the only movie where music won't stop to change tune according to the movie scene, meaning the composer succeeded in finding tunes that fit whatever happens on the screen, even when the location, or the events as such, change, and that tune thusly can go as far as 8 minutes (sometimes a beautiful crescendo).When present, superb SFX, but they are rather rare.Even the ending is bad - by a long shot. Should had been the best, jaw- dropping, part of the movie, instead it's the worst (OK, except the snowy mountains sequence).",0
"I've heard the word visionary thrown Nolan's way, but this film was the work of a rather sterile imagination. Yes, it had a few layers of narrative cleverly interweaved with each other, but there was little to compel me at its core. The root cause of Cobb's state of mind just didn't grab me - partly as this relationship was never given the chance to develop to a tangible level. The elements of subconscious displayed were dull and the approach to the dreamworld rather banal - focusing as it did mainly on bland designs, bendy gimmicks and exploding things. There was little edge to Nolan's vision, he seemed quite happy to drown us in relentless exposition and unimaginative slow-mo shots. Scenes were very quick and at no point approached the atmosphere and intrigue of a real dream. A shame, because at their best, this is what films can do - engineer the quality of a waking dream. Compare Inception to the more intriguing work of Lynch, where scenes seduce with the perfect balance of the real and surreal, and whose images and ideas tend to linger in the mind. On top of this, Nolan is simply not a very good director of action; he is quite loose with the camera, and I yearned for more flair and invention in these scenes. Instead, he relied on an incredibly insistent score to give the action some punch. For a film about dreams and the subconscious, it was curiously impersonal and mechanical. Certainly, the real danger and sexuality of the subconscious might scare off mainstream audiences, but Nolan was given free reign to do what he wanted - so why not do something more interesting? The film is less concerned with psychology and more with the narrative possibilities afforded by a convoluted dreamworld fiction. Perhaps Nolan does dream of corporate worlds and Bond fortresses. Unfortunately, such things don't interest me.",0
"I am rather surprised to see so many positive - well, gushing - reviews for this movie. I found it almost outrageously derivative of both The Matrix and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Inception, to me, is an amalgam of the aforementioned two - with a dose of 'The Dirty Dozen' thrown in for good measure. Firstly I could not empathize with the main thrust of the plot: DiCaprio et al should risk their lives and sanity to help a billionaire meglomaniac to rule the world's energy supplies by ensuring his (the billionaire's) main rival breaks up his father's conglomerate gigantic energy-supply company. So there is no higher moral or ethical foundation to the plot or the struggles (and they are gargantuan!) of the characters. Which takes me to my second point - the characters are shadows, almost wafer thin - so again, as a viewer I don't really care too much about their plight. This is a serious drawback when they are almost constantly falling off cliffs, being burned etc etc. Only DiCaprio's character has any real depth, and even his character is derivative of so many lost souls 'trying to get home' movies. Third, while the action scenes are very impressive, with amazing special effects, the danger is so great at each moment - which they survive again and again - that all quickly becomes ludicrously contrived, and we never really doubt they'll survive. The bad guys are all clones and they are clearly useless at their jobs of protecting their paymasters. I was waiting for a 5th level of dream-depth, with the entire Chinese army on the attack .. that was the effect it all had on me. I left the cinema feeling quite disappointed - so much effort, so many effects, so much booming and crashing. Yet it counts for very little if the plot and characterizations are weak.",0
"I have just seen the most ridiculous ""movie"" ever made, and I use the term movie quite loosely. Is there no expectation any more that movies should have SOME plot, story, sequentiality, or plausibility, or are they just total indulgences on the part of the director? Rather than watching a compelling, evolving storyline that INVOLVES you and draws you in, instead we witness the work of 18 year-old computer whiz kids in front of their consoles, churning out meaningless, special effects displays. One feels like a bystander on the sidelines, and the experience of watching something like this is both boring and irritating. ""Inception"" is the most confused, convoluted, ridiculous assemblage of scenes ever put on the screen. At one point there were simultaneously 1. shots of people underwater in a van that had just gone off a bridge, 2. men shooting each other with machine-guns while skiing, 3. men fighting each other in a hotel hallway while floating in the air defying gravity, and 4. a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio at his house talking to his wife. The camera kept alternating quickly between each scene, but each one had nothing to do with the other. It was like watching a movie preview, with random, unconnected scenes thrown out in rapid succession, meant only to entice you to see the movie. Not only did scenes bear no connection to one another, they also had no relation to the scenes preceding them, and thus there was absolutely no follow-able story line at all. There was nothing but c.g.i. effects meant, I suppose, to ""entertain"" us. Do movie makers not realize that special effects, in and of themselves, do not hold one's interest if there is no connection between them and some conceivable storyline? You might as well be watching a cartoon. As with a cartoon, unless you're five years old or brain-impaired, you would become bored within five minutes, because there's no ongoing, developing story demanding your attention.",0
"I am sorry i was forced to see this film. ( i was on a date and they were 15 minutes late for the movie i wanted to see.)The story is is predictable. the ending is very predictable if you pay attention to the first 6 minutes of the film. The one thing you never do in a mystery books is let the reader get ahead of you, same goes for a movie. The viewer should never know the ending before the movie barely begins. The acting in this film is fine, most of the actors really shine in this movie BUT Leo. I use to love Leo when he was 13, but now he is an adult, and his acting hasn't dramatically improved in all these years.I would say this is going down as one of the worst movies I have seen so far this year, but there were 2 other movies that would win that title.I would recommend for anyone wanting to see this film to wait for DVD or Cable. It just isn't worth the time.",0
"This dumb waste of time take a single scientific factoid that has already been proven to be certainly untrue, interprets it in the most nonsensical way possible and weaves a convoluted narrative around that one hinge point to project an utterly flaccid one-dimensional and forced plot.The deeper you go in the faster time goes? Utter plot-serving garbage! More like the deeper they go the dumber it gets.Most overrated movie of the century.",0
Inception is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I would prefer watching the human centipede a million times than to have to sit through Inception again. It was an insult to my intelligence. It was pretentious. It was horrible. There has only been one other movie that has made me want to walk out and that was the Blair Witch Project. I couldn't understand how anyone could possibly find that movie scary. We see movies like that on youtube all the time now.Inception was ridiculous. The plot was horrible. The entire movie was just terrible there is no other way to describe it. Nothing made sense I have absolutely no idea how anyone can like this movie.,0
"Nolan is a workaday director - very good, but not an artist. He has a utilitarian approach and this film felt way too much like a Michael Bay film. Annoyingly loud sound effects and sharp and tinny mix to give the shock repeatedly to the audience with the bullets and car crashes, etc. The music - terrible. Nolan was obviously going for that David Lynchian surreal pulsing which is evocative of the subconscious mind but it just sounded like a boring, thudding drone the way his composer did it - and this dirge overlayed too many scenes which were flat without this sonic element.The acting very much has that Minority Report feel to it - this is a big Hollywood movie - lots of preening, lots of thinly drawn character archetypes rather than richly textured characters. It almost felt like a Lara Croft or Oceans 15 movie the way our motley crew of dream-invaders were brought together. And as with Sunshine, a complete waste of the talents of a noted Asian actor - this time Ken Watanabe.The forlorn protagonist played by DiCaprio, Cobb, very much reminds you of Bruce Willis from 12 Monkeys - pining for a lost love as his ground state: inexorably marching him to his destiny. The repeated use of the dining room, hotel room, and yard with little kids felt like the Vanilla Sky vignettes (with the Iain Softley lighting in K-PAX) - who's who, what's what - is he going insane? DiCaprio is a wonderful character actor and I can't wait for him to get old enough to stop playing these leading man roles he is not suited for. He lacks the heft and the gravitas to properly play them. He still seems like a boy, and a boy that my sister can beat up. It's over-the-top and mannered when he does his macho posturing and tough guy stuff.The dream element to the story was its weakest link. First off, you cannot dream-within-a-dream (however many layers) concurrently. As you are dreaming your journey morphs and sometimes you find yourself waking from a dream only to be within another dream and it can take some layers to get to actual consciousness. Inception had this dumb device of ""tipping"" our hipster team simultaneously to wake them from their various dreams levels - but they were existing in several levels at once. Meant to be clever, but just felt forced and didn't really work. Scenes and shots went on way too long. The stupid sky chase stuff in the snow and the endless assault on the fortress in the snow - ugh, get on with it.Most disappointing was what a sap our ostensible victim, Fischer, was - played by the always good Cillain Murphy. You kept hoping he would turn the tables on Cobb/DiCaprio and his gang once we got deep within the dream layers but he was just a patsy. We could have had a Dreamscape-like showdown between DiCaprio and Murphy if they had made Fischer more savvy and more vicious. It was a waste of Murphy's talents.' The subplot which became the main plot - Cobb/DiCaprio's dead wife invading his dream-piracy jobs was just stupid - this sci-fi action film devolved into a weepy chick-flick of a man making peace with his obsession with his dead wife who he thinks he killed by planting an idea in her head. Cobb/DiCaprio must take hipster-actress-flavor-of-the-moment Ellen Page, A-r-i-a-d-n-e, down to the dead zone of dreamland because psycho-dead-avatar-wifey kidnapped Saito (Watanabe) - who is going to pay them all in the real world - so they need him back. Ugh ... What a Dreams May Come lift.The spoof of oblivion in the Spongebob episode where Squidward walks in the void and his voice echoes is far more compelling.",0
"The Matrix and James Bond? A spoof maybe, but whoever made the comparison needs to get away for awhile. I loved the old Sean Connery James Bond and I thought The Matrix was an exciting movie which I watched several times to re-live the excitement. Generally speaking, I don't go to the movie theater to watch movies. I went to see Inception because of all the advertising, and this is one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen! I only stayed until the end because I kept waiting for something substantial to happen and it never did. The characters were bland (even Leo) and all that jumping from level to level was a complete waste of time.",0
"I read the hype, and came expecting to be challenged, excited and entertained. Well...the special effects were good...Ellen Page and Ken Watanabe were quite good...but story was atrocious! I like complicated movies, but this was ridiculous...too much effort on trying to keep us on the edge of our seats, and minimal success keeping us interested in any of the main characters (Ellen Page was interesting, but the others held no interest for me). I couldn't wait for it to end. There was absolutely no buy in to Cobb, or what happens to him. 2 1/2 hours was waaay too long. The story line between Cobb and his wife was laughable. It's not often I come out of movie feeling angry and really ripped off. But this movie is just a huge waste of time. Stay Away.",0
"Potentially amazing but in the end, infuriating. Was glad when it finished. I nearly called it a day a few times during the first hour. For such a complicated film the muttering dialog really didn't help in understanding this film. It seems like there was so much that should have been omitted as it had no bearing on anything. Just frustrating and boring. How it has the rating and plaudits it has is a mystery. Like it's plot.",0
This picture had potential. The music and effects were great. I did not enjoy the story line or the character's goals and ghost. The girl they paired Leonardo with didn't work.,0
"A multi layered snooze fest and a reminder of how abysmal the DiCaprio's acting really is. Ignore the hype, it's probably the same crowd who finds GOT the greatest achievement in cinematic arts.",0
"This is not a good movie. This is not an original movie. The story is not entertaining. There is no moral support to the behaviour conduct of the characters. There's a bunch of stupid rules one must obey to handle with certain subconscious layer. Can this movie be compare with Matrix? yes. But is comparable? no! Why? Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever; this one is not. It pretends to be a great movie, it pretends to be smart; they try to make intelligent dialogues and original plot...but they are just trying...nothing gets out of there! It's very easy to get it...the story...the layers...the subconscious, the ego, the alter-ego, the id...but what do they do with this concepts? the usual cliché...the struggle between the instances of the personality. Nothing original...no entertainment...no good action. This is just another sci-fi movie, nothing else",0
"We had high expectations when we arrived at this movie. 9+ on IMDb should mean that the movie was great.I expected the movie to be hard to follow, intelligent twists and deep interesting scenes. Now, the movie has some amazing visual effects sometimes similar to those in ""2012"". Unfortunately the soul of Inception is not much deeper than the one in ""2012"". At least that movie was funny.*WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS* :-) The main character has lost his family and prefers to live in a dream. This concept feels *very* similar to that in ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""The Matrix"" just to name two. The movie doesn't add anything new to this concept. The director obviously wants us to get a feeling of losing contact with reality and to get sucked into the multiple levels of dreams. Memento was a much greater success in this as it also gave us a reason to laugh and be surprised with many amazing twists.There was no moral of this movie. OR perhaps: ""If you want to play around with drugs and dream levels using a machine with a button, don't bring your wife, because 'the only thing that can get really stuck is an idea' so she might end up wanting to get to a better reality than the the real world and end up suicide to see the children again, which only existed in the dream and suicide only works to wake up from a dream, unless you're on heavy drugs, because then you'll get stuck in 'limbo'."" So a tad silly plot and moral.The couple had already grown old together in a deep level dream and experienced a long dream life. Each dream level gives a time multiplier and thus longer content.But the dream never was as good as the real life. But the greed for love made the main character want to stay in the dream. He was even fighting hard for a guy who wanted him to implant an idea (inception) into a guy's head so that he split his father's enterprise to save the world from global domination. Wow, how important is that? And how was he gonna be able to see his children again? He was just given a promise but never wanted to care if the promise could be realized.Basically the movie is about the love of children, dream levels, reality vs dream, how details in dreams can be created by yourself but it feels like someone else made it all up. This subconscious world is in itself interesting, but unfortunately this movie doesn't use that potential to give a deeper mark. This movie is unfortunately not as good as we hoped and expected. It's a wanna be intelligent with alternative worlds and lots of special-fx rubbish.The movie was worth watching, but I had hoped to get sucked into a great amazing movie, where I forgot the real world, and that just never happened.Sincerely Jan",0
"Inception has received almost unanimously good reviews in the press. So who am I to say, as an ordinary, paying member of the filmgoing public, that this movie is a dog? I have to qualify that - I left after the first hour or so (during the gunfight. Sorry, that's not very clear: during the yellow cab gunfight to distinguish it from all the other gunfights.) I really have better things to do with my time - even writing this.Back to the movie (or half of it, anyway.) Dreams within dreams within dreams don't have to be logical - I suppose they wouldn't be dreams if they were - but a story *should* be logical, or at least be capable of explanation. And this one isn't.From a screenplay point of view it just didn't hang together for me: the episodic nature of the story, such as it is, made no sense whatsoever. I realise that this was probably the intention and that presumably all would eventually become clear: it's just that I didn't have the intestinal fortitude to sit through to the end. Almost every utterance by the characters seemed to come out of thin air, with no relevance to anything else. The innumerable fights lost all meaning, and the undoubtedly clever GCI effects appeared to me to be the sole reason for making the film in the first place.""Hey, let's make a movie with CGI better than Avatar! Those effects will be great! Can we build a storyline around them?...."". Sorry, the effects *are* good (even if nothing like as stunning those in Avatar), but the complete lack of a halfway believable plot line just doesn't cut it for me.As others have said, the soundtrack didn't help: muffled dialogue and loud, pretentious music don't mix. But then again, who cares? The dialogue was truly, mindbendingly, banal.Sir Michael: you don't need the money, do you? Please use a little discrimination when accepting roles!Two out of ten - it would probably be one out of ten if I had been able to stick it to the end.(Edited: After I had posted this I looked for the first time at others' reviews, and noticed that Dylan - 24th July - has used exactly the same summary as I. There must be a clue there?)",0
"The reason the CIA does not use this crap as an enhanced interrogation tool, because after first 20 minutes you confess everything even things you have never done. I am not surprised about the current 9.0 rating though, after all we are talking about a country who actually elected Obozo. It took me three days to sit through this pseudo intellectual steaming pile of crap. So just a few words that help me release some steam: long, boring, pointless, stupid, full of clichés: like everything is blue, the vest on that stupid actor with his bottle neck shoulder ... The lesson is that I will be very careful with the next Leonardo movie, this is strike two (first being Shutter Island).",0
"Bitterly disappointed! Grossly bloated with special effects, overly saturated with testosterone and ultimately, a rip-off of two former 80's films, Brainstorm and Dreamscape, both of which I found to have much more substance. With a two and a half hour runtime, it quickly became no more than an assault on the senses. Once again, I was duped into wasting my money on an over-hyped behemoth with no redeeming qualities. As for the performances, DiCaprio came off as being slightly miscast, it seemed to me that he had to work a little too hard to get his lines out. It felt like Page, whom I do adore, was thrown in at the last minute for some token estrogen. I do always love to see Caine in small but meaty roles, this one was small but hardly meaty. AKA 'Inception: The Imax Experience' says it all. Basically, just a showcase for SFX on a very big screen.",0
"Plot, story and even the events are taken from it with some changes to fool the audience.

"Watch out of your window the street,it's going to be more interesting. There was a public holiday last week in Germany and I was able to manage to save time to watch movie on TV....This was running in parallel to some others....hmm 12 Years Slave was running on the other channel....but anyway both movies I missed the starting moment...so I knew it wouldn't work if you start in the middle somewhere to watch. But anyway I had already some negative bias against this movie(now confirmed)...reading some here and there in several times....I changed the channel and started watching about 10 minutes...with no audio...and you know...Hollywood is able produce lots of Clichés in a short time of movie history...it did not took me 1 minute to figure out....probably the idea was stolen sorry borrowed from Matrix...this Dream thing...ehhh....Well...this is neither science fiction nor action....I lately watched The Revenant....and I feel sorry for Di Caprio that He took part in this Crap.....this movie is not a good entry in his career because He is an good Actor.",0
"I was OK, but I won't bother to see it again.You can guess the ending within the first 20 minutes, predictable script in my eyes, not everybody's.Went to watch it with 5 other people who all loved it, but I was bored for the most part of it, starts slowly and takes over an hour to get into it.Even with this fictional film, I personally think that explanations of how things work are descriptions on what is being done still needs to be in there, but the joined 'dreaming' wasn't looked at and I thought that I was a bit daft. Even the Matrix tried to explain itself!The acting was good but I just thought the whole story line and plot was weak and completely uninteresting and lacking originality.All in all, the acting and special effects where good but within a poor script it won't work for me. Too predictable.",0
"..hugely overrated, underneath all the fx, cgi, noise and hand-held camera and despite the convoluted storyline, the film is nothing more than standard Hollywood fare. The troubled hero with a past history of marital problems (yawn)...you just know for certain as soon as you see his two kids that the ending will see him reunited with them..no surprises there then. Far too long and absurdly pretentious at times, I burst out laughing at one point when someone said ""Just a minute, whose subconscious are we trying to enter now"". Give me a break (and a story that has a narrative I can follow). Trying to convey the world of dreams in movies is always destined to fail. Dreams are highly personal experiences. Ever tried telling someone what you were dreaming about only to think 'Well it's very hard to explain'? Exactly - dreams don't follow any sort of cohesive narrative rather they are a series of apparently unconnected images and scenarios that appear to make no sense whatsoever.",0
"Inception is a relatively simple story made complex by the way that it is told. In that respect it is unsurprising that it was conceived at the same time that Christopher Nolan was making his breakthrough project Memento, again a simple story rendered complex by its presentationSPOILERInception is about an attempt to insert an idea into the conscious mind of a dreaming subject in such a way as to make him believe that the idea is his own or originated from his own subconscious. This is the titular ""inception"". The subject is Cillian Murphy, heir to a vast corporate empire which is close to achieving a monopoly of power generation. The idea to be implanted is that he should break up his father's corporate empire. The prime motivator is businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) who hires ideas thief Dom (Leonardo diCaprio) after the latter botches an attempt at extracting information from Saito's own dreams.Dom assembles a team comprising an architect who will design the dream spaces (Ellen Page), someone who can impersonate others in dreams (Tom Hardy) and a drug specialist who can keep them under long enough to achieve their goal. Along for the ride is Dom's long suffering partner in crime Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Saito himself. Whether the scheme succeeds and how the story plays out I will leave to the viewer to discover.END SPOILER Much of the film revolves around explaining the process of entering and monkeying with people's dreams. In this Nolan is clever as dreams are a universal shared human experience. Thus the sensation of falling which often wakes people becomes a core element of the process of stepping up out of dreams and seems entirely convincing. Whilst we know that this is fantasy it has that crucial ring of believability to it and obeys its own laws so far as the requirements of narrative and suspense allow.I suspect that people who have seen this film will fall into three categories. Males aged 14 - 21 will probably treat this film as a religious experience, ascribing it with all manner of ""important"" philosophical ""truths"". Males who were 14 - 21 in 1999 will, I suspect, hate it - accusing it of being a rip off of the ""masterpiece"" of their generation, The Matrix. Anyone else will probably see it, enjoy it and then forget it. I suspect that there is a pseudo- philosophical action film for every generation and this is simply the latest.For all that, Inception is an enjoyable film. It is roughly 43% as intelligent as it thinks it is but it is well crafted, nicely filmed and excellently acted. Leonardo diCaprio seems to have built a career out of playing damaged people with dark secrets in their past (his characters in Shutter Island, Blood Diamond, The Departed and, in fact, just about everything he has done in the last decade or so) but he is reliably good at it and is so here. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant as always, although sadly relegated to a side role. Ellen Page is good but her character simply exists to have the mechanics of the world explained to her and the audience, thus she has little chance to shine. The show-stealer is Tom Hardy who has almost all of the film's funny lines and all but one of the funny moments. The special effects are impressive but restrained, as with the best films they support the story rather than become the point of it.The weakest element is the plot which is very simple but then maybe it needs to be. With the added confusion of different layers of reality intermingling anything more complex would have required that moviegoers be handed a flowchart on leaving the cinema (which would have been very welcome in the case of 2004's Primer http://xkcd.com/657/large/).In closing I'd like to add my own slant to the debate as to the closing scene. It strikes me that what is important is not whether it falls but the fact that Dom doesn't care if it does or doesn't. Perhaps the message is that reality is what we decide it is.",0
"This movie was just OK. Fun to watch, and nothing more. Dreams and dreams within a dream were subjects to many fine movies throughout history of cinematography, and this one is, by no means, the best amongst them. Not even one of the better. Can't really understand such overjoyed reviews, as though world is going to change after watching this movie. Most of 10 star ratings are probably given by the people from WB -- some kind of a viral promotion, I guess. The main problem of the movie is that Nolan the writer wanted to say a lot and had opened a lot of questions, but Nolan the director couldn't quite cope with that. Some of those questions were to big and pretentious for him at this stage of his career. He is a fine craftsman, but still nothing more. The end of the movie is to trivial and easy, almost expected. Shutter Island is much better example of ""making me insane"" effect. Even Cronenberg's eXistenZ has better ending.",0
"First of all, let me assure you that I am not writing this review just to be contrary or go against the grain, but in all honestly I am completed baffled by the public's response to Inception, and even more so by the IMDb community's reaction.Before seeing the film I had been hearing rave reviews, so I admittedly went into it with quite high expectations. I sat in the cinema expecting to be blown away. The film started...I saw some cool special effects, heard an interesting plot line, observed moderate to poor character development, lots of completely typical action-movie sequences, and then the film ended. I walked out of the theater confused.""10/10""? ""a masterpiece""? Please! I keep reading reviews that describe the plot as ""complex"" and ""multi-layered""-- but it simply is not! Just because Leonardo Di Caprio and his team are traveling through ""multiple layers of consciousness"", does not in itself add additional layers to the plot. In fact, the plot was fairly one dimensional: there was one goal (inception) and almost everything in the movie was directly related to achieving it. The only other vague subplot in the entire film was related to DiCaprio's past with his wife (Cottilard). Beyond that, where is this ""depth"" everyone is talking about? Am I missing something? What is so mind-boggling and ingenious about the thought of a dream that is within a dream which is turn within another dream? I really admire Leonardo Di Caprio and Marion Cottilard's talent (I thought Blood Diamond, Revolutionary Road, and La Vie En Rose were great films) but their real talent is not on display here. Their acting felt flat and forced. And I also agree with other reviewers that the casting of Juno's Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was awkward.I really wanted to love this movie just as much as everyone else, I really did, but I can't put depth where it isn't.Don't get me wrong, it is generally a good movie, but not THAT good. Come on people, Inception does not even begin to live up to all of the hype surrounding it. By typical IMDb standards I can't see how this would get much higher than an 7.5/8 or so.I'm just astonished at all of the excessively positive reviews on this site-- some even compare Inception to a religion, and put Nolan in the same category as Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Tarkovsky, which is completely absurd.A week of reflection on this film has not changed my opinion of it, and I'm left thinking the hype surrounding Inception is either a (more successful version of) the Emperor's New Clothes or else that there's a beautiful suit there and I just can't see it.",0
"Disappointed is the watchword.After the hype, the very least we were to expect was some post-Matrix multidimensional psychotropic thriller made by the Stanley Kubrick of his generation.Well, Nolan is no Kubrick, Inception has none of the surprise, technical adeptness or tangible dread of the Matrix and the plot is as multidimensional as the cardboard cutout characters.Instead, we got too many hours of a badly stitched together quartet of substandard action pieces with some badly depicted bogus technology, all glued together with a load of sentimental schlock.Shameful that this cost so much money to make when so many people are dying of starvation around the world. I felt truly ripped off, almost as much as when Equilibrium was foisted upon unsuspecting audiences.Save your money by donating it to a worthy cause or buying a copy of the much more superior Existenz.Unfortunately, reality ain't what it used to be.",0
"This is the worst film I've seen in a long time. I think I can imagine what other people who are raving about the film like; but I can guarantee that the rating of this film will plummet in a year when the slight novelty of the special effects wears off. The ""story"" here is the story of a role-playing video game, where you get trapped into deeper and deeper levels without knowing what to expect. As you go, the rules change. This is convenient for the writers, who simply make it all up as they go along. If you liked Matrix, you will like this film. You will probably like Titanic, Avatar, and other films that dangle flashy special effects in front of your eyes. If you would rather play a video game than read a book, you might like this film.If on the other hand you like dramas about human beings, then skip this one. It's a waste of time and money.",0
"Firstly I want to say that I am fan of clever films that challenge the brain, however, it is possible for a film to be so complicated, and frankly...boring, that it becomes difficult to hold your interest. This was definitely the case with this movie.Obviously the visual effects were excellent, that goes without saying, but I left the movie thinking ""what was the actual point?"". I am sure a lot of people must just be jumping on the band wagon by rating this movie highly, of perhaps pretending to get it, as I am positive I cannot be the only one that found this film over complex and just plain rubbish. In fact, I heard many of the people saying similar things as they left the cinema.I like a film to entertain me, and having heard everyone raving about this film I was bitterly disappointed to find it was a total ""try too hard"" yawn-fest. The concept was good, however it just didn't hit the mark and was thoroughly un-entertaining. I found myself drifting off wondering about what I would eat for dinner,and about things I needed to do at work the next day, and that is the sign of a BAD movie.9.2 out of 10? I don't think so, but each to their own.",0
Such as title.Plagiarism is shameful.It is worse to be a scoundrel than not to admit your mistakes.,0
Properly the most overrated film ever. Contrived crap. One of those films every says they love because somehow they have to go with the flow. Over complicated lacking any character progression. It should be a mediocre blockbuster but because it is made by a very good director on his day and a damn good actor (but not in this) it is lauded. This explains more about the world than this piece of .....,0
This movie is overrated. For controlling a person's dream you should get bunch of people like architectors all this stuff wait what. Movie was boring. Save your time.,0
"Muddled through this long and confusing film, never sure what was happening, whose dream we are watching, how many levels deep, and how it related to the concept of the film. Too Long. Too Confusing. One Star.",0
"Finally went to see Inception, since everyone and everything was telling it was a great movie. By the end of the show I was thinking: ""woah, great flick"" then as the adrenaline wore off, I kept thinking ""seriously???"" and the more I thought about it the more I hated it:It has a non-existent storyline: If you ask yourself what this movie is *really* about the answer is absolutely nothing, but that it may be OK, some nice movies are this way (pulp fiction, for example)But then, it has the shallowest plot I've seen in ages, with flat characters chopped out from wood: not a memorable line of dialogue, not anything that really says anything about some of the characters. NothingAnd finally has such an overly played out underlying philosophy that is embarrassing, already explored 10x better in movies like Exsistenz, Matrix and so forthSo, Mr Nolan having to deal with high pressure nothing, decided that the only way to handle this movie was overcomplicate it, hence the dream inside a dream inside a dream inside a dream, with the open and questioning finale.Basically a multimillion cinematographic gimmick.In hindsight, memento is not that much different, just another different gimmick, but at least was fresh enough to be interesting.Anyway enough negativity, on the good side this movie is a very nice adrenaline ride with a great timing and the usual Nolan's good cinematography, and too many gunfight and will keep you interested enough till the end.",0
"This movie is a long waste of time. It's all about special effects and confusing plot twists. It's idea at the basis is understandable but they go about carrying it out in way too convoluted a manner and get carried away with plots within plots. It makes The Matrix seem like child's play. Save your time and money and watch a movie that makes sense and is enjoyable. I just got my review back and it said I had to be long, like this movie, and review it with at least 10 lines of text. How much more can I say about a movie that wasted 2.5 hours of my time in the theater and now requires I waste more time in reviewing it? I have never cared much for Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor and his only redeeming feature was his work for the environment and involvement with the movie (scarely seen by anyone) entitled, The 11th Hour (2007). That is a movie I do recommend watching. Other than that, he did 'ok' in Shutter Island, a movie which is far superior to Inception.",0
"I read all these reviews stating how this is the most intellectual movie ever made. I wonder if that's because the people writing those reviews are egotistical sociopaths.There's nothing intellectual about the idea of a dream within a dream within a dream. The premise is simple. The soundtrack has to be the most complicated thing about this mess.Inception is a bait and switch film focused on people hired to trick a guy into ripping apart his fathers company so that it's largest competitor wins. They do this by sedating the scarecrow from batman in a series of dreams within dreams to convince him he's dreaming. The van they all are passed out in gets attacked the entire time to create some suspense. Then jack from titanic lives forever in a dream.I'd rather watch Kevin hart implode his career. Maybe that's what I'll watch next on Netflix. His documentary and this film have equally annoying soundtracks. At least I know what I'm going into... a waste of time, just like inception. Now you won't be able to get my opinion out of your head. Waste of time. Inception.",0
"Watch DREAMSCAPE on Y/T. Made in 1984, the story still holds up. Inception is just a modern re-make. Watch it and see.

Simply a pointless and unexciting movie to watch the two and half hours are gone in vain.Don't know why this got much hype and positive reviews,0
"Unfortunately for me, I disliked this movie. I am not quite sure why. I heard good things about this movie and I wanted to like it so much. It rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. I knew a little bit about the dream information in this movie. That is my only theory on why I didn't like this movie.Anyways I usually like special effects movies and contrary to what I wrote, I hope you like it.One day I might watch it again... Maybe I will like it the second time around. I liked to think I have mature a bit and with it my taste for movies.",0
"Well, despite the fact that there are lots of good actors in this movie, it doesn't make it good. I like Nolan's other movies like Memento or Batman series, but this one is really bad. Plot is boring & jumbled & it's also very long. It's just a big mess. Lots of pointless action scenes. They even took some scenes (winter shooting) from Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. Movie itself Kinda reminded Matrix, but a bad version. Soundtrack is good, but it doesn't suit the movie. It's too sad for it. By the way Leonardo Dicaprio's character reminds me his another character from the movie ""Shutter Island"", where he plays some guy that has deep seated emotional issues relating to the loss of a loved one.To be honest, I can't believe that this piece of garbage is rated so high... In other words: LONG. BORING. JUMBLED.",0
"Warning contains spoilers!!!!Leo is trapped in a dream, he is not in someone else's, how you tell is that everyone has Leo's hair cut and style of clothing, plus in all the scenes he makes the rules. So Leo's kids who have grown up since their mother died appear to Leo as architects and try and remind him of the real world and fail. This is exactly what happens in what dreams may come. The son appears first and then the daughter, and they appear different from how the dad's remember them. Also just like in What Dreams may Come Leo has to go deeper into the dream to try and save his wife. So is this just a What Dreams May Come remake masquerading as an original masterpiece? If that was the goal he nailed it because nobody is comparing this to What Dreams May Come, and of all the questions people ask about the movie no one asks just who are the architects and why are they so invested in waking Leo? It is because it is a rip off of What Dreams May Come and they are his Son and his Daughter? Do Nolan fans need a rabbit trail of clues to beat them over the head to even think something has the slightest significance? He didn't play up the Son Daughter thing so nobody got it I guess. Other than being a remake, inception is completely boring and void of any character development, emotion, and none of the scenes stand out. It was like watching the Titanic with a bunch of senseless action thrown in so guys wouldn't walk out of the theater. The movie gets dumber and dumber trying to make up the for almost 2 hours it spent boring you with conventions trying to get you to see it is Leo's dream and fails horribly being that everybody focused so much on the rules that they didn't see that the point was to show you it was Leo's dream? So all the people claiming the rules laid out didn't add up, you missed the point that Leo was the rules, it was his dream. I really hate that people think if you don't like inception you are not smart seeing as none of the people who gave this 10 stars understand any of what I have mentioned here? If Nolan's movies where intellectual they wouldn't be blockbuster hits and appeal to masses of people would they? What Nolan is great at is giving clues and his movies are films that have to give the audience clues because they can't figure it out them self and I guess today that makes you a film genius. Once is all it took I will never watch this Michael Bay hybrid again. I put this with viewing experiences like Titanic, and The Island, and rate them as I want my money back and two plus hours you wasted of my life.",0
"What are you trying to show, Mr. Nolan? That there is always an enemy, even in deepest dreams? And that we have to fight it to make humanity come true? A budget of 160.000.000 and a gross of more than 800.000.000 for this waste? Oh, I have to consider, that it was bought all over the world. Seems that millions and millions of people wanted it. Did they? It has nothing common with dreams I know, with any kind of interacting, living together, as I know. I could not feel anything after the children at the very beginning were off.Yes, it's important to look, to discover, what consciousness is, what dreams are, what spirit and mind are.Yesterday I wrote down my reviews for ""In A Better World"" and ""Another Earth"", one day before for ""Solyaris"". I think I'm opened up for dreaming, for reflect about it, I'm opened up for art.This movie throws a lot of waste in the way to art and consciousness.Was it ironical, tongue in cheek? No, they believe in that. It becomes bigger and bigger, meanwhile it surely has become a Billion Dollar thing. What did you dream? - It's alright, we told you what to dream. So welcome to the machine.",0
"When Inception came out in the Summer of 2010, everyone made a big deal about it. I just rented Inception and I can't understand what all the hoopla was about. It's essentially a cheap copy of The Matrix which came out 11 years before in 1999. Someone at the rental store said he had a hard time staying awake while he saw it. The same thing happened to me which is incredibly ironic since Inception involves sleeping. It was boring and at over 2 hours long I was wondering if I should speed up the playback to 1.2x speed. It was so boring that I took a break and saw Attack of the Puppet People (1958) which was actually more interesting! Then I returned to Inception and saw the second half.I can't understand how Inception managed to make $300M. It must have been marketing and hype orchestrated by the studios. I am so glad I only paid $1.25 to see this boring tripe. If you haven't already seen the original or haven't seen it for a few years, rent The Matrix. It's far better.5 out of 10 stars",0
"Let me begin by saying that I have absolutely enjoyed everything DiCaprio has done since 2002 and that I immensely enjoyed Nolan's works in the past.And let me admit that Nolan did a great job to bring this complex idea to screen. However, the biggest problem with this movie was that you could have cared less for what happened to its characters. ""Inception borrows heavily from 'The Matrix', a much better film in entertainment terms, though Neo and the others were a lot easier to care for than this bunch.""Let's starts by DiCaprio's wife who was absolutely annoying and her story was getting repetitive as hell. It seems like Nolan enjoys casting annoying actresses for main roles as he did with Gyllenhaal and Katie Holmes in Batman. ""How many times did they have to rehash the pain of DiCaprio and his wife....his wife that didn't even exist! Fine he had issues but seriously, there is a limit to how much of it we have to watch over and over...WE GET IT, he's racked with guilt and misses her!"" DiCaprio and his gang, well I couldn't care less for them either. During the whole movie there was no good guy whom I cheered for or whose cause I cared for and no bad guy who I hated, or somewhat admired (such as Joker in Dark Knight). ""The characters don't have a lasting effect on me at all and just seem like a means to an end. You know what might help? How about writing dialogue that elicits more than one or two laughs from the audience during the entire course of the film? I don't think I've ever seen a director take himself so seriously."" ""And then there is the dialogue. Oh my god.....I have never seen anything trying to be so overly intense. I mean, a character could have said ""I feel like a sandwich for lunch"" and there would have been ominous music and dark glares. I am convinced there are tonnes of people that are afraid to give negative reviews for fear of being labelled ""stupid"". It shoved ""I am an intelligent movie"" down your throat while the plot was simply ""a cool technology exists that allows us to share dreams, so now we must use it to plant an idea in some trust fund baby's head"". The movie was unpredictable because it was simply the writer's creativity and had no boundaries. The story wasn't responsible for ...well...anything (except for drawing things out at a snails pace)."" Then comes the last scene, where I just felt like this is just a terrible movie, but to second guess myself by saying, maybe it is great and I'm missing something. I mean bunch of people, all dressed the same, running in the snow and shooting endlessly at each other, creating no excitement, and the audience has no clue of the progression that the good guys are making. And at points you forget what the hell they are doing there. Not to mention how ridiculous it gets as non of the bad guys seems to be able to hit a target as big a barn door. The whole scene looked like a bad James Bond movie. The movie had me looking for something cool or even vaguely interesting and every time I started to get my hopes up it just kinda droned on then trailed off. Regardless, I just want to point out that, hey, it's okay to just like 'Inception' without having to pick a side that says it's a masterpiece or a side that thinks it's complete rubbish. 'Inception' isn't a movie that will ""change how movies are made."" It's just a well done movie that creates the illusion that it's the thinking person's movie that never gives the viewer a chance to think. It's a mass marketed intellect. It's like a KFC Double Down that's sprinkled with truffles. But, hey, I am part of the masses and, you know what, sometimes maybe I do want to eat a fancy KFC Double Down. Which is why I liked 'Inception,' but why I also think it's still just a KFC Double Down.The movie was fine in many aspects, although it had massive loop holes, and is perhaps worth the watch, and I don't like using the word ""overrated,"" but it's nothing close to what Dark Knight was.",0
"Before you read this, don't misunderstand me, Inception was a solid movie. Far above average. The only thing I believe made it a disappointment was the fact that it was a Christopher Nolan film, and definitely NOT his best. It doesn't hold a candle to the intensity, complexity and intelligence of Memento. It didn't achieve the strong style and shocking brilliance of either Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. It didn't establish the sense of wonder that the Prestige left the viewer feeling.Inception had an incredible concept. One that I believe could have set the base for Christopher Nolan's most impressive film to date, but he took this concept and threw 180 million dollars into special effects rather than a solid story and really Grade A acting. Now DiCaprio's performance in Inception was excellent but most of the accompanying actors were average action flick performances. Which was a disappointment because in Nolan's greater films, he usually puts the acting of the side characters before the lead (Memento: Teddy. TDK: The Joker). I feel like Chris Nolan got wrapped in by Hollywood and decided to make an action film with a psychological plot, than a psychological thriller with some action sequences. Not his most intelligent, or captivating film to date, but still worth the price of admission.",0
"Chris Nolan is one of my favorite modern directors. He tries great things in almost every movie he makes. Weather he succeeds or not, he always feels like a wizard, playing with our perception, and proving us that the perception makes the ""truth"". In Inception he tried the impossible: to build a story spanning different levels of consciousness. Technically it might be argued that he partially succeeded. He even succeeds suggesting how the perception modifies when changing the level of consciousness. But he fails to play with our own perception of the subject. Not quite the Nolan I was expecting.
9 for the inception, 6 for the story, 3 for the delivery.",0
"The central idea of the movie is interesting, and Leonardo DiCaprio does decent job as Cobb. That's about it for the positive sides of the movie. There's quite a few loop holes and laws of physics are broken without any reasonable explanation. It's silly that laws of physics only apply when it's suitable for the plot and they just don't if it isn't. The ending is said to be mind-blowing and suprising but it was neither. Sorry to say, but I can't understand the hype for this movie. The only reason you should probably check this out, is to understand what Simpsons are referring to in one episode.",0
It was a little bit predictable and the end was obvious. I think this movie is overrated. I really liked all christopher nolan movies but this one. I also believe that i watched interstellar first so i kept my hopes high. But it was not all bad. I really loved the story between cobb and mal. Cobb's love for his children really effected me. Also tom hardy and cillian murphy killed it.,0
"Inception is mildly interesting but emotionally flat. There's nothing 
 DiCaprio's character does at the end that he couldn't have done at the 
 beginning of his story. He hasn't undergone an emotional arc at all, 
 he's just gone through a lot of noisy, silly plot machinations that add 
 up to too many action sequences (though some are fun) looking for a 
 movie. The ""psychological"" stuff in the movie is 1950s Freudian -- 
 really it's at the level of a Looney Tunes cartoon's parody of analysis 
 in terms of a real look at what dreams are -- with certain phrases 
 repeated so often (""they're not real, they're a projection;"" ""If you're 
 killed in a dream, you wake up"") you'd think the audience was taken as 
 morons. The story is needlessly complicated, with its three- level 
 examination of one story (a father-son relationship) given short 
 shrift, and the DiCaprio story never fully wrapped up given the 
 director's silly ending where he refuses to ultimately define what's a 
 dream and what's not. The movie will be praised to the skies because 
 early reviewers want to be seen as hip and sophisticated with what is 
 admittedly better fare than the usual Hollywood summer fluff (viz, 
 Predators). But this movie is as much a failure as Benjamin Buttons: 
 overly arcane story-telling by a talented director who's given an 
 unlimited budget to make a story no one is brave enough to say is banal 
 and turgid and opaque. The Dark Knight has tons of emotion (even if the 
 plot is weak, especially in the final third). Memento was a thinking 
 man's story if ultimately full of holes and devoid of any real emotion. 
 Inception has good acting, great effects and a plot that may or may not 
 make sense -- but why would anyone take the time to decipher it? 
 Because the story carries no emotion, it all feels like a trick the 
 director-writer thinks he's playing on us. It's The Game with another 
 level or two or three of plot, but just as devoid of real emotion. 
 While you may not be bored, you won't be satisfied, so it's still a 
 waste of two and one-half hours.",0
"Somewhat belatedly I reviewed INCEPTION . The reason for the delay is because I think Nolan is the most overrated director working today . I'm not saying he's a bad director just an overrated one whose films seem to rocket high up in to the IMBDb top 250 list . He is a good ideas man but like Michael Crichton for over 20 years the premise of his films aren't fully developed and his ideas often owe more to other people . The idea of a film taking place in reverse is as old as cinema itself believe it or not . INTERSTELLAR owes much to 2001 and an apocalyptic novel by John Christopher written in 1956 and with INCEPTION .... oh dear INCEPTION On a visual level INCEPTION is very impressive . We've all seen those nifty trailers with characters standing around in the middle of collapsing landscapes . This isn't really indicative of how the film plays out . Instead we have pretty boy character A meeting character B Character A : "" You know how when you have a dream blah blah blah ?"" Character B: ""Yes"" Character A: ""Blah blah blah"" and by the time pretty boy has explained the plot mechanics and exposition to character XYZ I felt like someone should be waking me up . Not only that but some of us are old enough to remember other - and dare I state better ? - virtual reality movies . At the end of the day INCEPTION reminds me of one of Steven Moffat's timey wimey twist turney tales from DOCTOR WHO that is trying to be too clever and at the same time ends up becoming a mess and the reaction of ""Oh my gosh what a very clever original idea"" from IMDb commentators leaves me perplexed",0
"DiCaprio, that stupid-Hollywood-made-kid thinks he can walk into someone dream as simple as I walk down the road ? I got sick after few minutes watching this moron playing as he pick-up whole intellect of the universe and acting as a God.His act is pure s.h.i.t.Does his mom ever watch him on TV ? Can't imagine how stupid these Americans can be...My recommendations: Don't loose another 2 hours of your precious life watching this film. To mods: for God sake of all people let this comment be posted and you'll be better man too.",0
"Nolan's only good movie was Interstellar. The man makes the most boring films in existence and idiots will eat it up, even if he directed literal dog poo on the sidewalk, and hail him a ""genius"". Give me a break. I had a dream within a dream within a dream that people actually saw Nolan for the con artist he is.",0
This is not an 8.8. This movie has an awful story line. And it is impossible to follow. It not a good movie. I give it 1 out of 10. Because it awful. There is reason why people like this movie. But I could tell you. If you like good science fiction movie. Do not see this . See Alien or Aliens or Alien 3 or Alien Resurrection or Alien vs Predator or Alien vs Predator requiem or Prometheus or Godzilla. Do not wast your time. Do not wast your money and see this crap. King Kong is a good movie. So is Son of Kong. So is King vs Godzilla. King Kong escapes is also great film. King Kong live is also a good movie. So mush better then this crap.,0
"... than to be remembered as the movie which posed as no. 3. A rating of eight stars would have been appropriate. Definitely seven. Nine? In dreams perhaps. So here is one star. Just to bring balance back to force... And please stop making parallels to Matrix. In this one there is more than merely FX. Makes you want to know more. The Matrix, well, everyone understood. It deserves to be seen. It even deserves to be own on Blu-ray. Not every day you get to see a dynamic Escher or Paris packing on itself. Unfortunately there is little more that meets the eye. A top 10 IMDb? Doubtful. Toy Story 3 is no. 12. And that one made me think more about meanings in life.",0
"I did not enjoy this film one bit and its hard to know even where to begin. The plot is confusing to say the least and at no time did I understand anything that was happening. I felt the film was trying too hard to be different and had a certain Matrix feel to it in a bad way, the effects were good but to be perfectly frank I'm well aware of what directors can do with effects in movies these days so I'm not particularly impressed when they start doing elaborate visual effects just for the sake of it. I felt there was no character development at all and spent most of the movie wondering why the characters were doing what they were doing and eventually started to realise that the aim is to keep you on the edge of your seat but to be perfectly honest I wasn't kept on the edge of my seat in any sense and just found it incredibly frustrating. I believe at times the film tries to cash in on everyone's common knowledge of dreams in the way of ""oh yeah it is hard to remember my dreams, and there doesn't seem to be a beginning or an end in my dreams, I thought I was the only one"" type of situation which the film does to try and make you believe its almost talking directly to you but personally I'm not fooled, yes its a novel concept which I think has given a few a few easily pleased people the wow factor but when the smoke clears I hope the punters realise there are better ways to spend 2hrs and 20 odd minutes or better films to watch. The other frustrating thing about this movie is how complex and hard it is to take in all the information about dreams and your sub -conscious and how all this works when they're trying to get into someone's head, it went massively too deep and for a few split seconds it was a bit thought provoking but that quickly turned into frustration and a slightly stressed feeling because it just raises far to many questions which the film just doesn't, and probably can't answer. To summarise I would say that Chris Nolan did the most amazing job on the Dark Knight but this has really let him down, he has picked a great cast for the film and all are superb actors but couldn't identify with this film one bit and really just couldn't wait for it to end.",0
"I cannot believe this movie is as praised as it is. All I have to say is, if you have imagination, read good books, and know real surrealism of the likes of Dali, Bunel and Magritte you will and should disapprove. Go watch some Kubrick an Lynch if in search of philosophical, aesthetically pleasing and atmospheric movies and dont waste your time, it has no plot, characters are more like caricatures but not in a good way, you cant take them seriously, and they explain everything throughout the movie. Dont.waste.your.time.",0
"Wannabee matrix in a confusing package. I guess if you watch it 3 times it'll make some sense, maybe , but I could barely finish watching once.",0
High reviews had their 10 rating planted into their head that this was actually a good movie. Since i had't much sleep in the last few days..... I saw this movie for what it actually is. Completely noisy trash that contained slow motion special effects as its only redeeming quality.,0
"The movie has a new and great idea Ha Ha,(The Matrix)but,its too confusing jumping back and forth from the different levels of the states of sleep. The average movie viewer won't grasp the Conception of inception. If they would have left it on one level of the dream state I think it would have been a lot better of a movie. The special effects were great,but what move now has anything that you haven't seen somewhere already. I just saw this movie and i'm a big movie buff but, This movie sucks. If you like special effects and a lot of shoot'em up, go for it. As for me it was the worst movie i've seen all this year so far. I think the people giving it 5 stars are in a dream of inception.",0
"A dream within a dream within a dream. I wanted someone to shoot me in the face so I could wake up and be out of the cinema. It was trying so hard to be intellectual when it really isn't. At best it's ok, but god does it drag on. Like a constipated bowel movement you just want to get rid of.",0
"K SO I WAS PRETTY DAMN MAD AT THIS MOVIE,So this movie has this issue of being bad, it was that. k so the review actually starts here. it was really bad when I watched this film it was bad, they might have made it better since i watched it. bit still unless u drink a v8 b4 u read this its gonna be a bad. all my friends agree. worst movie Na. GI friend. oblivion is the Best. i require 10 lines of text so ill have to droll this on, MC loving is really bad at this film so don't gibe it more than a 4 OK, hes a bad actor other than in basket ball diaries. if Ur like me thats the only film by him that i like. South park version way better.Mesa",0
"Very confusing and I am really not a fan of DiCaprio, another overrated actor. It was all all down hill after Titanic in my opinion",0
You must have had no choice but to reach the bottom of the barrel and scrape it to come up with Ellen Page to be in this movie. She's a terrible actress and pulls down the movie overall.,0
"I have no idea if this got better or not because I kept falling asleep and my 24 hour rental period ended before I could finish it so I'm giving it a 5 based on what I saw. First off, I am not a fan of sci-fi so that may make this an unfair review but I love Leonardo DiCaprio and this film came highly recommended by several friends. I also saw it was highly rated. But I don't get it. It's so ridiculous, nothing like this could ever happen so I was unable to get into the story. All I could focus on was how ridiculous it was and wonder why people like stuff like this. I couldn't even appreciate Leo's acting because he was playing a role in a film about nonsense. I like when acting seems real and this film didn't allow that to happen. If you are not into science fiction, fantasy, action or special effects or anything like that and prefer more reality with your films then I would skip this because there is nothing about it this could ever be possible. I just found myself rolling my eyes and as I said before, dozing off.",0
"Stanely Kubrick was full of great ideas that would, maybe to others, be unfilmable; but under his hands, they were living, breathing dreamworlds. Surprisingly, for how mind-numbingly intellectual his films were, it seems they were (wisely) portrayed minimalistically. Everything that happened in Kubrick's films did not happen on screen and his scripts, while complicated, were amazingly coherent. The audience's imagination is freed this way. Of course, both Nolan and Kubrick are expressionists, but where Kubrick's films were coherent Nolan's are often frustrated into utter incoherence.The Dark Knight series lacked real emotional power due to this over-complicatedness, despite having, at times, the ""cool"" factor. Inception is no different. It could be riveting and interesting IF there was intellectual breathing room. Instead, the mind is suffocated with concepts taken to extremes that would better fit a TV series than a single film.Inception has good action and a really interesting concept, but as usual Nolan takes it as far as it can go - and than a little bit further, eventually crossing the line into incoherence. Like Kubrick, I think Nolan is one of those amazing people straddling the fence between genius and insanity. Sometimes we get the insanity.",0
"I reviewed this on my blog http://puedisplif.blogspot.com/2010/10/inception-dream-little- bigger.html this is the latter part of the review, if any one has any thoughts...I have a few points, or rather questions to share:1. Why does Ellen Page's character follow Di Caprio's character in a mission that he describes as ""illegal"" before even explaining what it is about, what's in it for her and in fact even before showing what cool things she can do once inside a dream? He's a perfect stranger to her, yet she doesn't even blink and follows him in an illegal mission. It's a carrot without a stick and she follows it? Disbelief trembling slightly here.2. IV tubes with sedative stick out of a machine in a briefcase. OK. I understand that's how the characters fall asleep, the machine has a timer to wake them up, but how is one person's subconscious linked to another's to share the same dream? That's not explained, just go along with it. Disbelief quivering here.3. An idea cannot be erased and it's so strong it will just not go away, it will grow and grow until it has reached whatever aim it set out to reach. Well, I can tell you that ideas DO go away. If I remembered half of the ideas I have on a daily basis, right now my head would be bursting, but I'd have plenty to write about. Sure some ideas stick with us for a long time, even a life-time. The most topical. Fixed ideas. But they are the exception rather than the rule methinks. So my disbelief is flipping and falling off a hammock here.4. Fischer is the heir to an empire of a corporation and victim of the Inception. Saito is the head of another corporation, a rival, who commissions the Inception to make Fischer destroy the empire. Surely Fischer would know what Saito looks like. He tags along with our heroes and shows his face to Fischer (in a dream yes, but there is no indication that in the dream faces are changed, save for one character who morphs on purpose), so why doesn't Fischer ever recognise Saito? Even if he believed him to be a figment of his imagination, he'd still have to think that it was a bit odd and suspicious to have a rival tycoon walk around in his dream. My disbelief here is quaking so bad it's expecting to see the floor topple and become the ceiling.Did I enjoy the film? I can't wait to fall asleep and let my neurons go wild and take me away.",0
"One of the worst trends in cinema over the last few years is the number of blockbuster films that have been devoid of plot. The majority of the big summer movies could have a plot synopsis written on the back of a business card. As the cinema screen explodes in front of your eyes, you long for a word containing more than two syllables.Inception is a break from that tradition and for that alone it must be commended. The film follows Cobb (DeCaprio) who can extract information from people by breaking into their dreams. He is tasked with performing the more difficult task of planting an idea into a dream - The inception. He gets together a team of people who will help him accomplish the mission.First the bad news. I didn't particularly feel any emotional investment with any of the characters. The film doesn't really have goodies and baddies in the traditional sense. That is not a bad thing, but I simply didn't care very much what happened to any of the characters.Now for the good news. The script and acting are all first rate. The effects are also very good and you have to say that Christopher Nolan is building up a great cv. DeCaprio must be a contender for next years best actor Oscar and it would be surprising if he doesn't get at least a nomination. The supporting cast are also good and I've always enjoyed watching Ellen Page.The best thing of all about the film is the ending. Pure class.",0
"I can't believe the rave reviews and the all star cast. I've never been an hour into a film with no idea of what's going on. And I understand astrophysics, and am a sci-fi lover. I don't understand what their goal is at all. Just feels a disjointed version of 'the matrix'
Such great actors and cgi for such a ridiculous hard to follow story.",0
"A very boring film, too long and without any emotion, very bad.",0
Christopher Nolan's weird stuff.....Not that great movie.,0
"10 years on in 2020, I revisited this movie trying to see if it was me that hated it or was it really beyond my time and abilities! . Nah. This movie is just rubbish still. This movie is not for any mature person. Young people (ideally below 25 years of age) who have unrealistic imagination and is willing to gobble up any gobbledegook these days are perfect for this. If you have any degree in medicine, you puke early on. Otherwise you may just sit it out half way. The only other way is to sleep and create a dream that you finished the movie. It is so characteristic of this day and age where people are afraid to call BS just because they think that they have to be seen as appreciating things that others have upvoted; -similar to be seen as enjoying "" modern art"" which is just rubbish doodling. Waste of time, but if you fast forward it and just see the ""effects"" you could avoid wasting your time.",0

"This is an awful movie and pretentious by trying to make it so hard to understand it has to be explained. the entire concept is well, rather silly- i am always amazed why science fiction beliefs are lauded and supposedly intellectual-to me sci fi is the same as believing in any fantasy--fairies, the para normal even santa claus-- all illogical. this movie is a prime example of that.",0

So confusing and complex and boring!! Better to be much shorter.,0
"Lost in the sauce. idea was good but the movie is too irritating, boring and way too long",0
I agree the concept was good . The film had potential. But it is lost in the execution. Christopher Nolan is a visionary no doubt about that but seriously this is a very mediocre film and probably very overrated.,0
This is just a action Hollywood mind blow filme by the underrated Nolan,0
"I gave this movie only one star , though it's worth more, but since so many reviewers rated it 10 or 9 stars i had to give less. It is probably one of the most overrated movies on IMDb.I hoped it would be exciting experience, a friend recommended it, and also IMDb rating was great so I hoped for a great movie-evening.I loved the idea of the movie, I had some experience myself with lucid dreaming etc. so I was kind of excited about it.. but what a disappointment.It's just soooo boring from the beginning. I watched it to the end hoping something will change my mind, but further it went more boring it became.In this dream world movie there's almost no fantasy at all. Boring shooting, fighting scenes and car races most of the time. And then some boring conversations with no sense at all.My advice- don't waste your time even to see why some people gave it 9 or 10 stars. Just avoid, sincerely...",0
"Inception is certainly ambitious. And once again Nolan succeeds at doing exactly what you would expect him to do; delivering sleek, thought provoking entertainment. At it's core, however, this film is missing a few vital pieces that leave a certain something to be desired. The emotional crux of Inception is clear; It's about Leonardo DiCaprio's character and his ultimate reconciliation with the regrets he has regarding his wife. That element of the film is spelled out crystal clear and is effective. The problem comes in that there's a great deal of other subject matter that seems to exist only as thin props in Leo's quest.After a relatively pointless setup in which the two main characters garner his wrath, Ken Watanabe's character offers them an incredibly simplistic and convenient ultimatum, and from then on out the rest of Leo's merry band seems to jump on board with the operation for no discernible reasons. Ellen Page? Seeking college credit, apparently. Tom Hardy? Well, his character has nothing better to do. JG Levitt? He's Leo's buddy, you'll have to take our word for it. Oh, and Michael Caine...he's about as useful as John Voight in National Treasure. The trouble with this, then, is that the action-based objective has no real power and urgency other than the promise of seeing Leo hug his kids... and seeing the incredibly sketchy Cillian Murphy character hug his dying, old, tycoon father. Neither of which are sufficient emotional investments. A lot of this can be attributed to the simple fact that there is NO antagonist in the movie. None. No one is evil, not even Leo's subconscious. Nothing is pushing back other than a vague threat of ""projections"" and the main character accidentally sabotaging the mission. In summary...where's Agent Smith? It's basic rules of drama and storytelling that have been around since Aristotle; tension is created through opposition. Sure, there's a time limit to the group's escape from the various dream states, but no one is trying to stop them. Therefore, why should I really care what happens? The supporting characters in this group live and die for a man they hardly know, for a goal that isn't even (at the very least) of monetary consequence. Yet, instead of defining these elements that matter more, the film instead spends a gratuitous amount time explaining arbitrary ""rules"" of the dreamworld, even though it simply glosses over the basics. If we can completely take for granted that these people are able to somehow connect their minds through their bloodstreams, then I'm sure we can suspend our disbelief for a great many other details. And my final gripe; the dream world is surprisingly tame. I usually dream about throwing eggs from hot-air balloons, and showing up naked to classes I forgot I was supposed to be in. The people in inception seem to dream only about swanky, north side cityscapes, posh hotels and ski lodges. So...they're dreaming previous Nolan films?Alright, *breathes deep*. And now for the good things... honestly, there are a lot of spectacular moments in this film, more than enough to warrant a recommendation. The fluidity of many of the action sequences are truly remarkable in their own right and the actors do a fine job in selling the atmosphere...so, go see it. Just take note of the fact that Inception ultimately lacks a great, suspenseful, emotional hook. The concept is rich and sexy, but not exceptionally unheralded. We've had our minds ""bended"" before, now show us why we should be invested in this particular iteration. In the end, for as complexly orchestrated as the plot of Inception is there are, unfortunately, a great deal of dull edges that result in hindsight being less than 20/20.",0
"This is one of those movies who make things unnecesarily complicated in order to impress.The plot becomes more and more complicated, until you realize they are just messing with your mind.So all you care from then on is when this movie will end.The cool CGI effects are just a few minutes: the rest is just pseudo james bond style garbageA pseudointelectual movie for the pseudointelectual people",0
"Few phenomena are more fascinating than dreams. The untamed subconscious liberated from societal barriers, images of distorted reality filtered through personal fears and hopes, dreams are rich with cinematic and storytelling potential. And yet very few movies have been able to actualize their power on film. By their nature, dreams, their images and feeling, are nearly impossible to replicate in a place outside our own minds. Some geniuses have done it. Fritz Lang did it with Metropolis. Stanley Kubrick did it with Eyes Wide Shut. Alex Proyas did it with Dark City. David Lynch did it with Blue Velvet. None of those films are consciously about dreams, and yet they give, through mood and twisted imagination, the impression of experiencing a dream. Enter Christopher Nolan's Inception, a movie 100% about dreams, that is woefully inept at imagining them. Nolan takes the nebulous psycho-analytical concept of dreams in his usual literal way, presenting a vision of the untamed subconscious as boring as an international action movie.The hook of Inception is too juicy to ignore. A group of mind thieves, led by Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb, infiltrate the subconscious of a C.E.O in order to implant an idea, in an act of corporate espionage. The story is original and high-concept, two welcome adjectives for a big-budget blockbuster. A journey into dreams structured like a heist movie. It's cool. Sadly, the fabulous premise of Inception is almost completely wasted in what amounts to an unflavored Bourne-style diversion.A filmmaker with imagination could have a field day with the skeleton of Nolan's screenplay. More to the point actually, Nolan's screenplay needs a filmmaker with imagination. Christopher Nolan, for all his stellar skills as a director of giant, prestigious, filmic blockbusters, is hopelessly devoid of imagination. To promise us an entirely new cinematic world, only to end up showing the same boring cityscapes, offices and ski resorts we've seen hundreds if not thousands of times over, is unjustifiably lazy. Whatever ""dream-like"" sequences Nolan tosses out are so frivolous they might as well be ignored, because they do nothing to further the impression of experiencing a dream. So there's a train going through a city. If this is as crazy as your dreams get, I pity you. With respect, the image of the folding city carries with it some power (Hans Zimmer's ""Bwwwaaah!"" must get some of the credit for this) and the hotel sequence remains a clever and well-done special effects moment. But they are outliers in what is ostensibly a collection of grey shootouts. And I'm sorry if the gun nuts come for me, but scenes of two groups shooting machine guns at each other from behind cover are such boring ways to visualize action. Movement and surprise are the pillars of great action. A static shootout has neither. Take a risk for Christ's sake. Do something new.There is a clinical precision to everything in Inception. The movie is clenched tight, completely driven by plot and storytelling efficiency. There is not a second dedicated to artistic freedom. It is rigid, don't-break-the-rules conformity to realism. Not even in a dream, where literally anything imaginable can happen, does Nolan allow himself to go a little nuts. To show us an image that might be taken as, I don't know, weird. No, everything in Inception must be buttoned-up, dignified. No setting can be too extravagant. No performance can be too nutty. It's bad enough that Nolan turned a place called Gotham City into a glass and concrete eyesore with the visual flair of a corporate stock photo, but to turn the infinite realm of the mindscape into the same turgid grey void is borderline unacceptable. Nolan has gotten better as an artist since The Dark Knight and Inception. And I won't pretend that the films that made him a superstar are without their qualities (The Dark Knight is very good, I should mention). The left side of Christopher Nolan's brain is like an F1 engine. He is a powerhouse when it comes to the mastery of intricacies in storytelling, the managing of time, science, and plot. The right side, however, is underdeveloped to an extreme for a man of his talent. Inception is the movie where that creative part is missed most. The opportunity for transcendence was too clear for us to have been saddled with an end product so generic. Inception is safe enough to not upset the legions of film bros who worship it, but that safety comes at the expense of a vision that could actually be considered ""bold"".49/100",0
"Years ago I thought vagaries of the weighting algorithm caused this movie to appear with such a high rating. As it remained almost static in top fifty lists around the internet, I had to go back and watch it a third time. It is as if a secret Franz Kafka Philip Dick Thomas Pynchon alternate reality quest eludes me and I am failing to hear the post-horn. I remain baffled.",0
"Watched this movie two years ago, in pain, in agony, and the only thing I can remember about it is one actor and I have an idea of what's it about only because I will never forget how much I laughed when i saw South Park episode Insheeption shortly afterwards. Oh man, you don't need to look for better critic of the movie. The only reason I gave 2/10 score for this piece of garbage, is that it is actually funny. It is like a tacco within a tacco.On the other hand, I can't help but notice that many ( wanna be ) enigma, psycho-thriller moves are getting high rates even tho they lack intro, plot and outro. Does this tells of an overall intelligence of viewers of particular motion picture?",0
"In 2014, we've seen every possibility in SFX, so it should all come down to Storytelling, Character development and Credibility. So let me go into that. The story is based upon a few aspects of dreaming that the viewer can recognize: dream time passes quickly, circumstances that the dreamer is in (rain, cold, music) tend to enter the dream and you immediately wake up when killed.The story starts with these commonly known facts, which is good, highly original and promising. Then it wants us to believe a series of additional details and exceptions, that are unveiled bit by bit. Up to a point that you say ""Hey but wait a minute, do you really want me to believe this too ?"" The suspense in the film comes from the fact that this information is held back and unveiled just-in-time. Without Cobb's explanations throughout the movie no one would accept the story. Let me sum up some of the additional rules that you will have to accept in order to appreciate the plot. And the serious flaws that come with them.Rule: it's possible to enter someone else's dream. All you need is a futuristic device with old fashioned wires and a big button. You hook up four dreamers and then you press the button. One of them is the owner of the dream, the others are visitors. Because the machine is not wireless you must have all four people in the same room. But no matter how much the people are messed with, the wires hold and the machine keeps working. Rule: If you enter someone's dream, you can extract information from it. Furthermore, it's possible to insert information into the dream (hence the title 'Inception'). Much like the way people are influenced when hypnotized. Hey, wait a minute, wouldn't hypnosis be a much easier way to achieve the same amount of influencing? With much less danger to the villain (Cobb) too. Rule: It is possible to work out a scenario beforehand and take it into the dream, thus creating a dream that follows a script. But the worlds that are created in the dream are nothing like dreams as we know them. The dreams in Inception look more like worlds from a modern fantasy-movie. There's much emphasis on Ariadne's ability to create labyrinths in the dreams, yet none of the dreamworlds actually is a labyrinth and it's not clear why they must be. Therefore it's unclear why Ariadne, being a constant nuisance, is taken into the dreams. Her only justification in the script is that Cobb needs a reason to keep explaining everything. So, in short, she impersonates the viewer. In that case it would be smart to make her more likable.Rule: In the dreams, it's possible to have a similar device to enter dreams. Creating a dream within a dream within a dream. But, in a deeper level dream, some of the above rules do not apply. For instance, if you are killed in a second level dream, you will not wake up, you will remain 'down there'. On the other hand, in many scenes people's lives are being threatened and they never seem to worry. The other rule that does not always seem to apply is the fact that the dreamer's circumstances are taken into the dream. For instance: if the dreamer is sitting in the back of a van and the van falls from a bridge, the weightlessness caused by the fall becomes a factor in the dream. So,the four people in the dream (the hotel-scene) become weightless. But the dream of these weightless people does NOT become weightless. This happens many times (when bouncing and shaking because their seat is tossed around, etc) and is totally inconsistent. If the people are freezing, their dream is not influenced. But if they are getting wet, the dream is influenced. Please, it does not need to be logical, as long as it's consistent.Rule: if there are more characters in someone's dream, they are hostile towards the people who entered the dream. Even worse, some people (Mal) are so hostile that they keep entering dreams in order to try to kill everyone. This has you on the edge of your seat, until you think 'why?'Rule: It is important to know whether you're dreaming. Therefore you must bring a 'totem' into your dream with which you can test if you're dreaming. All characters take a 'totem' but you never see anyone actually use it. It is unclear why Cobb tells Ariadne not to show her 'totem' but does demonstrate his own.Rule: After the dream is over, you remember nothing. Except for the one thing that Cobb wants you to remember. Rule: time spent in a dream is twenty times the length of the dream. This is important, because if you have a four hour airplane flight, it gives you eighty hours of working time in the dream. But an important part of the story is in the second level dream (the weightless hotel scene), all of which is within the time frame of the van dropping off of the edge of a bridge. A real drop would take about three seconds. So the time spent in the hotel is one minute. In the hotel and elevator we see half an hour of action at least. These are the major flaws. There are numerous other errors in the script (if the city is folded up, why does the light not change?) so the only way to enjoy this movie is to not think and just enjoy the graphics. The only factor that carries the story is the brilliant level of acting from DiCaprio and Page. This and the SFX are the only reasons to reward this highly overrated movie with a 5.",0
"This is a nice action-flick. Entertaining and well made. Now it is supposed to be about dreams. This should be a treat for all those of us who treasure Kafka or H.P. Lovecraft, right? Ever had a lucid dream? Now this will be awesome! ... Or perhaps not. What is presented here is no more a dream than James Bond so to speak. It's not actually surreal. The whole ""diving into a dream"" thing comes down to a couple of ""rules"" to follow plus some FX. The FX are well done actually. That alone would probably alleviate this film beyond the likes of ""The Day after Tomorrow"" or ""2012"" - it's everything else that ruins it. In any case Dream is just fantasy here. Any film delivers that much. It's just cheesy to have this scenario ""in a persons dream"". Ultimately the whole dream thing is just a facade to have the plot jump from here to there without actually creating a meaningful connection. At least this concept allows the film to have everything at once and offer even more than zapping through the best channels on prime time.",0
"Inception is a great concept for a film. And the special effects in it are among the best ever created for any film. But special effects alone cannot compensate for weaknesses in a plot or story. And there are several weaknesses in the plot and story. One is the believability that corporations are evil entities striving to achieve world dominance and stealing anything they can from the competition. While this might be true of one or two minor companies, major multinationals could never afford the bad PR associated with such actions; and so it is not within the realm of believability for over 99% of the multinationals out there. DiCaprio is not bad, and the supporting cast gives it the college try, but no cigar from the classic film school. You have to have a believable story to match your great special effects and a good idea.",0
There are a lot of scenes which are very similar with an anime from the 90s which i did not remember.,0
"A blockbuster, star studded extravaganza with a somewhat imaginative yet an overwhelmingly more confusing and contrived premise. The audience is expected to enter this contrived sci-fi?, dream world where Juno is able to architect dreams (why her character I didn't pick up), and Leo's character can extract information or do the more complicated thing of putting an idea into someones mind ""inception"". Continuously saturated with fun, ""A""list actors one after another; Leo, Michael Caine, Juno, Joseph Gordan-Levitt, Ken Watanabe these actors were used as mere tools to create a blockbuster and drive the movie forward. As we get more and more immersed in the world of inception we feel no interesting characterizations despite all this acting talent, everyone is one tone, which makes you care less whether or not Leo is still dreaming at the end or not. After this matrixy like premise is explained, we are transported into this world, of entering and altering people's subconscious in dreamland. It has similar overtones to the Matrix (of heavily explaining ulterior worlds within our own), but this premise was far less fascinating.After the complicated premise is established the movie gets into the story. Leo has powers to extract information or alter someone's thinking by entering another individual's subconscious dreamworld. He gets an assignment from a powerful mogul to exploit and alter a competitor's mind through his dream. If Leo succeeds he gets to travel back to the states where he has been deported. The movie did not do a good job connecting the premise of how people enter dreams and plant ideas to the story. OK so this idea of conducting inception in dream world is established but does it have to get into 3-4 dream sequences? Its more complicated to do inception than steal info out of someones mind so something more has to be done than getting into people's minds on one level but confusingly layering dreams within dreams within dreams, confusing establishing various rules with this more complicated inception world (I barely understood the easier stealing info world), confusingly adding side stories of his wife he doesn't want to let go of and therefore retains in his personal dream and making confusing action and fighting (who they are fighting is also part of the puzzle) made it much too much. These things are actually explained but they are explained so briefly and rapidly along with many other ""rules"" we have to accept that it became a lot, easy to miss and not well put together. More than imagination it was randomness....Why 3 levels why not 8 or 2 why does it have to be 3 levels (the movie I think explained this but what Im critical of is the imaginative part, it was just too random to get really into), if Juno can flip the grid of Paris why cant she do something to make it easy for them to accomplish their goal. The limitations or freedoms were not clear. What it utlimately came down to was an action movie. Definitely after a second viewing the pieces may more clearly fit, but for me at least, the puzzle will remain askew.",0
"""THE BOX"" = ""INCEPTION"" People that says it all.Following a lot of swearing words that IMDb doesn't let me to write i was an one more unethically forced victim of the reviews that i presume that direction of movie paid for all those people to write positive comments and guess what giving a 10? and calling a masterpiece to this Ultimate Nightmare Gangrene.You Must Be Shiting Me.This is the No one WILL NEVER SEE THE END MOVIE OF THE WHOLE CENTURY .This is the real Neverending story.If there's a little brain left in your head people stay away!!!This is the hyper money sucking utter trash ever made in human history.God Mercy us from now and on this is indication of what level of insanity human race managed to get and be thankful for.This is the 60 min sleeping alert from the 2 hours and a half that whole movie takes long to finish.After the first 45-60min you will be dreaming your worst nightmare Mr Nolan's or whatever directors name is dreams with filling his pockets with your money Thats all about this movie that left in my brain.I Don't WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE THE WORDS IN MY LIFE ""DREAMING"" OR ""DREAMS"" OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS MOVIE.You must be really smart to watch this movie @-@!!!

Too much blasphemy, taking the Lord's name in vain, the characters are annoying & unlikable, they needed better writing. And who has ever had a dream, in a dream, in a dream, in a dream, in a dream...???

"I'm tired of hearing everybody say how original INCEPTION was. The dream concept has been going on for decades before Mr.Nolan even had the ""genius idea"" of Inception. Being a woman, the first time I watched Inception, I went along with all the cliché James Bond scenes (remember the skis and the guns of -The Spy Who Loved Me-?) and the over dramatic acting because of DiCaprio's facade. The second time I watched it however, the defects of the movie became apparent. The second time I watched the movie, I became disappointed. Believe me when I say I wished I shouldn't have done so. With the power invested in me by IMDb I graded Inception with a five out of ten because, setting aside the fact that the movie was a copycat of so many other projects, Mr.Nolan did a beautiful job with the scenery.",0
"Inception was okay steals from Total Recall, The Matrix, James Bond, Paprika and Vanilla Sky.Christopher Nolan made the story confusing and added as many action scenes as possible so you won't want to work out what was going on. The characters were all one dimensional and I didn't care for any one. If you liked The Matrix then this is for you.Dream within a dream stuff was all too much for me, the same people running around at the same time very challenging to keep track of the story, the premise was all too confusing for me.Five minutes in real life is an hour in dream time and a dream within a dream can be a lifetime oh stop! I can take it any more.I say just forget the story enjoy the set pieces, the special effects and the riveting action. Forget about character development there is none.Always nice to see Ellen Page she's a great little actress shame she was given nothing to do. Nothing new about this concept. I would give it 5 out of ten and that's just because the action was cool.",0

"Picked two films with very high ratings as possibilities to go see: Dicaprio's Inception with a very high rating (9 stars) and another film, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World with an incredible 10 stars. The Pilgrim movie seemed to be a bit young for me (about a guy in a band having to deal with a girl's evil ex-boyfriends in order to date her) so I plumped for Inception which is Sci-Fi and which I usually like.I lasted about 30 minutes in Inception. It was trying too hard and delivering nothing. Starting off with 3 dream-in-a-dream sequences, mediocre acting, and non-existent dialogue, it got progressively worse. I didn't stick around, been there, done that. Luckily for me, I walked into the Scott Pilgrim movie in-progress and saw a very different and funny movie. Yeah, it's juvenile but hilarious. A takeoff on bands, anime, gaming, and young love in general. The casting/acting was impeccable for a no-name film and the script made me chuckle through-out. If there weren't so many gay jokes, I'd take my kids to see it. Even if you aren't into computer games, you may appreciate a lot of the humor. Kids should love it.Best thing of all, it was more than payback for having to sit through part of Inception, :^)",0
"Very disappointed in this movie, thought it would be good, but to me it was just a run of the mill thriller, which was more concerned to produce thrills and violence than play around and delve into a very interesting theme. It makes me quite sad to see this movie is one of the highest ranking movies, it shows the mindless thrills that the general public have come to believe is what a good movie is all about; the movie was like this because that's what the people want. Could have been really interesting, could have been so many things, but the movie seemed more interested in trying to get as many shootings and face punching as possible. It seems nearly all popular movies have to have these ingredients or they can not be popular, sad.",0
"Inception is an entertaining, mind blowing summer blockbuster which I thought was average.This is about a thief who has the ability to access someone's dreams and steal info from them. After, he goes on one final mission, it becomes complicated as an outside force attempts to stop him and his team.This is a mostly astonishing film. It requires the audience to remain on the edge of their seats in its entirety. Many modern summer blockbusters are thoughtless and hollow. It's great to see something of its complexity come out this time of the year. It's real refreshing.The action is magnificent. It's done in a great way and the movie utilizes the dreams to make truly visually spectacular scenes. Some of the best scenes include the zero gravity fight in the hallway and the van falling into the river in slow motion.Although it's easy to get lost in Inception's plot, Christopher Nolan doesn't expect you to understand every element of this film. You just have to understand that this is a movie you have to watch again. But it's plot is handled with meticulous care.But this movie isn't the best with character development. At first I was going to ignore this but now that I think of it - what exactly do we know about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character? Most of the other characters were pushed aside and we didn't get any time to connect with them emotionally. The film also had pacing issues as its opening took a while to pick up.Also, a couple of the rules didn't make sense. For instance, the kick. How come no one was woken up after their van was rammed off the road, flipped over several times, and came to a crashing stop below? Also, the introduction of limbo felt pointless. So, if you die in a dream, you end up in limbo. However, if you die in limbo, you wind up back in the dream. What's the threat of going into limbo then?In conclusion, I thought it was alright. It has nice action scenes and a complicated plot. However, I don't think that it's anything else than a good sci-fi/action flick with a few flaws.",0
"This whole movie can be summed up in one phrase: ""The playa got played.""I've seen the gamut in these reviews from raves to rants. And the truth is, ironically, the same point as the movie: You make your own reality. Like the example I've used so often from Antoine de St Exupery, Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) ""Did the sheep eat the rose? Did you create holes in the box?""The elements are all present to make this a wonderful movie of your OWN interpretation. But if you wait for someone else to put the glitter and paint together you'll be disappointed. On the surface we have a mess of provocative ideas, many conflicting, but you can still add your own interpretation that takes the film as given, cheap sophistry with shoot 'em up action scenes, and turns it into something special like the old board game with so many alternate endings.

"Inception at first appears to be a great movie. A visual masterpiece of the highest order, but in reality it is a terrible film. The cracks appear to show. In close analysis. I will be going thru pros and cons.
Pros: The movie has excellent cast, and directing. I loved each of the actor's performances. The visuals were splendid.
Cons:The film doesn't make sense, and is confusing. How does entering a person's dream within a dream work? I understand Leonardo and Joseph have dream entering technology, but how would you fall asleep within a dream? It would have worked if they entered each other's consciousness thru a brain implant. The brain implant allowed for that kind telepathy. No one falls asleep within a dream. I'm sorry to say this, but it is bit pretentious.
Inception is a confusing pretentious film.",0

"It is shocking to me sometimes to sit and watch these kind of movies. for starters, it's obvious that the only thing the script writers could think of is the dream concept, nothing more. so, if you have one idea, why not use it over and over till every one thinks it's clever? so the story is basically about a guy going into another guy's dream, then into a dream within a dream, then into a dream within a dream then - you guessed it. it's not smart, and without it, i doubt they could have gotten more then an hour out of this story line, but add the ""awsome complexity"" (for a 2 year old monkey) of a dream within a dream and they got a 2 and a half!! hour movie.now to the acting - doesn't exist, sorry. some how, Leonardo D gets more movies although he can't act. the side kicks next to him learned the trade quite fast and they too don't believe in acting. in fact, the only acting you get through out the movie is when you see the extras, they were great. why not shoot leonardo and replace him with one of the extras? good questionthat being said, i would recommend watching it once, for the effects and shooting, that's all this movie is good for. and please, don't think it's a smart movie, that only makes you look like an idiot",0

Hans did an incredible score which empowers the feelings and action of the movie. The sound effects are extremely good too.7. The ending is absolutely brilliant and heart-attack.8. Direction. All it's extremely well executed and consistent. All. Each detail matters. I have no words.Inception is a masterpiece. Nolan's best creation with no doubt and one of the best films I've seen in 10 years ( the previous one was Matrix in 1999 ). This movie is a ""must see several times"". I'm sure it will rock the Oscars of 2010 and it will be a box-office success.10 of 10, perfect movie ( and, trust me, I don't say all the days ).",0
"Visually, INCEPTION is rich, although some images tend to become repetitive in this overlong film.
It boasts a star-laden cast: di Caprio, Hardy, Cotillard, Caine, Postlethwaite, and many other greats in small roles. Yet, there is not a single great piece of acting in it.
The script is full of twists, play on the third dimension, time, and all kinds of theories, but in the end... it has no idea how to end. It goes on and on, mostly in slow motion.
What was the secret sought in the vault? Was ""disappointed"" a synonym for CITIZEN KANE's ""Rosebud""?
In a nutshell, that is how pretentious and hollow INCEPTION is.
A waste of talent.",0
"I thought this was super cool when it came out. Definitely enjoyed some rewatches & started thinking ""okay, maybe my favourite parts are the rotating hallway parts"". But the other evening I watched it on mute.
A good movie should make sense with no picture, and also with no sound. This is not the intended film experience, obviously, but it speaks to how each element has to stand on it's own. Okay? We're all good?
I dare you to watch this on mute & not feel incredibly bored. What are we doing? I swear this man enjoys directing actors less than George Lucas. Ledger's Joker is an anomaly, in that it was such a committed performance, but than you have to consider how the entire production ignored Ledger's health issues. Where is the love? I don't think Nolan likes directing actors at all. The only clever concepts in his films seem to come from his brother. But it would appear that Nolan identifies as a clever film maker. Or high-brow. This is not 'Solaris'.
What do I like about this film? ...the spinny bits. But that's Fred Astaire's thing! This is not an original concept. The only commendable aspect to any Nolan film is his high level commitment to practical effects. I truly love those aspects. This film had some gorgeous miniatures to establish locations I couldn't care less about.
So yeah... good movie for a 15 year old who's getting into film. This is not high brow it's just noodling around with concepts while dudes in suits punch each other. I hope you enjoy it because I hope people enjoy things, but I have to say I did not enjoy it upon rewatch.",0
"This movie has received tons of hype, a little to much the Academy award it won are from the extravaganza editing and effects, the most redeeming factor of the movie are also the cinematography and effects. The plot line is really just confusing and messy, it makes the viewer think to much. It is to open ended and does not satisfy the viewer, it goes to deep into the levels of dream which makes the main story line sink away as the viewers mind is focused on sorting the complex and messy scripting. A confusing movie .",0

"I was waiting for it to end after an hour and a half and it didn't come soon enough.Boring film that seems to think its clever yet has no thought provoking elements. I love DiCaprio normally but he was definitely wasted on this film. How does this get such a good rating?? Realistically it probably about a 5 out of 10 but I gave it a 1 for all the flattering ratings it must have got to be in the top 10 films.I am typing this sentence to make it up to the 10 lines minimum as I haven't got anymore to say about this film.All in all, the dream in a dream in a dream stuff really is boring and they managed to make a good idea into a bad film.",0
"Many things have already been said concerning ""Inception,"" so I'm going to keep this short and focus on some things I haven't seen mentioned yet..The acting is flat-out incredible, with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio. Comparison with Keanu Reeves is becoming inevitable, what with Leonardo's ""I can only look angry and confused""-style of acting. Fortunately, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt give such an impressive performance that for once, I couldn't be bothered by Leonardo's one-sidedness. Hardy in particular is a force of nature, with perfect timing, inflection, emotion and humor. He's amazing.This movie leaves pretty much the whole plot open to the viewer's imagination, which I find very appropriate taking in regard the subject matter. The theories about this movie are diverse, which makes this a powerful film even if you didn't enjoy it. It's food for thought, it's entertaining, it's good, it's visually stunning. I urge every film lover to watch this.",0
"Very bad story telling of a not very complicated film. All the best scenes were in the trailer. It was really just a boring action film. I can't believe it took him 10 years to write such a simple yet disjointed story. Also the characters (Hardy, Levitt etc ) had no back stories. Hardy just appeared and could do stuff like change appearance!...Ridiculous",0
"Nothing but special effects, boring plot, and lame acting. I will never see this silly film again. Save time and money and watch
""Dark City"" instead!!!",0
"And so, the inevitable: Paprika vs. Inception. Really? You didn't see that coming? A lot of people seem to think this movie is wonderful. It has star power, I suppose, and a lot of people like stars. To me, it looked like half a dozen Japanese animes slapped together into an incomprehensible mishmash mess, combined with some thinky dialog that supposedly glues it all together. Crap, in other words. I read the Wikipedia article on this movie, just to make sure I didn't miss some profound thing that would change my mind. Even the article was dull and uninspiring...I read the first and last paragraph, and that was a chore. I'm not picky...if I'm entertained, I'm happy, even if the plot/acting/whatever sucks. I'm sure the acting was great, the special effects were awesome, and the key grip showed others how it's done. I just couldn't get in to this movie. I didn't care if the main characters lived or died, I didn't care if the McGuffin got got, and I didn't care if the stupid top fell over. Despite Hollywood's slobbering over this movie, you might notice nobody bothered to make a sequel or otherwise capitalize on its greatness. Was that because they didn't want to defile its artistic purity? Um, not likely. It's trash, and Tokyo knows it.",0
"So basically why would you leave the ending like this, like mans here thinking omg the spinning thing is gonna drop because it's wobbling and then you have the audacity to cut the damn sceen

"The most FLAWED thing that destroys the whole plot Is the sick twisted wife.
Why? Because She clearly shows incredible self destructive delusions of grandeur. She is truly a maniac and really dangerous.
So the story doesnt work. If Decaprio's character had notice these behaviours he would have left with the kids long time ago. And she would have been on heavy meds. On a psychiatric treatment.
It doesnt matter if they lived in a dream for 50 years. When the partner you love showing these kinds of aggressive behaviour you run!
Cause 80% of the Main story is about the wife drama, it just doesnt work.",0

"When I saw all the ratings and reviews of this film I was not sure do I like it or not. Well, some things I did, others I did not.I constantly had a feeling that plot is not really there. Or if it was there it was put behind all the action and visual and special effects, with what this film abounds. I have to say that I was very impressed with that part(s) of this film. I just would like that not all of it I could predict.Acting is excellent, but what else do you expect from a crew of actors in a film like this? I could not loose any sleep for not recommending this film. If you are into this type of films then you should see it. If you would like me to describe it in a few words then it would be: Pale copy of Matrix.",0
"I think my biggest issue with this film was, to me, the dreams weren't very realistic. In a sense that, when I dream, they're nothing like it is depicted in the film. This annoyed me! The dream sequences are very Hollywood stylized.Don't get my wrong, the acting in this film is superb, with names like Leo Decaprio & Joseph Gordan of course it would be. The special effects are also quite incredible.If you want to watch something that, in my opinion, realistically depicts how we actually dream. Give Joss Wheadon's take on it a look. Its spot on in Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Season 4, Episode 22 : Restess.I gave it a 6 as it is a well written and well executed film. Great if you want to watch something that will make you think long after.",0
"The first time I watched this movie, I turned it off about 15 minutes into it. I never even reviewed it or gave it any stars because I didn't think it would be fair to review a movie I hadn't seen.I turned it off because I thought it was full of nothing but weird, pointless action sequences that fell back on the cliché deux-ex-machina: ""And they woke up, and it was all a dream.""After taking the time to watch it (all two and a half hours), I now feel I can give it a review.I'm giving it five stars because it's not a bad movie, but it's not a great movie either. I can think of several ways this movie can be improved:1. Starting off from the viewpoint of someone who is just beginning to understand the dream tech. The new architect - whatshername (sorry, bad with names) - is a great choice. She is practically the only strong female character in this movie, so having it from her point of view would help the female audience feel more connected to the storyline in a movie full of male characters. 2. Set clear boundaries. One reason the Matrix had universal appeal and this movie doesn't, is because it had clear boundaries about what the Matrix is and what it is not. Through the eyes of Neo, the audience could learn what was real and what was simulation and how the technology worked. Inception, on the other hand, thrusts the viewer into scene after scene of dreams within dreams within a futuristic reality with no understanding of what is going on or how it is working. Only through bits and pieces can the audience deduce how things work.3. The technology is ridiculous. Sorry but it is. The whole ""needle in the arm"" seems like a cop out. Why not put some effort into it, like make it something that looks like an mp3 player that can hook up to the briefcase thingy to share dreams - the earbuds could be acoustics that translate into brainwaves via sound to receive and transmit dream data. Now THAT would make it more relatable to the audience. Most everyone has had a walkman, a portable cd player or an mp3 player.4. The storyline needs more than one movie. It is incredibly complex and could have been told in at least two movies, taking time so the audience can fully appreciate the concept of the movie and the main character's struggle with his wife's death. Inception is smart and unique and it's a shame that not enough effort went into making it more approachable to the average person. This could have easily rivaled the Matrix as a trilogy, and given people a lot more to talk about than to argue about who is smarter than who based on if they liked a movie or not. Done right, it could have opened an entire dialog about human perception instead.",0
"Inception (2010), written and directed by Christopher Nolan, takes us through a wild ride of exciting and intriguing action, while at the same time pulling at our heart strings with a confusing and unconventional love story. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, possesses a unique ability to extract information from someone's mind while they are dreaming. This ability has put him in a compromising position and brings him to one final mission that is Inception. Cobb is approached by Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe), to implant an idea into the mind of Robert Michael Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy), the young heir of a business empire. Upon completion of this job, Cobb will get back the life he has lost. Cobb must employ the help of his partner, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); associate, Eames (Tom Hardy); and highly recommended architectural student, Ariadne (Ellen Page) to complete a task that is thought to be impossible. The crew encounters a barrage of obstacles, but one in particular wreaks havoc they never expected.The theme of this movie demonstrates a focus on the complexity of human relationships. Not only does it show the yearning and thirst for love between Cobb and his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), but it shows the value and difficulties of having confidence and trust in others. As the crew begins their descent further into the dream world, they soon learn the value of trust. Their journey starts with an ambush by their subject's subconscious. This is their first lesson in trust. The group trusted Arthur to conduct proper research of their subject's history, background, and knowledge of dream infiltration. Not long after, the group is shocked to discover that their mission is even more dangerous than anticipated. Cobb fails to tell them that if things go wrong they could be stuck in the dream world for decades.Perhaps one of the most valuable off-screen elements of this movie is the soundtrack, written by Hans Zimmer. Nominated for an Academy Award in 2011, the powerful sounds match up perfectly with every scene, intensifying as the drama does. The majority of it intended to mimic Cobb's feelings throughout the film; the viewer is able to connect with the emotional states of longing and desperation that Cobb has.Nolan also takes advantage of special effects to enhance visual stimulation and to make the viewer feel like they really understand the concept of living in a dream. When Ariadne is first introduced to the dream world, she lets her imagination run wild. We see scenes of a busy city folding in half, moving bridges, and walls made of mirrors representing the metaphor of our dreams having endless possibilities.Inception is both exciting and intriguing to the viewer. Both cinematic effects and off-screen contributions bring a special addition to the development of the theme. Although slightly outdone by the special effects, the theme represents an excellent example of the complexities in human relationships.",0
"Normally, I never review movies, as I feel most reviews are written either by shills or psychos, of which I am neither. However, this movie planted an idea in my head that it was a really great movie. It was like a dream, and since its inception I have been compelled to write something wonderful about it. I find this to be fascinating, since my memory of the movie was that of a Vanilla Sky / Dark City swirl as one might see by flushing both down a drain, which I have also been compelled to do but have thus far resisted.You ask, ""but what does this mean?"" I answer, ""if you must seek out the meaning, then you have missed the point."" I feel compelled to give this answer as I feel compelled to relive memories of my dear dead wife, who is actually very much alive and sat next to me in the IMAX theater, protecting her ears from the 12,000 watts of audio this movie cranked out with impunity.That is my review, hardly one of either a shill or a psycho, as I have told you nothing about the movie, except, perhaps, how compelled I was to write about it. I gave the movie a 50, because I neither endorse or deride it. However, I do feel compelled to say it was the single greatest work of art since the Creation, but that is just my idea and, for the life of me, do not know where I got it.",0
"David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that ""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I'm sure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something that is as powerful inside as it is outside.",0
"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough.",0
"So. It flirts a bit with the ideals of anti-conformism and anti-corporate (a bit hypocritical considering a corporate made this movie, but let's pretend otherwise), and then offers as a solution a gang of people meeting up to beat up each other. Like ""to hell with this system, we'll make a super gang of fighters and take over!"". And then what? I see people rebelling but without any goal or project beside rebelling. ""We are tired of this system, we make gangs and beat up corporates!"" I won't even go into the plot flaws of the protagonist etc because that's be too easy.A movie for losers with a lot of passive aggressiveness inside and no solution for it, they just want to rebel. A movie for people who will go all ""eff the system!"" and then buy iPhone 17 on first day, just to complain the following day about their low- paying job. A movie for those typical guys who talk crap about capitalism but if you try to offer them a different system they'll dirty their pants and start sucking their fingers calling mom State to save them from the terrorist. A movie for those who are all rebellious and when stopped by police will go all ""G-Good afternoon Agent"" and sh*t their pants.",0
"Although this film was watchable for the first hour or so, it goes very rapidly downhill for the sorry remainder of it's duration. There are simply too many different ideas vying for the viewers attention. Intellectuals have found acres and acres of meaning, which David Fincher wanted them too, although he knows that he has simply made an extremely pretentious and boring mess. It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some very good set pieces in the first half of the film that actually entertained me for a while.",0
"Please.This is a dismal movie.  I'm going to spoil some stuff, so don't read if you don't want, but read on if you want to save some time and money.
After I sat through this abomination, I knew I'd come on here and see that it got great reviews, because it tried to be so artsy that weak-minded people would say they liked it just to try to convince themselves that they have advanced taste.  Midway through I told myself that if I heard that ""I am Jake's this and that"" line again I would get up and leave, but sure enough I kept hearing it and I stayed.  Maybe I'm as dumb as the filmmakers. The fact of the matter is that I haven't seen a plot this full of holes since ""Slugs"".  So if I start a fight club, the participants will just start showing up at my doorstep out of the blue and turn into mind-numbed drones that do my evil bidding???  Not only that, but this movie also taught me that if I stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger, not only will I live but I'll be able to talk to people in my normal voice, as long as I put a gauze pad on it.If you still don't know, this movie is about a clinically-depressed guy who's search for therapy leads him to Brad Pitt, who teaches him that beating the bejeezus out of people will brighten his spirits.  More guys find out about this, and they all join the ""fight club"" and then naturally go live with Pitt to become his evil minions.  Of course! This must be how the Wicked Witch found all those monkeys.  Their evil deeds get worse and worse, and the supposedly still-sane Norton inexplicably keeps hanging out with this bunch.  This leads to one totally inane scene where the evil monkeys return from a gunfight with one of their members dead, and all Norton can do is whine ""C'mon guys, cut it out"".So after this movie backs itself into a miserable corner, it's only escape is the equally awful ""It was all a dream"" ending, where we find out that Brad Pitt was just Norton's evil imaginary friend, and that Norton had been committing all these acts himself.  Please audience, forget the fact that the ""imaginary"" Pitt managed to pull Norton from a burning car wreck and pick him up off the ground and hurl him down a flight of stairs.  I don't care how psycho you are, your imaginary friend cannot physically pick you up.Plot hole #9233 asks us to believe that during this short time, Norton had been in EVERY MAJOR CITY in the US forming more armies of mind-numbed robot monkeys, and that every male over the age of 18 in the United States was now a member of his ""secret"" evil gang.  So anyhow, Norton finally realizes that he's been crazy all this time, and to kill Pitt he sticks a gun in his own mouth and blows his neck off, a wound which apparently isn't as debilitating as you would think, since he manages to get right up and make up with his girlfriend and watch peacefully as his evil plot comes to fruition.  But wait, you thought he was sane now and would be horrified at what he did? So would I, but that apparently also is not the case.Before you typically think that my movie tastes aren't as cultured as yours, let me tell you that I loved the masterpiece that was ""A Clockwork Orange"", and this movie was NO ""Clockwork"".  If Clockwork ended by telling you that the old man in the wheelchair was actually the killer and that McDowell was just his evil imagination, then we'd have a comparison, but Kubrick wasn't that horribly stupid.I am Jake's bad movie review.",0
"In short, Fight Club is a movie that attempts to give a distorted portrait of society as an evil in order to facilitate showing violence and yet more violence. But since the protagonist's disbelief in society is not substantiated, the movie has a hard time explaining the destruction plot. So, time has to be spent watching people fight. And of course, the disbelief cannot be motivated: The protagonist complaining that: ""God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas ... We have no Great War. No Great Depression."" is both romanticizing over events in Western history, that made absolutely no sense to the people living it, and at the same time mocking our grandparents and the life and society they fought for, ours.The main character continues: ""We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't"".Well, learning to differentiate between yourself and ""movie gods [and] rock stars"" and learning that life is not all beer and skittles is what growing up is about today.So, Brad Pitt et al., grow up. And go read a book or something.The rubbish quote sums it up pretty good: ""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men that have ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas or waiting tables; slaves with white collars. We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy s**t we don't need. We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off. """,0
"Fight  Club  begins  with  a  promising  half  hour  and  falls  downhill from  there . Edward  Norton  gives  a  brilliant  performance  as  a depressed  office  worker  driven  by  capitalism . He  narrates  the film , guiding  us  through  his  pathetic  and  hopeless  life . I  was immediately  taken  in  by  the  movie's  slick  visual  style , and Norton's  performance  is  especially  convincing . It  is  here  the movie begins  to  crumble . Funny  how  it's  possible  to  pinpoint  the exact moment  when  it  starts  to  turn  sour . It  is  when  Norton  meets Brad Pitt's  character  on  an  airplane . He's  a  neo-facist  who  teaches self-liberation  through  violence . Norton  is  intrigued  and  joins his group  of  recruits  who  act  out  their  rage  by  pounding  on  each other  in  dark  cellars . Once  Norton  moves  in  with  Pitt  the  movie begins  to  pander  and  get  off  track . It  becomes  more  like watching a  very  bloody  remake  of  The  Odd  Couple . I  was  still  hopeful though , until  the  film  self-destructs  with  a  contrived  suprise ending  that's  totally  contradictory  to  many  of  its  earlier  events . The  suprise  endings  of  Magnolia  and  The  Sixth  Sense  worked , because  they  interlocked  with  their  themes , but  the  ending  in Fight  Club  looks  like  it  was  added  on  just  to  give  it  a  kick . Then  there's  the  final  scene ,  which  is  illogical  and  serves only as  a  cop-out , as  the  movie  ducks  responsibility  to  its  real theme , Norton's  unstable  mental  condition . The  material  was  here  for  a compelling  film , but  Fight  Club  never  explores  it . Instead , it falls  into  standard , formulized  Hollywood  mush . Seeing  Fight  Club , I  realized  you  can  have  great  ideas  for  films , but  unless  you use  them  well , and  find  just  the  right  note , great  ideas  do not necessarily  make  great  movies .",0
"How can we get Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Meatloaf to beat the c**p out of each other?  This movie solves that ""problem,"" and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedo-philosophies and violence.It's just dumb.  Don't try looking beneath the surface, because nothing is there (maybe that's the point).  It provides that men are imasculated and shackled by modern life...  their spirits crushed by their jobs and their possessions.  In order to escape, you fight.  It's so simple!  Give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black t-shirt fight gang.  Makes sense.  Teenage males will certainly think so, since it is filmed in the MTV style...  bright color palette, fancy edits, blood... mesmerizing (and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic).It actually starts our promisingly.  I loved the first quarter.  Only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are, sorry, far out of the grasp of the writers, does it fail.Film buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest, tacked-on ""surprise"" endings in cinema history.  I could only laugh.  Bottom line: Dumb.",0
"SPOILER!!! This is one of a few movies overrated by wanna-be intellectuals. The script is slick in that it disguises its propaganda. Propaganda you ask? Lets start off with the FACT that Edward Norton's character in this movie is psychotic and Brad Pitt's doesn't exist. Brad Pitt's character Tyler Durden is a figment of Norton's imagination because Norton's character is psychotic. This whole plot twist becomes even more aggravating when you realized you wasted over two hours watching a movie about a psychotic anarchist. The movie's message is great for impressionable kids; the system is against you so how to succeed is through violence in some cases terrorism. Please, spare me the rhetoric. I realize the movie is fiction but it does not excuse it. Even fiction should entertain; this just drags you down into the sewer and gives impressionable misguided kids bad ideas. Sort of what the Clock Work Orange did for racists and neo-Nazis.The people who watch this need to realize that for every person or corporation in society that is corrupt there are a large magnitude of corporations and people that are not. Society in general and Capitalism are not bad. Far from it, in society today whatever is bad is used as propaganda to generalize everything as bad. This movie does the same. It conveniently keeps out any opposing arguments for its purpose. Which is to portray sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and then attempt to make it seem intelligent, instead of what it really is - insanity. Capitalism is what has given the west it's high standard of living and life expectancy. No other economic system offers this prosperity.People are always searching for tips in life or tricks they could use because they do not have an imagination themselves. Movies like this are candy to someone with no imagination. Forensic science could easily determine if someone beat himself up or whether your boss did but then you blow the plot of this whole movie because where would Norton's character get all his funding? Instead some will feel they have a ""new"" way to black mail their boss, how pathetic. So much of the movie is laughable when you analyze it. Did I mention Tyler Durden, I mean Edward Norton's character intimidates a mobster? Please.This movie attempts to be smart and that is why it fails. Smart people do not punch themselves until they bleed, live in abandoned decrepit buildings or perform terrorist acts. Smart people also do not waste their time watching dumb movies like this over and over. They read books, go to college and learn how things really work. The fact that movies like this are popular is a sign society is failing.",0
"I really didn't enjoy this film at all & I fall into the target group (male 20-30). 2/10 I'd give this.There seems a belief too that anyone who doesn't enjoy it is either thick, against violence or especially 'doesn't get the message behind it'. Well, none of those apply to me.In this flawed film, I understand that it was any of: a)a group of young men rebelling against a Borgeousie consumerism society. b)one man seeing how he is totally dissatisfied with life and how his mind tries to change things or c)people stopping to watch Cornelius fight himself because voyeurism is human nature the film makes a deliberate attempt to make the viewer feel guilty for being a voyeur. (I'll come to that later)You can take your pick really, whatever way, I still find it crap. Any film (Shawshank Redmeption excepted) which concerns 'one mans' anything, generally creates no emotion in me other than boredom. The whole tagline to the film makes me want to puke: ""one 30 year old man's journey of self-discovery.""So what? Are we supposed to sympathise with Norton because of this? I'm sorry but I have sympathy in films with people dying, or who's family have been killed. John Hurt triumphing over cancer in Champions, Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan, thousands of others. Even Norton himself actually in the brilliant American History X. In the 2nd half, I sympathise with him for the life he has found himself with.But in this (and I find myself saying the same as I did with the equally awful American Beauty) Just because some blokes fed up & having a midlife crisis we're supposed to feel for him. Oh diddums. The only film where this premise has worked brilliantly is 'It's a Wonderful Life' with James Stewart. He was in crisis (and justifyably too) but never resorted to any of the levels stooped to here.(That might seem a weak point, but It's just come to me & I can't put my finger on exactly why Wonderful Life is so far superior to Fight Club in tackling a midlife crisis, but they are as far extreme as you can get)
I'd also question whether we're all voyers? For every moron that slows down on a motorway to look at an accident on the other side, there's a 100 or so that can't believe the stupidity of it.There are countless flaws too. The scene prior to the car crash wouldn't have worked? Who was Norton talking to? with the passengers there? Where did he acquire his knowledge of soap from? Would people have watched 1 bloke fighting himself? and much more too. Ok, maybe one or 2 of those have answers but I couldn't find them.I think to really enjoy this film, you have to have clicked or empathised with the main character, and if you did, I feel a bit sorry for you. It would however account for the popularity of such things as marriage guidance councillors, drugs, footballers agents, even to a degree religion (but only when it becomes absolutely fanatical & life revolves around it).
Maybe it's just me & I'm fortunate but so many people seem unable to get through the little problems that life throws up on their own & without help of any kind anymore, like inventing a friend for one thing.I know plenty of people who like this, intelligent some of them, so I've no problem with people who enjoy 'Arty & deep' films with psychological meaning to them. I just don't. But not through failing to understand them, Just merely through not connecting with characters who suffer problems like a 'mid-life crisis for non deserving reasons'.On top of all of that, it was a very slow film too.",0
"I went to see this with a friend because I'd heard 'it was good' at the local IMAX theater, no less. I went in with absolutely no knowledge on it whatsoever. Once I actually saw it, I realized it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some real stinkers. I'd rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back Ed Wood marathon.I can't think of a single thing I enjoyed about Fight Club. What there is of a plot is all over the place, the lines are beyond cringe-worthy, it's way too preachy, and the 'plot twist' at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat**** crazy.The secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings? Who knew? Much like the fights, there's no subtlety in the plots. Yeah, yeah, materialism is bad, we're not what we own, blah blah blah. Did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours? If you feel like you're in a rat race and you hate your job, THEN QUIT AND FIND SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S MORE WORTHWHILE TO YOU.I could hardly believe that was Brad Pitt. His performances in 12 Monkeys and Se7en were far superior to this trashy flick.Is Fincher incapable of making a movie that doesn't look like the lenses have been sprayed with Campbell's beef broth? The cinematography is choppy, and there's only so much I can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason.They should have used some of that soap to clean up the film.From me, 1 star.",0
"If you find anything at all edifying in this film then you must be incredibly gullible--even for a filmgoer.  Never got past the idea that we were being sold this supposed critique of our consumerist, soulless society by none other than News Corporation (Rupert Murdoch).  These people are just toying with you--they're in it for the money and have no conviction whatsoever (as is born out by the ending--the film goes...NOWHERE).  Avoid this nonsense.",0
"The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.Everything this movie had to say has been said before, and better. And sometimes just as badly. (See ""Zabriskie Point"" for another example of an overblown, smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs. evil products like Wonder Bread.) ""Fight Club"" was just a cynical exercise from a self-important director seeing how much he could get away with.",0
"As an earlier comment stated, the first 2/3rds of this movie are truly intriguing. The visuals are slick, but not in you Blade-meets-Mortal-Kombat kinda way, instead focusing on delivering irony, sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition ( and even some hi tech effects, like when the credits roll).   Edward Norton plays the narrator, and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put, awesome, because the movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously ( althought it is serious ). One plus point is the fact that the narrator doesn't step on a soapbox to preach and condemn, he just...narrates and observes.   However, after the first half of the movie is over, it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun. For starters, the attention to detail lowers, the dialogues start to dumb down, you get this ""anything can happen now, no matter how far fetched"" feeling, and plain and simple, it just gets silly. As in ""6th sense"", another recent movie, there a ""shocking"" twist near the end. But instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former, here it all seems contrived, forced, it just doesn't fit. All in all, Fight Club is not a bad movie, but I really wished it had ended as good as it started...",0
"(Preface: I really think I was careful enough with my words to avoid any spoiling, but if vague descriptions count as spoilers to you, don't read on.)Let's face it - it's all about fighting - gruesome, stupid, uncivilized, uncultured, immature fighting. If you are a caveman, go ahead and like this movie. If not, then I am sincerely grateful for your existence in our world.On a side note, despite the plot holes, I figured out who Pitt's character was since the end-of-the-apartment scene. I'd be interested to know if anyone else was able to predict the same thing.The very end of the movie falls under the same category as the body - immature, shallow, and useless. I just gotta say it - this is my least favorite movie of all time.",0
"Boring, quasi-philosophical violence-feast. The plot is dumb, the ""surprise"" twist is not surprising, the dialogue is stiff and lifeless (with lines like ""What you´re feeling is premature enlightenment""). Furthermore, Helena Bonham Carter isreally, truly miscast. How can anyone like this movie? (I know a lot of people do, but I just cannot understand why).",0
"Well it was a nice story, and so realistic. I'm sure most normal humans are pretty keen to take on an existence such as the one portrayed in ""Fight Club"". Surely the percentage of people in this world don't enjoy fighting. Fight Club made this out to be one of America's favourite pastimes. I've spent significant time in the USA and never saw one fight.It was a dull and boring movie, and I suggest Eddie Norton takes a good hard look at himself before being involved with a script like that again. Helena too. As for Bradles, after accepting a part in ""Legends of the Fall"", nothing surprises me with his movie selections, even though the boy has talent. I feel this was more like some kind of hardcore modern fairytale as opposed to a realistic society pastime.",0
"This is one of the most Unpleasant Films you are likely to see. Making you Squirm is perhaps one of its 'Charms"" and part of what makes it a Teen Favorite.This is an Ugly Thing, both in Tone and the way it Looks. It starts out with a lot of Unsightly Stuff. Like the Victim Self-Help Meetings where we have to look at a Homely Woman, about to Die, looking to ""just get laid one more time before it ends"" and Meat Loaf with Huge Man-Breasts drooping to his waste being hugged by Ed Norton while exchanging Affection and Sweat.That's just the beginning. It gets a lot more Repulsive as things go along their Merry Way. We have the Central Conceit and Title of the Movie, that Place where Lonely Guys meet to Beat and Bond. Then things really get out of hand with a Zombie Squad and a lot of Speechifying about the Evils of Capitalism, Consumerism, and Zen Stuff like ""when you own your possessions they own you"" and other Well Worn Witicisims that might have been Insightful a Thousand Years Ago.If you are a Fan of those Bare Knuckle Cage Matches, Guy Ritchie Movies, Neo-Nazis, or Anarchists Anonymous, this may be Entertaining. But it can also be a Pseudo-Intellectual, Inane, Disturbing Diatribe that is not Cathartic, just a Vile, Witless Waste, Pretending to be an Ultra-Cool, Post-Modern Philosophical Guidepost for the New Millennium. The Film is Objectionable, Hideous, Unsightly, Overrated, Trashy, Dumbed-Down, Unforgivable, and Absolutely Awful. The Stylish, Talented Director can not be Forgiven for this Wildly out of Control Poisonous Picture.",0
"I saw this film at a free preview about a week before it was released and two years later I can still remember how angry I was wasting an evening on this drivel.The whole premise that these guys can't feel any emotion unless they're beating the hell out of each other is ridiculous and boring.I can't remember one thing I liked about this movie.Not the script,none of the performances,the editing or cinematography,nothing.Maybe this film taps into the current anarchist views and aspirations  of whatever generation we're up to,but who cares?If there was a  score lower than one,I wouldn't hesitate to mark it on my ballot.",0
"So there is a twist in this film
It's a similar twist which has been done in other films better.
The film was ok.
It did not particularly hold my attention.
Quite why it has such a high score is bizarre.
Maybe it's the combination of brad Pitt plus plot twist.
But really if you look at other films with similar scores in my view this film does not deserve to have a score above 8 at best.",0
"Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.",0
"It would be interesting to know the ages of the people who gave this movie more than 5 stars. I just cannot imagine they are older than 20, most of them must be between 13 and 17.The title of this movie made me avoid it like the pest for a long time, sensing it was going to be bad. Yesterday, I finally watched it, and boy, it was even worse than I thought it would be! It was so bad that from time to time I had to fast forward it.This movie's biggest problem: unbelievably contrived. Its sole purpose is desperately try to be different, shocking, revolutionary, subversive. It tries so hard that it fails miserably. And for one simple reason: childishness.Watching grownup men being constantly childish is simply not funny, much less interesting. Unless you are a redneck or not older than 17.",0
"This movie doesn't know exactly what it wants. The movie is very slow on pace. I actually like the kind of movies that first try to build the characters and make you delve into the atmosphere. This movie wasn't building any character or atmosphere but what it was building is total BOREDOM.I didn't want to watch this movie till the end but then I thought about the high points that people have given it and some of the reviewers were talking about its great twist ending. But the ending alone couldn't save the 90% of this movie's boredom.I really feel cheated, I want my money and above all 139 min of my life back that I wasted on this crap.My advice to you people who haven't seen this movie please don't waste your valuable resources on this crap.",0
"Just came from a sneak preview of this movie, Edward Norton was nice enough to bring the movie to his alma mater, Yale University, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to the preliminary hype, or to the quality of his other work. The problem here isn't acting- he is still good in a demanding role that merited top billing(rather than being put under Pitt), and the rest of the cast does admirably as well, although Brad Pitt has played a role much like this before(see 12 Monkeys) and Helena Bonham Carter's role is pretty much as demeaning to women as it gets. Jared Leto and Meat Loaf, yes, Meat Loaf, are also in this movie, although you may not recognize Leto with a badly scared face or Meat Loaf with breasts(no, I didn't stutter). This film owes a lot to The Game, David Fincher's last movie, in that it ends up with a complex plot that is solved a little too easily and non-logically- I won't destroy the film by explaining how exactly, but the movie basically builds up to a climax that just doesn't resolve much, and then resolves that with a further illogical ending. The laughs along the way are not for the faint of heart or those who don't appreciate black comedy, but they are the highlights of the film, from the odd humor of Norton and Carter being addicted to help sessions for diseases they don't have, to Pitt's interesting use of liposuction byproducts. There's never too much appeal to the violence of the movie, but the combination of nihilism and comedy doesn't send the movie into mediocrity. It's when the movie turns serious that it starts to turn sour, as the plot twists out of control and a strange comedy turns into just another movie in the Seven/The Game/The Matrix genre of stylish, mindless violence without much purpose, point, or original plot. The script shows elements of literature that may have just been better in the original book, but otherwise, this is a movie with not much going for it except its cast. Answering questions, Edward Norton joked about how working with Brad Pitt was easier for him because he could always rag on him about Pitt's bad movies- ""Whenever he'd get on me, I'd just have to say 'Cool World'""- and also said he thought he had yet to be part of a ""stinker"". This may just be his first, and Pitt's latest.",0
"This is a good example of what happens when people who've been reading comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher's adolescent pursuits but the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very little articulate and nothing even remotely original about ""Fight Club"". Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early '90s MTV, Kubrick, punk, etc, etc?.When all the unnatural 'coolness' (jump cuts, hipper than thou narrative, flickering images?) is stripped away, what you're left with is a bunch of half-ass, unfinished ideas about capitalist social order, human nature, battle of the sexes, meaning of life in a modern world, male frustration etc. And in a movie that chooses to treat its characters solely as metaphors rather than to tell a story, it's especially important that at least a shred of uniqueness in point of view is present. As it is, ""Fight Club"" doesn't even seem to have a coherent point of view about the subjects it touches on, other than maybe ""go let it out"" or ""if it feels good do it"". Yeah man, rock'n'roll!!!It begins with nameless character (played by Edward Norton), known in credits only as Narrator, spiritually and physically beaten 30-year-old professional fighting insomnia and seeking a way to reconnect with the world, although I doubt he was ever properly connected to begin with. He is engaged in a losing battle with life he chose (although judging by his misery you'd think somebody else chose it for him). Battle that's fought on modern day yuppie frontlines - corporate offices, airports, his expensive IKEA decorated condo, airline first class, business trips etc., and is in desperate need of something. Watching from aside one would think that something is emotional comfort, meaning, love or a thing along those lines. Whatever it is, he seems to have found it, albeit briefly, in various disease support groups that he now starts to frequent pretending to have different ailment or disease for every day of the week. Listening to people, in some cases dying, open up about their problems gives him a visceral sense of freedom. Suddenly he can sleep and enjoy life again. ""I let go. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom"", he reasons. Until?..Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) strolls into his life and messes all of that up. She, you see, is also a 'tourist' - someone pretending to be sick - and the knowledge that another person like him is present at these meetings bothers our Narrator to the point that his insomnia returns. He confronts her about that and to avoid running into each other they divvy up the meetings in a lame exchange that tries to be funny but only ends up resembling something Rachel and Chandler might say to each other on 'Friends'.The story then shifts to Narrator's relationship with a strange but fascinating fellow named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) with whom he hits it off on a plane during a business trip. Their bond intensifies after Narrator returns home and finds his condo blown to smithereens as a result of an electrical malfunction. Having no family or friends to turn to in a time of need, he calls Tyler and soon moves in with him in a boarded-up apocalyptic house. On Tyler's insistence they found a weekly fight club that starts up as a jealously guarded secret clique where a few young males can nurse their anxieties and frustrations by beating each other to a bloody pulp!? Bingo! This is what Narrator has been looking for all his adult life.Soon, though, the whole thing grows in popularity, Marla makes a return, Tyler's behaviour takes stranger turns and problems start to pile up. It is during this part that the movie makes its various cheesy points. Case-in-point the scene in which Tyler ambushes a convenience store, takes the clerk outside, points a gun to his head and under a threat of death forces him to go back to college. Wow, symbolism overload!!! And how deep, too!The rest of the movie seldom gets better than that including a sketchy ending that features a crucial fist/gun fight, a bomb with obligatory display counting down and other such things no true Hollywood action movie can do without.In the end I kinda felt like I watched an extended commercial/music video that made me think of Spike Jonze. Then I learned David Fincher also directed music videos. And although this was more viewable than Jonze's dismal ""Being John Malkovich"" it's still a pretty mediocre offering. Those who refer to ""Fight Club"" as a masterpiece probably also consider Eminem and Fred Durst to be the modern generation's sharpest voices.",0
"I have read other reviews of this movie, and I think that my outlying, grossly negative opinion, may have something to do with the fact that I do not identify at all with this movie.  I am proud to say this.  It is sad that so many people did see something of themselves in this movie.  I feel truly sorry for you.It was obviously never this movie's intent to be entertaining, or to make you care about the characters, humanity, or society.",0
"Despite the clever crafting of this film, it is basically a complain-fest about the poor upper-class privileged white male blaming all his woes on Ikea. Is this the extent of self-proclaimed victimization that is taking over American culture? Disturbingly to any intellectuals, this movie's amorality passes itself off under the guise of reason -- as if the central character has a logic to his rage and subsequent violent decisions -- as if the poor young white businessman who's been educated well and raised in an upper middle class lifestyle with all the benefits really is some sort of victim of retail stores. Is it really proving a coherent point to blow something up? It's even more upsetting to think about this after seeing 9-11 take this film's logic into reality...is the point of this movie to say that American commercial freedom SHOULD be attacked? With all the sexification and glamorizing of violence, and its poor-me ranting against consumer products (rather than taking responsibility for one's own commercialism or participation in it), it's hard to find a redeemable net-sum to this movie. Ed Norton is, as always, terrific. Brad Pitt very good in this role too. And I very much appreciate the filmmaker's talent, but I wish he would use it for something that was thoughtful.",0
"I won't try to write an outline of the film, others have done a good job of that here already, I'll just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it: This is one poor movie. Due to the buildup I expected something pretty good. My enthusiasm went progressively downhill as I watched the story develop and when Ed Norton performs the revealing scene (Which I suppose I should not describe here) I felt like pulling the tape out right there, I was that insulted. I am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in IMDB. What possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list? I have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male (the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from). I would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in IMDB. I get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the IMDB with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale. Oh well, if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly, knock yourself out.",0
"( May Spoil (WARNING) ) I seen this in the theater's when it came out in 99'. I payed $7.00 dollars to see it. The second i found out ""The Secret"". I wanted to beat someone up all right. No plot. Plot don't make since.. If i was in a basement full of guys. and had to watch someone abuse them self. And they thought it was interesting. I would exit as fast as i can.. I have to wright ten lines in order for me to be able to warn you that I don't even think this qualifies as a movie.. There is no plot. or story.. that I can see making a movie about. Therese a point where his ""non-self"" shots a gun at him and blows out a van window? so.. is the gun real? is the bullet real? did the window blow out or was that imagined?",0
"Yes, this movie is quite different. However, aside from the possibility that no one's done it before because they weren't smart/inspired/good enough to, there's also the other one.  This is a movie that fails so remarkably, you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure.In the one excellent scene in this movie, Edward Norton, flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour, Brad Pitt (aka Tyler Durden, here). ""very clever."" Pitt replies ""how is that going for you?""That is both funny and poignant. The rest of the movie, however, is neither. In fact, it's just the same as poor Ed Norton - too clever for its own good.Worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause. Many of the others commented (and other people who've seen this movie) think that Tyler Durden is somehow the voice of good, a positive role model, if you will. And some people are completely nuts about this movie, they quote it day and night and I don't know, it's just weird.And then there's the ending. I can't give it away, but the best thing that I can say about it is that it is gimmicky. It's also pretty implausible, doesn't fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers (something we now know is not a very good idea).If you're going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending, fine. It's possible to make a good one - The Usual Suspects for example. But having a clever movie that isn't clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed? A clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is? A clever message movie? Where the message is delivered by someone who's obviously, shall we say, not very emotionally/mentally stable, to say the least?I guess you could say it's irony, but then with the same success you can say that ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a movie that makes one think 'cause it makes you think what the heck you're doing watching/paying for such an awful movie.Having said all that, this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, Helena Bonham Carter isn't.Okay, maybe it's not the most overrated movie on IMDb - after all ""The Shwshank Redemption"" is ranked #2 and ""Kingpin"" is not even on the bottom 100 at all. But it's pretty close.1/10. And that high only cause it took so much effort.",0
"coming from cast members who've enjoyed multi-million dollar l.a weddings etc.if you're going to comment on issues as fundamental as this, then live the lifestyle. otherwise it just doesn't wash. you should leave it to someone else.pitt is also very unrealistic as a tough guy in this movie. his performance in snatch was much better and benefited from some humour. the chain smoking carter is also tedious and fakei found this movie both pretentious and irritating. i've met many people who found this film illuminating... it said absolutely nothing to me.",0
"*Spoiler I guess*  Violent film about manly therapy through secret fight club has good start, intriguing premise and sharp actors but founders about Round 6 and ultimately is out on a TKO.  The wrap up is about as plain stupid as it gets and essentially invalidates everything before it.  I don't mean to be harsh, but who the heck is voting on these movies on Imdb?  If this is really in the top 40 movies of all time then I'm Harry Houdini.",0
"I was not going to watch this movie because the pre-views did not appeal to me and I am probably the only woman living who does NOT think that Brad Pitt is sexy. However, I have heard several people tell me what a good movie this is and more than half were women. So, it came on cable and I decided to watch it. At 2 hours, I turned it off and I was sorry that I waited that long. I kept hoping that it would get better. I understand the ""materialism is bad"" theme. I also understand the concept of Ed Norton's character having everything but feeling so lonely and depressed that he starts fight club with Brad Pitt in order to get attention and feel wanted. What I don't get is after starting the fight club, why start making bombs and blowing up buildings? So, the point that I get from this movie is that it is OK to start and/or join terrorists organizations because someone is unhappy, pathetic and generally miserable with their life. I guess that all the folks that found this movie appealing and humorous, did not have friends or love ones in the World Trade Towers or the Pentagon. Because, wasn't it a bunch of unhappy, miserable, materialist-hating people that bombed both of those places?The only thing that makes me depressed are movies like this.",0
"After having my little brother and friends hype the heck out of this film and claim it to be the greatest thing since sliced bread this came as a disappointment. There were too many boring stretches for me and not much in the way of story. It was like a (no pun intended) one-punch joke that fell flat about 30 minutes into the film. Brad Pitt was good, if out of place. Ed Norton delivers his dialogue as if he were asleep and comes across as a second-rate John Cusack wanna-be. Helen Carter is funny in parts and Meatloaf is just hilarious. Thumbs in the middle for this one. This movie fell flat at the box-office as struggling 20th Century Fox (and this is NOT a bad thing) tries to come up with fresh ideas to lure the teenage audience, without having to recycle 30-year old science-fiction films.",0

"I don't know about anyone one else but when I watch a film I have one goal, to be entertained.  I can say without any reservation I was not entertained for even one minute during Fight Club.  What really shocks me is that this film is rated so highly.  Apparently so many who have watch this film find the bizarre so appealing.  To me a film is good when it's entertaining. You know, enjoyable to watch.  I found nothing even remotely enjoyable about this film.  Fight Club is nothing more than a film about dysfunction and LOTS of it.  Bizarre hallucinations and violence.  Is this thought provoking or intelligent?  Sorry, I don't see that.  My recommendation, if you're a person who looks for true entertainment in a film look elsewhere.  I am definitely worse off for spending 2.5 hours on Fight Club.  I give it 1 out of 10.",0
"I remember reading somewhere that Mr B.Pitt said that the significance of this film would be appreciated by people of next century.What does that mean? And who makes him the expert on people's thought in the next century? All I hope is that he should be born in the next century,so that I don't have to see his face and hear his name all the time while I am alive.I am feeling increasingly that we as movie-goer are becoming snobbish all the time. It seems, nowadays movies are intended not for you to watch,but for you to interpret.Then, instead of taking coke and popcorn into cinemas, we should have a notebook and pencil at hand.What this movie is all about,I don't know.And I am wondering how many of you people out there DO know what it is and why it is so ""great"".Are there really so many extreme situations and times in our lives? If it is,then staying normal should be viewed as something abnormal.After all,what is wrong with the ordinary men's life and feelings?Shouldn't movies display these instead of showing people the extreme cases all the time?As to Mr Norton, I have but just one feeling:truly admiration.Of all the movies I have seen him playing, he is always suffering from a split personality.He must either be a complete nuts or the toughest guy alive,psychologically.And what is funny about people's high appreciation of him is that there must be so many of you who are living experts on abnormity of personality, otherwise how can you truly appreciate a thing weird as that.Honestly, I HATE movies like this.It's so called ""taste""only makes people snobbish.To me,it is far more noble to go to a movie,because you want to see a certain actor or actress,then because you are told this is one ""DEEP"" movie by those sick film critics.",0
"POSSIBLE SPOILERSLooking at the subject lines of many of the reviews, I see phrases like ""pure genius,"" ""brilliant,"" and ""a work of art.""  This movie is not brilliant, it is not a work of art, it is a train wreck, pure and simple! There were so many interesting ideas introduced in the beginning of this film, but somehow they fizzled along the way.  The idea of a group of men trying to fill the void left by consumer society was interesting.  Then, Project Mayhem, a cult-type operation where none of the members can think for themselves, which seems to contradict the theme set forward by the first hour of the movie.  The movie changes from an intelligent satire to your standard action/suspense flick, with a little psychological suspense and quirky romance thrown in for good measure, Tyler Durden spouting philosophy the whole way through.  This movie did have some very good cinemetography and editing, and it was very quirky and high in shock value, which seems to be enough to get most people to overlook its inherent flaws.  I can only hope that a few years down the road, people will be able to see this movie for what it truly is, a movie that could have been great, but somehow blew it.",0
"I ordinarily don't take the time to comment on things of this nature, but this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! Fight Club had absolutely no plot and no message to give to the audience. It was replete with violence, sex, gore, all with no purpose whatsoever. The movie said nothing - it was just film and actors. If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be gratuity! There was gratuitous sex, violence, and blood and guts. Apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie, and I don't know what that says for our society and how easily we can be entertained. This movie is a waste of anyone's time. I highly recommend that you stay as far away from Fight Club as possible!",0
"Major spoilers. This movie will only get a two on my scale of one-to-ten because of the twist in the ending, and even the twist isn't all that great. People say this movie is great. Insightful. Exhilarating. I say it's complete trash and almost a waste of time. The characters aren't bad, except for that really ugly lady (change your hair and clean yourself up). She plays some psycho nymphomaniac who falls for Tyler Durden's (Brad Pitt) body. Eventually those two get together and have constant sex, which gets really old because the house is shaking all the time and the narrator explains how annoying it is. Soon the story gets boring and we find that the Fight Club is really a group of losers who are deviant maniacs bent on disrupting society. Let's face it, the only reason anyone should ever watch this movie all the way through is to find out that Tyler Durden is actually the narrator, and the narrator is Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden doesn't even exist. That twist really fell below the status of ""bad"". This movie really falls below the status of ""annoying, stupid, boring, disgusting, monotonous, and ridiculous"". The music reeks, the acting isn't great, the storyline is awful, the plot is stupid, and nothing fits together real well to make this movie solid. I implore everyone to avoid this movie.",0
"Last night was the very first time I have ever watched this movie. One of my Facebook friends bought me a copy because I had never seen it. I knew this movie had a cult following and after finally watching, I'm trying to understand why. Maybe if I watched it several more times, it'll grow on me, but I have a feeling I won't for quite a while. It wasn't all bad. It did have some decent and funny moments. I liked Helena Bonham Carter's character. The middle half of the movie was probably the best, but it went down-hill for me when the 'fight club' basically turned into a cult and the weird twist involving Brad Pitt's character. Edward Norton stars as a traveling automobile company employee who suffers from insomnia. He's known as The Narrator because he visits support groups to see how other people suffer. He eventually meets a woman a lot more miserable than him named Marla Singer. After his apartment explodes, he calls up Tyler Durden, a man who he befriended on a plane. They slowly start a 'Fight Club' where guys meet up and just beat each other up. If you like movies that are supposed to be considered 'great' you might enjoy FIGHT CLUB!!!",0
"Typically over-directed David Fincher nonsense.Is he actually able to direct a movie that isn't dank, grimy and depressing? There are way to many people out there who hold this claptrap in too high regard. Perhaps they confuse the muddled and self-congratulatory rubbish that is the plot for something deep and meaningful.I found that this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be cynical and faithless. It became increasingly obnoxious and irritating. Edward Norton's character had the most annoying voice and the constant ugly imagery turned me off totally. If this film wanted to poke fun at our society then why did it only show all the ugly parts. Granted, there is a lot of fake, unnatural beauty out there but a helluva lot of this world is still free and nice to look at. Not everywhere is a dull, grey office or a miserable, rainy alleyway.It is also very, very slow. 139 minutes have never seemed so long.A lot of this film could have been cut out and still there would be no MAJOR difference to the story I like the idea that everyone is part of the same gang and by sticking together they can easily bring down modern society. This should have been exploited more. But we only get about 4 or 5 scenes of their antics. But, the whole thing of the gang becoming fascists in their attempt to stop fascism is lost on me. I didn't find it ironic, subtle or meaningful. Sorry.The sub-text about man becoming primal again, and releasing all the rage created from jobs that insult their intelligence and ruin their lives, is lost on me too. It's practically non-existent. I have never been let down so much by a movie that was hyped as being exciting. It was really rather boring.The DVD has a loads of features, annoying and headache inducing. Why did Fox insist on a dozen little featurettes instead of one healthy hour-long documentary? The menus are confusing as is the multi-angle function on the 5-minute ""scene deconstructions"". Who on earth is going to watch all of these 2 or 3 times just to see the different angles and bad camcorder shots of someone working on a computer? The movie itself is in Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 2.40:1.",0
"Fight Club is the most over-rated movie I have ever seen (barely beating out Gladiator).  It is also one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Its only redeeming quality is if you take it as an examination of mob mentality in a group of reprobates - except in that light, its quality ends up seeming like someone's final project for their high school psychology class (as in, amateurish and not very detailed).People talk about its ""depth"".  My answer to that is, ""What Depth?"".I have no problem with its premise - people are dissatisfied.  Hey, I could handle ""The computers that rule the future can build a nearly-indestructible attack robot out of liquid metal"" in Terminator 2, dissatisfied people is nothing.  Even the incorrect placement of blame is believable.What bothers me, though, is that the movie attempts to pass itself off as an accurate portrayal of the real world.  I'm not saying there aren't people like that.  What I'm saying is that they aren't right.  They aren't automatons, they're unambitious.  They aren't ""suppressed by an overly-materialistic society"".  They're just whining and looking for someone else to blame for their problems.  I have an easier time believing Marx's nonsense about class identity than I do the things this film tries to pass off as ""meaningful social commentary"".Fight Club doesn't have a social message.  Fight Club isn't entertaining.Don't watch Fight Club.",0
"The fact that so many people liked this movie disturbed me. Is violence really the only way to escape societal constraints? Using consumerism as a straw man, the movie says that all males are, inherently, prone to violence and that society is denying them the right to exercise this innateness. After glorifying violence for 2 1/2 hours, the filmmakers decide to say ""but really violence is not quite as good as we might have led you to believe."" Most males will come out of this movie saying "" cool man. we should start a fight club so that we can be real men"" and that is irresponsible filmmaking.",0
"Who needs this movie? I sure don't. Looks like generation X or Y or whatever the hell they are called this week love it. I'll say this, it is the perfect movie for young troubled, bored, ignored, misunderstood, ever-changing teens who need to escape from the shadows of their predecessors and give themselves that angry identity of screw the world I'm different.Looks like some reviewers lives are so blah that they need to push the levels of taste until they are totally disgusting and morally wrong. What kind of parents do they have is my question.First of all, punching someone in the face that many times can kill them or at least send them to the dentist for free. What makes the kids of today enjoy this type of behavior, fantasy or not? A lot of shirtless men, sure that's a great reason to applaud this movie for some of the messed up women out there who keep picking violent men as boyfriends and then wonder why. I saw no redeeming value in this movie. It took me for a ride and then fooled me at the end, but if anyone rates this in their top 5, 10, whatever then I can guess their age category. Go to school, get a job, have a nice life and adjust your attitudes. I sure don't have the perfect life but obviously better than some of the messed up kids who like this because I don't need to watch people beat the s*** out of each other for entertainment. I'm shocked by the number of positive reviews for this crap. Get therapy, please.I give this movie a 3 of 10, and that's generous. It sure is not rated an 8 like the score in front reveals. Now I know overall statistics mean absolutely nothing.",0
"A man tired of his yuppie condo and dead-end job moves into a dilapidated house with a stranger and starts an underground club where young men beat each other up to bloody pulp just for the fun of it. When that becomes old, they engage in terrorist activities. There is a lame plot twist, which should not surprise most viewers, that blows the story full of holes and turns the movie from merely bad to abominably bad, culminating in a laughably ludicrous finale. The message of this paean to sado-masochism is that a man has to suffer and inflict pain on others in order to...sell tickets. What is most disturbing is that many consider this vile piece of garbage to be a masterpiece, a sad reflection of our society.",0
"Gratuitous violence and a cheesy made-for-teenagers twist at the end.  I suspect that males under the age of 20 will love it, though.  The drivel disguised as philosophy will fool the naive and someone, somewhere will be dumb enough to emulate the fighting.  One or two visits to the hospital, though, will be enough to change most folks' minds.",0
"I hated every single second of this miserable ""movie"". Its boring, unfunny and totally depressing. Everytime Norton does his voiceover, I wanted to cry, he has the dullest voice in the history of film. Norton is so over rated, I dont know why he is seen as a good actor. I am a fan of Pitt, but he is totally wasted, and i came to realise this is sadly Nortons film not Pitts. If you want to to be bored and depressed for a few hours feel free to watch this trash.",0
"Nothing is worse than a film that pretends to be intellectual and profound yet is really just a boring rant against society. This film is just that. The plot is non-existent, the story is full of holes and the only worthwhile acting is done by Edward Norton. I still can't figure out why the main female character was even in the film.This is just a transparent schizophrenic bad movie and is amazingly shallow.",0
"Fight Club is regarded as a fantastic movie and it is currently rated in the IMDb top ten. I guess this was supposed to be a movie for a specific generation, or for the people who were actively watching films in 1999. I still to this day do not understand what all the fuss is about? Yes this film is different from the traditional action and drama films but just because its different, it doesn't mean its good let alone fantastic or a work of art. Now this movie is supposed to be a representation, imagination or fragmentation Edward Norton's character the unnamed narrator and the movie in almost its entirety is his imagination including all the characters you see appear in the film including Brad Pitt. So basically this movie follows the ""It was all a dream"" concept where whatever you see is not real. I do not mind the idea if it is presented properly but this movie takes this concept to extremely ridiculous levels, where I have a hard time deciding if this film is supposed to be a drama film, an action film or fantasy.Fight Club has too many weird moments, unnecessary violence, Edward going bonkers and crippling and destroying another man during a fight for almost no reason at all. The film also has some disgusting scenes like the Fat guy with bigger chest than girls with implants that's disgusting, and made me want to turn off the film, not because there was a fat guy but I was disgusted how terrible this film portrays such people as if they are aliens. The plot is hardly a saving grace, it starts out promising, with people who are depressed are seeking help that could have been a good and interesting premise to base the film upon, but the more the plot progresses, the worse and the more ridiculous it gets. After the first 30 minutes this film was a torture to sit through. The ending was also nonsensical to me because I think the entire premise of this film is flawed from the start. The Narrator can't kill Tyler directly so he shoots himself so Tyler dies because Tyler was what Edward wanted to be. Whatever don't spend too much time thinking over that. The only saving grace is the acting of the lead actors Norton and Pitt. Edward Norton is really into the character at least he did the best he could with the script he was given to work with, despite all the ridiculous moments, Norton's good performance breathes some life into the movie. Brad Pitt also does a commendable job as Tyler although I did not like Tyler, I felt like Brad was at least trying. Never understood the love for this film, I have nothing against the people who like it I just don't understand where all the love comes from, in my personal opinion, Fight club is not a good film and is overrated.",0
"Just the fact that most men that drool over this film tend to react angrily when I convey my negative opinions of ""Fight Club"", proves that this film not only fails to deliver any new and important ideas, but also that it encourages the mainstream male marketing plan: Be angry, be violent, be masculine, be straight, be selfish, and most of all be stupid. The film employs a juvenile sense of humor/ comedy approach that's immature and sickening. The ending is a total idiotic rip off that makes the watching of this garbage a waste of time. The deep message here is that young white males victimized by society can fight commercialism by beating the s**t out of each other. Wow man, that's really deep. Cue ""You just don't get the movie man"". Yeah, I just don't get the movie. What a joke.The whole premise behind ""Fight Club"" is tiresome and trite, oh the poor straight healthy young male! And how he's been victimized? ""Fight Club"" is a movie produced by the sickening Hollywood greed machine; and the funny thing is that the makers of this film are essentially preaching about commercialization and greed. That really makes sense. I wonder how many fat cat pots were filled by this production? Here's a tip to all young men that really want to fight greed, commercialism,and corporations........ GO TO COLLEGE, and major in something you have an interest in. I was shocked when I learned that men all over the U.S. started their own REAL fight clubs because of this movie. Brad Pitt beating me over the head with clichéd anti-commercialism ideals for over two hours is not my idea of an 8.7 rating. Pitt and Norton are lukewarm at best and overrated by most. The there's always the argument that, It's about a schizophrenic man"". Like that statement somehow justifies the idiocy of ""Fight Club"". But hey, I just don't get. F your macho bulls***.",0
"This is easily one of the worst films ever created.  The beginning, I must admit, is different and quite intriguing.  I mean, who would have ever thought of a guy who is addicted to 12 step programs.  But the minute that Brad Pitt's face hits the screen we are soon forced into mind numbing, senseless, violent trash.  I think that violence must be used for a purpose, such in Reserviour Dogs or Raging Bull.  In these movies we see violence as a tool to push the desperation and hopelessness of the main characters.  In Fight Club we see violence as a tool to drive along a bunch of nonsense, possibly the only reason I could see for all of the fights was for the male characters to bring out their pent up Freudian fantasies for violence.  If you want an immature movie where men beat the c**p out of each other for no reason then go ahead, bon appetite.  But if you want a movie that has any intelligence or sense of reality then please do your self a favor and spend your money elsewhere.",0
"Ed Norton character: ""I don't know. I'm just not content with my life. I have a job that doesn't do anything to benefit mankind. I have so many possessions, but they don't make me happy. I just feel there must be more to life than this shallow, commercial, material world I live in. I want to do something different.""Me: ""Well, it's very commendable of you to re-evaluate your priorities. So, since you don't like your material possessions, are you going to get rid of all your IKEA furniture and move to a smaller apartment, one that you actually feel comfortable in?""Norton: No.Me: Well, since your job isn't fulfilling, are you going to quit and join the PEace Corps, or get a job as a teacher in an poor neighborhood?Norton: Nah.Me: Well, since you're looking for some higher meaning to life, are you going to start going to church?Norton: Nope.Me: Sigh... okay, so what ARE you going to do?Norton: I think I'll get together with a bunch of other unfulfilled guys, and then we'll beat the snot out of each other.
**If that strikes you as profound, well, then ""Fight Club"" is the movie for you. If it sounds ridiculous (and it should!), avoid it like the plague.The ironic and amusing thing is, most of the fanboys who rave about this movie are geeks who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, and would run crying to their mommies if someone even LOOKED like he was going to throw a punch at them!",0
"This is the worst piece of trash I've seen in many a long year.I've seen comments that the movie presents the shallowness and hypocrisy of the squares all around us, and offers a way out through the infliction and receipt of pain in bare-knuckled brawling with consenting partners.Sorry, I can't see it that way.  All I see is a tiresome and unappetizing jerk who turns into a tiresome masochist with bruises.  There is nothing liberating in this piece of trash.  There is only an inauthentic jerk who turns into a more disagreeable inauthentic jerk.Given that it takes a lot of money and a lot of talented people to make a movie like this, it's incomprehensible how this piece of trash like this ever got made, and even more incomprehensible how any sane and intelligent critic could find any redeeming qualities in it.If the movie demonstrates anything, it's that lunacy and tastelessness has taken over.  The inmates are in charge, and we're all living in a lunatic asylum.",0
"This is the first film I have seen in which the plot twist utterly and completely destroys the film. A good contrast is with ""Sixth Sense;"" the twist makes you look back at the film with even more interest. You may even want to see it again.  The plot twist here is so ridiculous, so embarassingly idiotic, that you suddenly feel ashamed to have enjoyed the film up to the point of its revelation. What were they thinking?",0
"Have you ever had flu or food poisening and have been laid up in bed with a fever? you know the feeling, you loose all track of time , you are not sure if you have slept and your dreams drift in to real life. Have you ever been so drunk that you wish you were dead, the feeling is the worst in the world isnt it.? Watching the Fight Club is all these feelings rolled into one. i can honestly say this is nearly the worst film i have ever seen. i wont try to go into what the film is about because i could not tell you. This film last 16 hours ..or so it feels. Looking at the box it says 133 minutes. i would rather have spent 133 minutes sticking pins under my finger nails. What complete rubbish. Please don't watch it. 1 out of 10.",0
"I cannot believe the number of rabid fans this sophomoric self-indulgent piece of watered down Nietzsche crossed with Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf has garnered. If this film was a life-changing experience for some of the reviewers I am wrung with pity at what that life must have been before, and with the thought of what it can have become. There was some amusing satire in here, but you had to wade through a lot of adolescent posing and prosing to hear it.I am commenting only because I think this tawdry junker needs a counterpoint to its unmerited adulation. If you found a lot in this movie and want to watch it again and again to validate your deep philosophical and artistic insights, you need to broaden your horizons. Grow up and join the real world. Ask for more from your art than this.",0
"It's amusing to see all the ""brilliant"" comments about this crap film. Fincher, a smoke and mirrors hack who is convinced that more is more, wants to sell you on the idea that we're living shallow lives. The proof's in the pudding here folks. He bashes you over the head with his ""themes"" like a college sophomore. He is a master of the odious, puerile 'wouldn't it be cool if this happened' school of story construction. The film is filled with desperate attempts at comedy, mostly of the gross-out, toilet variety - so no doubt the sub-20 dilettantes are enthralled - but the film is wall-to-wall form over substance. Most annoying are Fincher's pet signature moments - you'll see them in all his worthless work: mention a pilot light - and voil_, the camera flies around a stove and shows you a pilot light. Presumably he finds this is magical as he repeats it everywhere - but we know it's simply his unleashed attention whore personality being imposed where it doesn't belong. There's no need to 'spoil' the ending - it's obvious to any thinking person within the first 10 minutes what's going on. F-",0
"This movie is a well crafted, exciting, and ultimately thoughtless piece of propaganda, like ""Potemkin"", ""Triumph of the Will"" or ""Birth of a Nation"". It advances certain ideas (that we are all slaves to ""consumerism"" and have no choice but to buy products advertised to us, which we must revolt against by beating people up and exploding buildings), and argues them with images rather then words. In historical context, it will be seen alongside the WTO and IMF riots and the rise of the Green Party. Like most propaganda, a closer inspection will reveal how full of hypocrisy it is - notice all the product placements.",0
"I've heard many people say (and seen many reviews written) that Fight Club is a classic.  Mind blowing.  Completely fresh.  Sorry, but I just don't see it.  I'll start with the positives.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt were excellent. Pitt perfectly captures the super-cool, no attachments, nothing-to-lose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth.  Norton is also perfect as the uptight, frustrated yuppie bored with life's vapidity.  Even Helena Bonham Carter, who I normally don't much care for, was okay in the generic girlfriend role.Now on to the negatives.  The story is just utterly preposterous.  Maybe even more so than Fincher's last absurd movie, The Game.  The movie really lost all believability when Fight Club turns into the cult, Project Mayhem. Although it has a nice twist ending with the Pitt/Norton dynamic, I couldn't buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless, fanatical followers.  Pitt's charismatic, but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft.  The movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but I thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where Norton describes his perfect condo, filled with things he really didn't need.  Everything else is overkill.  And the final big plan to blow up (I won't say what in case you haven't seen the movie yet) in order to level the world playing field is...well....pointless. Just like The Game, Fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity.  I give it 6 out of 10.",0
"I cannot believe this film is rated so highly.  Granted, there is a Hollywood bias in this database, but rarely is such an idiotic film given such accolades!  After seeing the poster for this film I had no interest in seeing it.  But I watched it on the advice of a trusted friend, and was amazed at how much it was exactly as I had expected originally.  A macho guy film on a par with the ""Die Hards"" and ""Lethal Weapons"" of this world. ""Rambo"" too.",0
"I refuse to give away details of a film. Therefore this commentary is directed at people who have already seen the movie and may be a bit obscure to those who have not.Silly plot, gratuitous violence, way too long and very predictable. (If the mono frame shots of Pitt and the identical baggage clues weren't enough to explain exactly what was happening, then H.B. Carter's reaction scene when Norton asks her what she is doing there the morning after, should have made it crystal clear... for anyone over twelve.) I was shocked by how many previous comments referred to an unexpected ""twist"" at the end.Fight Club is simultaneously homo-erotic and homophobic, I think the overwhelming popularity of this film among 18-25 year old (confused) males unfortunately may be explained by the concept repeatedly expressed throughout the film that it is OK to bond with or even hug other men but only if you also hurt each other.I can only recommend purchasing or renting this DVD to those readers who are BOTH somewhat sadistic AND not very bright.",0
"Let me just get this out of the way right off the bat -- I hated this movie. I think the initial meeting of Jack and Tyler explain how opinions of this movie are divided -- Jack says something about single serving friends, and Tyler disinterestedly dismisses his cleverness.  Unfortunately, my friends, being clever for clever's sake is not entertaining and it is not art.
For those of you who loved this movie, perhaps identifying yourselves with the main character is not appropriate.  The point may be that you are just one of the moronic automatons (do hyper-clever acts of terrorism, like a hyper-clever movie), so the joke's on you.  You might also note that the project chaos morons are not recruited for their propensity for violence, but for their desire to think in complex and sensitive ways.  Much like the fans of this movie.I tend to rate a movie on only two criteria:  Was it entertaining? and, Did I care about the characters?  As both of these answers for Fight Club are definitely ""NO"", what am I left with?  A movie with an unoriginal message, revealed in an unintellible way, full of commercials (Starbucks, Busch beer, Pepsi, to name a few), with decent acting.Yes, the pseudo-intellegentsia are all suckers, easy prey to a little pretentiousness they identify with.  In making this obvious fact a little more obvious, the movie was a success.  Maybe the point was to think for yourselves, in which case the only natural reaction should be complete loathing for this film.",0
"This film starts off well and keeps you interested until about half way through.In the second half of the film, the storyline goes all over the place, and when you realise what's actually going on, then you realise how ridiculous it all is! As a result, the film loses all credibility and you're just left feeling cheated! Whereas with other promising bad films, the problem is usually that the basic idea for the plot is good and they are simply badly executed (like The Sixth Sense) - here the main idea is absurd and is also executed badly! The only good things in this film are the acting and the camera-work, which is admittedly good. But for a good film you need a good plot! Not a ridiculous one! All in all, very bad, not worth watching and certainly doesn't deserve to be anywhere in the list of best 250 films! Avoid at all cost, will leave you feeling disillusioned.",0
"First off, I'm not going to say this film was terrible and anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot. We all have our own idiosyncrasies that colour how we view art and I respect other's views enough to know that nothing is categorical terrible (or brilliant) for every member of the audience.But, for me...I think Fight Club had something to say, but to me it didn't seem very original or subtle.  Among other themes in other films, I've seen the two identities thing done much better in David Lynch's Lost Highway and feel American Psycho did the male alienation in corporate America thing in a subtler (and funnier) way. Fight Club seemed so straightforward and obvious that I felt like the director was 'dumbing it down' for me, almost insulting my intelligence...I don't know, maybe it's just my taste.I'm glad so many people did get so much out of it though, that is one of the most important criteria for a film to have to be considered great, so I guess this is a great film.",0
"The movie is about an ordinary guy, who leads an ordinary, drab life trying to rise above his position near the bottom of the corporate ladder.  You soon find that he is an insomniac.  Later, you find that he also has another personality.  His other personality is an anti-establishment, anti-consumer, anti-God, anti-everything, uninteresting psycho.  The movie centers around this psychotic idiot creating an army of even stupider low-lifes to do his bidding, which includes destruction of and creating chaos within our established social system.  The fight club is the army, and it began when men decided that they got a wonderful ""release"" by inflicting and receiving pain during fights.  What a wonderful idea for a movie!!  If you are a complete manic depressive psycho idiot neo nazi, that is!  This movie is over 2 hours long, and it is a shame because in my busy life I just lost over 2 hours of my weekend.  I kept waiting for the movie to show me its purpose.  This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen.  I guess the writer relates to the characters.  I am proud to say I do not.  And if many people do relate to the brainwashed psycopaths in this movie, then society is in big trouble.  This movie can only accomplish 2 things:  Waste your time, or convince really stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain.  I walked away from this movie angry that someone could spend $50 million making it.  Don't waste your time.",0
"This is a set-piece for two of the finest contemporary actors in Norton and Pitt. Their performances as the narrator and Tyler Durden are superb, as any other review herein will show you. The cinematography is good, directing fine and the script at times good.However, I was disappointed with the movie as a whole. The actors are clearly leading up to a climax which was predictable, had you seen more movies of this thriller/drama/action genre. If you want a brilliant ending, watch Primal Fear (Norton excellent), if you want a suave and well written script watch Chasing Amy and for an action movie with brutal fight scenes Raging Bull. For a complete movie that will move you and not leave you feeling empty and short-changed then the superb American History X or Marathon Man may be more your scene.The plot and so on is probably heavily disclosed in the reviews contained before and after this, beware reading these may lead you to anticipate the easily predictable ""TWIST"".Disagree with me after seeing all of the suggested movies, I dare you, here is the list again: American History X, Chasing Amy, Marathon Man, Primal Fear and Raging Bull.",0
"I won't spoil the plot for you if I say that ""Fight Club"" is about guys who like to fight each other, no holds barred. I'm an action movie buff, so I thought it might be fun and cartoony. I like Jackie Chan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc. But I hated this film.The violence is very real and awful. There is a lot of pretentious art crap (such as Brad Pitt appearing for brief flickers of time), and the film is similar to war films whose sole purpose is to show you the horror of war. I've got enough problems without psychological trauma, thank you very much.Plus, the characters are incredibly unbelievable. When you fight someone in real life and do real damage, the human reaction is you go to a hospital, you think ow ow ow ow, and you think I'd better stop fighting. No. These guys eat it up and turn it into a hobby. That's psychopathic.Who should see this film:-- film school types: go crazy, have a blast watching the blood-- action movie types with a strong lack of empathy for suffering. And stay away from my daughter.Sorry, but at least I've stated some intelligent reasons for giving Fight Club a worst-of-the-worst 1 out of 10.",0
"I can't believe this shaggy dog of a movie now rests at number #30 on the best movies ever list. Fight Club is so lame that it's not funny.*spoilers*So, the Brad Pitt character doesn't exist. He's just what the Ed Norton character wishes he could be. This means that all them scenes with Norton fighting with Brad Pitt was actually just Norton physically fighting with himself! Huh? And they want us to believe that the fight club began with other guys interested in joining one guy who keeps fighting with himself? If I see a guy fighting with himself, I won't try to join in but run. Run away as fast as possible.The whole basis of the ""story"" is so lame, it's not to be believed. It's equivalent to an entire episode of Star Trek taking place in the freaking Holodeck. It's like an entire season of Dallas brushed off because Bobby's death was all but a dream.There's no emotional pay-off to all the insanity going on screen. And because of this, the whole idea of Norton's dementia, something that could have been emotionally overwhelming, simply becomes tired and cheap. David Fincher's direction is to blame here. He uses layers and layers of cinematic techniques which belie the whole resolution of the story: Norton talking directly to the screen; Norton's annoying voice-over (oh, please stop talking!); the movie begins when the story ends and by the end of the film we are then guided back by Norton to where exactly the ""real"" story began (which is bunk because at the end, Norton is acutely aware that the Tyler is a figment of his imagination and yet throughout the film his voice-over gives no hint that Tyler is not real); tons o' red herrings in the storyline that are there just to hide the fact that there's no story here, folks. Loads of techniques usually reserved for more whimsical stuff simply don't belong here. And add to this pot-pourri of directors' tricks a gazillion gratuitously flashy scenes just to distract the (MTV) jaded audience long enough here and there for nanoseconds and you basically have what Fight Club is: lame.Fincher's direction is set on overkill. Fight Club is an extremely overdirected movie. For instance, the opening credits. Now why the use of crappy, flashy CGI effects when a standard opening credit would have been sufficient? No reason but to be (very) showy. Fight Club is overdirected, overwritten, overacted, overly clever for its own good, over EVERYTHING, with a lame, nonexistent story at its center!",0
"I watched End Of Days directly after this disjointed feature and the Ah'nold piece came out looking like The Godfather!There was a lot of talk when Alien3 came out that David Fincher's limitations as a music video/commercial director would hamper the film's presentation.  I was pleasantly surprised that this ended up not being the case.  Apparently he has decided to devolve into that predicted state.This film was not a bad idea and the acting was good (with what was provided) so that leaves us with the presentation being the problem.  The focus of the film was very disjointed.  The dialogue was vague and an seemed to try too hard and coming up with the next big quotable.  And the cinematography was .... well ... Fincher - if you're going to roll a film that is so colorless, just make it black and white!I'd love to see them remake this movie with some different direction - there was some real potential in it.",0
"... because one cannot sit through this idiocy till the end!  It saddened me to see this film - promising through the first half or so - end up trivializing actual human suffering, in lieu of ""destroying something beautiful.""  Heal, don't hurt - there's too much pain in the world to add to it - is that so hard to fathom?  Hard to believe this rates so high. 4/10",0
"I can't go on. No, I will go on. Fight Club represents one of the worst films I've ever encountered inasmuch it aims for intelligence and subversion but winds up wide of the mark. It's gimmicky and trite and all together pointless. I didn't enjoy it when I first saw it, and now I despise it because some people have elevated it to the level of a masterpiece. Those people are wrong. In trying to address violence in American culture (at least I hope that was the film's intention), the movie fails entirely. It does nothing to subvert the brutal violence on screen or address it in any meaningful manner. Look at Sergio Leone or Sam Peckinpah; they made often violent films that pique the audience's bloodlust only to ultimately undermine that desire for violence. Leone built up the tension and then refused to show you the gore you wanted; Peckinpah slowed it down to the point that the violence became unbearable. Fincher may have wanted to have the same effect on his audience, but he doesn't; the violence in Fight Club is enjoyed by the audience and they keep wanting more. It explores the lure of violence to a degree but then backs off this more thoughtful approach in favor of simply showing the violence. There isn't an attempt made by the filmmakers to question the characters' actions and that seems to me a grave mistake. As for the philosophical elements of this film? They're adolescent beliefs in breaking free of monotony and ennui; the anti-materialist screed, though justified by our culture, is ultimately shallow. It's angry at consumerism and our love of objects (doesn't this movie love gadgetry and gimmickry though?), but it doesn't really show us any alternative, unless the alternative is violence. And, frankly, I'm not willing to accept that. Or maybe the movie's just saying that the dehumanization present in contemporary society could lead to violence. That's okay, but what's the solution. When you have a film that doesn't really look at quasi- fascist ideas in horror, you need to offer us something. This adolescent nihilism is just, well, silly teenage claptrap. It's like this: when I was 15, I love A Clockwork Orange; I'm older now and find the nihilism of its characters as well as its attempts at formulating ideas about society superficial. That's probably what will happen with the majority of this film's supporters. They'll grow up and realize its an adolescent fantasy made by older men who have yet to mature.",0
"Brainless movie tries to make a point, but comes across only as a cinematic failure..... A total waste of time, which is sad, given the admittedly quality performances yet asinine script. The first third is promising, but ultimately this mess of a picture only goes downhill with each brainless sequence that follows.After this picture ended I wanted to erase it from my mind.... reviews on this site are typical of the below 20 group who like quick editing and dumbed down plots that have a ""secret"" message.Overall rating: BOMB REMEMBER: the first rule of fight club is Don't SEE FIGHT CLUB",0
"Two great movies, in my opinion, are `The Game' and `Seven'-- Both directed by David Fincher.  So, obviously, I went into `Fight Club' wanting to love it.  And I did.  Well, the first half, anyway.  From there on, it went straight downhill into just another Hollywood-produced uncreative clone-movie.  I could go in and pin-point the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing, smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that I've seen:  `The Matrix' and `Dark City'.All three of these movies seem to have a common  `new-age' theme.  They all convey the message, `The individual can do anything, and as long as they don 't seek aid  from an outside source, their power is limitless.'  Maybe these Anti-Establishment / Anti-Religion ideals are just a faze in modern media, but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future.As for `Fight Club' on its own, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton play their parts well, and the movie does have some redeeming elements, but overall I can't recommend it.  But, don't let that dissuade you from seeing the movie-- I'd never say, `Don't see this movie'.  You should always see the movie to have an opinion of your own.  Just watch this one with your eyes open.",0
"Yes, these days it's hard to single out a movie as exceedingly dumb, when people rave about crap like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Matrix', but this must take a special prize.  At least in this case, this qualifies as a 'so bad it's good' exercise, whereas the others were just mindless bores.  Of course, it's largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt, who should form a triumvirate with Keanu Reeves as the most overpaid, talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent.  In fact, the only good performance here is by Meatloaf, which is saying a lot.  If you think the plot is original, it's not.  The same idea was presented in a half hour episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' over 30 years ago, that was directed by the master himself. Still, even if it was faked, I did greatly enjoy seeing Pitt and Norton beating each other to a bloody pulp.  They both certainly deserve it for their past (and future) 'work'.",0
"Fight Club is incredibly over-rated. Why? It wasn't the the acting, which was very good, or the direction, which was also true to the story. The problem was with the story and then with the ""twist"" ending. The story had no resonance because, except for the beginning, it wasn't believable as fiction or fantasy. Once our hero (the narrator) moves in with Tyler Durden, everyone in the story serves only the plot elements without ever being believable in their actions.Other fantasy movies like The Matrix, LOTR, Memento, etc. manage to create a fictional world with somewhat believable characters. Some of them manage the ""twist"" ending very well. Memento's twist ending (or was it a twist beginning?) is excellent. Not Fight Club. It only piles on the absurdity.It's clear that the author is violently against materialism, against creature comforts, against middle class values. Hmmm, is he promoting the idea of fighting with others (or yourself) to be free? Naah, not really. Does he actually show the damage a bare knuckle fight would really do? Despite all the blood and relentless smashing of faces, the answer is no. Just a few new bruises the next day and ready for more fighting. Ha! And just what is the message? Blow up the system? Embrace anarchy? Join a cult (or Support Group)? Change the world by spitting (or spewing other bodily fluids) in restaurant food? Who really knows? Maybe it's a good way to let us enjoy lots of brutal violence and make us feel better because there is a valuable and deep philosophy there. Haha! If you want some good, healthy real fighting, watch Pride or UFC fights. After a brutal knock-out of an opponent, a UFC fighter was asked, ""Why do you do this?"" His answer, ""I like beatin' people up!"". Now that's believable!!",0
"This might be the stoopidest movie ever made. The story is ridiculous, the twist beyond retarded.Spoiler ALERTOooh Brad Pitt IS Ed Norton. Is this supposed to be deep?Given what passes as intellectualism and political discourse in this country, it is no wonder that this film is heralded as a masterpiece. I give major props to Fincher for imbuing this piece of idiocy with great style. The lighting and clothes are top -notch. But that does not make for a good movie. I'm sure to teenage bozos, this is about something. To anyone with a brain it is pure dreck.Is that supposed to be funny? Is it supposed to be insightful? What it leaves one with, is a feeling that Brad Pitt sure wishes he was cooler than he is.",0
"The biggest rubbish of all time, this film is fascist, ridiculous, unbelievable, promotes hate and violence, talks about nothing worth being adapted on screen. Again, what is this movie about ? A bipolar man founding a hooligan gang that commits crime in the U.S. Wow, what a waste of time and this is what is wrong with people: people have no taste. The cinematography is terrible, the acting terrible, the characters dull and the dialogue laughable.This is all testosterone and gratuitous violence, scenes that have no relation, no linear coherence.It stinks, it's fascist, it's Sylvester Stallone bull material.",0
"This film starts out good then it just disappoints.  It just gets stupid and stupider.  The first half hour led me to believe it was going to be good. Edward Norton attending support groups for problems and diseases he pretended to have.  Trying to get Seconal for his insomnia.  This film could have been so much better.  By the way, I do not care for Brad Pitt.  Not worth watching.  2/10",0
"My husband talked me into this after time and time again saying ""I don't want to watch a movie about fighting"", I guess he thought the beginning was better than I thought it was...I guess if you get kicks out of people whose lives are completely the dumps then watch this movie.  It's only mildly amusing before the fighting if you're a mentally stable person.",0
"This movie is not that good. After seeing this movie, I wouldn't ever pay cash money to see this again. I will never rent this movie again. I probably wouldn't watch it on TV if it came on. It's really that bad. $3.50 is not worth watching this movie. Do not rent it. It is awful. My reason for this opinion is the fact that it doesn't make sense in most scenes. The part where he's burning his hand is fairly impossible. The ending is really bad. I mean, it's so bad that I almost threw a flower pot at the TV screen. And don't be misled by the title. It's not really about a fight club, it's about something more absurd. Edward Norton did the best job he could with this lousy script, and even Brad Pitt did a mediocre job. The surprise ending is nothing like The Sixth Sense. I'd rather see that movie twenty more times rather than see 5 minutes from Fight Club. I've read some comments about this movie, and I don't know what you guys are talking about. It's not that good. Some plot twists does not make for good movie making. This movie is on the level of Judge Dredd. No wait, Judge Dredd isn't this bad.",0
"...signifying nothing.""  Nah, it wasn't that bad, just terrifically disappointing.  The movie's first half hour does a great job exploring the hollow nature of modern life, such as the scene where Norton's living room is gradually ""furnished"" with items right out of the catalog, complete with their price and description.  Yes, we've seen it before, but Norton's performance in the first part of the film brings the script to life.  And then along comes a solid dose of Hollywood machismo, wrapped up in a buff, Brad Pitt package.  Now here's what I have a real problem with: all these young men find salvation through beating each other senseless. Okay, athletic competition has long served that purpose; remember varsity football? But it only goes so far...and the movie's only half over.  What does that leave: a paramilitary organization (!?!?), a weak ending, and an attempt to turn bonding-through-brutality into a way of life. No doubt, it sells tickets, but it defeats its own purpose. Norton's character has been destroyed by modern life; it's a shame that all that's left him is destroying others' bodies. And apartments. And credit ratings. Ho hum.",0
"Arguably, nihilism in films is best personified by David Fincher, who in only three films has already set his stamp on filmmaking.  Of course, we didn't realize this until his second film which is the now classic ""Seven."" But in retrospect ""Seven "" was as bleak and despairing as anything done in mainstream cinema, and it was a Hollywood thriller no less.  Then came ""The Game,"" a disappointment, but with the intriguing premise of a bottled-up and unemotional man who in the course of his nightmarish ""game"" learns to live again.  ""Carpe Diem"" a la Kafka.  This same premise is put into a societal point of view with ""Fight Club.""This is also Fincher's first literary adaptation.  ""Fight Club"" comes to us via the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk.  The film relates the story of a successful, yet depressed young man (Edward Norton) who has become an insomniac.  He has a swanky apartment, catalog-ordered furniture, and a respectable position in a firm, yet he feels like he is missing out on life. He can't feel emotion anymore.  On a whim, he visits a cancer-crisis group and bonds with Bob, played by Meatloaf, who now has breasts because of a rare cancer (insert laughter here).  This bonding and emotional intimacy leads to catharsis and release, especially when he weeps between Bob's ample breasts.  Not surprisingly, Norton sleeps well.Things are moving along great.  Never mind that he's using these victims as emotional pumps, the point is he feels again.  Then comes an uninvited femme fatale played with unabashed scuzziness by Helena Bonham-Carter...and she used to do Merchant-Ivory?Because of this fellow emotional sponge, Norton must look elsewhere. Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): Soap salesman and excrement chef who urinates in his customers' soups.  These two bond by beating the crap out of each other. ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can, "" Durden says.  Norton obliges by punching his ear.Soon though, a friendship is formed and Norton loses his pad thanks to a freak fire.  Norton stays with Durden and the two continue to pummel each other.  Naturallly, other men gravitate.  Finally, a club is established in which white-collar, civil, and cultured gentlemen become primal gladiators in a self-imposed ring.  The object:  Fight so one can feel masculine again.As with anything purely physical (and make no mistake that is exactly what it is) Durden decides to up the ante a tad and create a full-fledged urban terrorism group.  Nihilism by way of Fascism.  You see, ""Fight Club"" is about destroying the modern spineless society so that men can go back to what they truly are, hunters.  Only problem is where does one draw the line?First off, the positive.  ""Fight Club"" is technically brilliant. Audacious and stylistic, Fincher plays with our tale being told by Norton's narrator. So Norton talks directly to the camera, stops the film for a bit of background information on characters, and lets other characters comment as well.  Durden explaining his story is hilarious and twisted.  The camera swoops into Norton's brain at one point and we take a stroll around his pad even seeing the price for each item.  The energy is infectious and the acting by all the principles, especially Norton and Carter are top-notch.Is there any negative?  Yep.I felt dirty watching this film.  I felt the same way when watching ""Natural Born Killers.""  Yes, it was satire as I'm sure ""Fight Club"" is as well. But the satire seems to be unfocused.  What  exactly is the point of seeing guys pummel each other and pick fights with innocents?  Does Fincher support the premise of violence to save souls or are they all doomed anyway?  And I must be getting soft, but there were scenes that grossed me out, specifically the human fat scene (Don't ask).  Satire does not work by exaggeration alone; there needs to be purpose.  That's something ""A Clockwork Orange"" had. Yes, it was violent and disturbing.  But there was a point to the film. Science cannot curb man's morality nor should it.  What does ""Fight Club"" say, let's all revert back to cavemen?  Sorry, not interested.The ending is just plain dumb.  I will not reveal anything, but be prepared for pretension deluxe.A friend of mine compared this film to ""American Beauty"" saying that both films dealt with changing one's humdrum existence into a life full of meaning.  But ""Beauty"" had something that ""Fight Club"" lacked.  Humanity. At the end of ""Beauty"", Lester Burnham thinks he has found purpose in enjoying life again, but he realizes that his life had purpose all along because of his family.  Burnham comes full circle.  We never get that kind of revelation in ""Club.""  The selfishness in achieving nirvana through nihilism remains and a hollowness remains at the film's center.Fincher's movies are disturbing, that's just a given.  But their saving grace, especially in the case of ""Seven,"" is their imagination and story. ""Fight Club"" has its imagination as well.  However, because of its trite story, I can't say it was a saving anything.",0
"Admittedly, I would have never gone to see Fight Club if it hadn't been part of a class I'm taking at USC, but this film makes you wonder what it takes for the MPAA not to give a film an R rating. It's so gratuitously violent and downright gross (even in non-violent scenes) that Pulp Fiction looks tame by comparison.Seriously, it's hyped as a violent film about non-violence, but isn't that akin to saying a film with gratuitous sex can be about abstinence. Sure, I guess it could, but you'd be hard pressed to find an example, just as I find it hard to believe that anyone honestly thinks this film is more than a glorified Faces Of Death with big name actors.I don't know what else to say, but keep your kids (and yourself) away from this film.",0
"A day after the experience, I am still trying to reconcile how the man who was responsible for the magnificent subtlety of ""Seven"" could create such garbage.  Yes, the violence was gratuitous and excessive, but oddly enough that was the least of this films worries.Where to begin?  The plot was ridiculous on it's face, absolutely incoherent and nonsensical.  The various themes of the movie were amplified and remarkably shallow, showing no real insight into the problems of our society.  Ours is an overly commercial culture?  This is neither original nor especially interesting, especially when repeated ad nauseam.Fincher's direction and sophomoric MTV-style presentation did nothing to help a script that never got any further than ""live free or die"" (with minor variations).  Most of the dialogue reminded me of something my high school English teacher used to say when her students ventured out of their league: ""That's so deep it's shallow"".  This succinctly describes the handling of every major theme in the film.Then there are the performances.  Edward Norton, an otherwise gifted actor, does little with the simplistic character he's given.  There is no complexity to this character whatsoever and Norton can do nothing to help define him.  His early attempts at playing the neurotic are particularly unconvincing.  Brad Pitt has more to work with in the Tyler Durden character, but his tendency to overplay absolutely everything about his character (even beyond what the script calls for, or should have called for) makes Norton's performance seem that much more vapid.  Helena Bonham Carter simply showed up; throughout the movie, one had the feeling that she desperately wanted to be somewhere else.  It seems hard to blame her.Had this been the work of any number of other directors I could name, it would be easy to dismiss the overheated message of this film.  Fincher is capable of such subtlety and craftsmanship that it is hard to believe he could put his name to such a juvenile, simplistic film.  One hopes that ""Seven"" is not the only thing of beauty we see from Mr. Fincher.",0
"I know everyone is saying that this movie is great, it has so much to say about society, the script is so good, blah blah blah. For the first time in my life, however, I was motivated actually to get up and to leave the theatre in the middle of the film. Yes, the movie has a message beyond ""fighting is good"", but it is just so in-your-face that I couldn't take any more after the first hour. It did not help that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, even though I don't have a problem with Brad, Edward, or Helena generally. Anyone who saw this movie and came away wondering exactly what the director was trying to say must have been asleep. I don't think that a film has to be completely offensive to make a point. Of course this is only my opinion! I know there is supposedly a plot twist at the end, and whatever it was, it just could not have been worth another hour and a half of this film to get to it.By the way I have seen other ""offensive"" movies and enjoyed them, Natural Born Killers being one of them, so I am not just being a weenie about the whole thing. I liked Se7en, and I completely loved The Game, but this one just is not up to their standards. See one of these movies instead if you have never seen a Fincher film before.",0
A flop just about everywhere.critics talk as though its a classic.i thought it was the pits.Edward Norton voice drove me mad i hate voiceovers.was there a point to the movie.some weirdos may get some crazy ideas from it.a movie this bad deserves no praise.a case of the emperors new clothes if ever i saw one.,0
"...in which pretty much the only aspect that doesn't totally disappoint is the cinematography (basically an elaboration of the set design on ""Seven""). Even the soundtrack is lukewarm and sounds horribly dated (some ""brothers"" or someone). Norton is the kind of actor whom you either can or cannot watch (I haven't totally decided yet), Bonham Carter still delivers a phoney stateside accent (Woody Allen obviously hasn't helped), and Pitt only looks good in his eye to eye hotel room sequence with Norton (anyone who claims they see him as a good actor is either lying or is deluded - the guy just looks good with cropped hair). Other than this we're looking at a film made for awkward teenage boys who can't watch it anyway cause it's mostly rated 18. It's the slightly older awkward boys who sadly do get to see it and end up slobbering over it and writing rave reviews about it. A little rubbish goes a long way these days.Having appreciated both ""The Game"" and especially ""Seven"", I'd like to think Fincher was presented with a job to be done and got away with it. Let's see what happens next.",0
"I am back for my second review of Fight Club. Why, you ask? Because I  was told I had an ""inadequate"" amount of evidence to prove my point! So  here I go.  Fight Club is a very strange, erratic movie that, quite honestly,  nearly put me to sleep within the first ten minutes. It seemed that the  whole movie revolved around an insomniac! And that's true--this movie  is about nothing but a guy who can't sleep. For over half of it seems  to be the very first movie that has no plot, no decent characters (what  kind of main character is known only as ""The Narrator""?), and a crummy  soundtrack. I was SO disappointed.  ""Plot Outline: A man disillusioned by what his life has become  encounters an exciting stranger who introduces him to a new way of  life.""  Well, yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but this new way of life doesn't  come in until WAY later. And once Fight Club is finally introduced, it  is hardly shown. Then it turns into a macho group of terrorists... I'm  sorry, but how utterly boring! From the commercials and video cover, I  was expecting there to be a plot that revolved around the Fight Club.  Instead, I was slapped in the face with this stupid terrorist group  that doesn't serve a purpose.  I now have to go to Helena Bonham Carter. Hey, lady, you did excellent  in Planet of the Apes! But in this movie she plays as a rival  counseling group member (speaking of which, what purpose do these  groups serve for the movie?  NOTHING!  The final conflict, in which The Narrator (boy, that name is just so  cool) is fighting ""himself"", is utterly pathetic. How boring. And then  the buildings topple... and that's the end. Ho! Wait! I see a naked man  from the waist down at the ending! Maybe this is the second reason  people liked this stupid, boring movie so much. It shows both female  AND male anatomy.  How stupid! Repulsive! I DESPISED this movie. Now you know why. If, in  fact, you STILL don't understand, listen closely:  1. Boring 2. No plot (adds to number 1) 3. Shallow characters 4. Actual  film has hardly anything to do with its title 5. Constant  swearing/nudity that sickened me 6. Music was cruddy  Basically, this film reeked of anything but stupidity. I was so sick of  it before the first half hour was up.  I will never watch it again. And I hope my review will help keep you  from watching it as well.",0
"First, the good stuff.  The acting was superb.  Edward Norton was very strong (though I expected more, somehow) and Brad Pitt was a phenomenon. I'm glad Sean Penn pulled out of this role, though I'm sure he would have nailed it as well (and in a very different way, I'll bet).  The direction was also interesting, though it seemed like the director was enjoying himself to much.  So much of it seemed like the ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" style of direction.Now, the bad stuff.  This plot is more full of holes than Independence Day. I mean, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Other reviewers have said that if you go to this movie, you must be prepared to think.  Very true, you must think about the film's themes and the film's subtext every step of the way.  This was extremely interesting and enjoyable.  But whatever you do, please do not think about the plot.  It doesn't hold up under any scrutiny at all.  At a very basic level, this film doesn't make sense.  I can't elaborate without throwing out a huge spoiler, so I won't.If you ask me, plot is the first thing.  If you have a weak plot, that can be forgiven by other strengths.  But if your plot can't even stand up without the willful indulgence of a forgiving audience, then you've already fouled up too big to ignore.  This movie could not have been good without massive script alterations.  No matter how good the acting, how good the directing, how clever the dialogue, this movie could not have been other than a travesty of modern film.  Horrible.On the other hand, from the number of posters here who seem to think that Edward Norton's character was named Jack, it's quite clear that people indeed don't pay very close attention to films.  No wonder this film is so highly regarded.",0
"If senseless violence and acrimonius rage are your idea of a good time, get help.  This movie is profound rage and mind numbing horses*** with no plot, a cynical theme, and nihilistic metaphysical worldview.  I thought it may have been about boxing clubs, not hypo-manic arsonist with dark visions of paranoid delusion.  Hours passed by without any meaning.",0
"I wasted $6.50 tonight seeing Fight Club.  I plan on returning to the theatre tomorrow and requesting a refund from the manager because I do not want my dollars supporting such a movie.  I would call it a film, but it does not deserve such an honor.  The best way I can describe this movie is to say that I came away from it feeling visually and mentally raped.  It was thoroughly violent, but violence is not what offended me most.  The violence for violence' sake offended me.  The pointlessness of the movie offended me. The ""God hates you"" dialogue offended me.  I was glad to see that 2 other people had already agreed with me and given the movie a rating of 1.  Do not waste your money on this movie.  Do not waste your time on this movie.  Brad Pitt fans - resist the urge to see this attack on your self-worth and intelligence. I could go on, but you get the picture.  Fight Club - Stay Away.",0
"If the boring one hour narrative introduction by Edward Norton doesn't put you to sleep, the next two hours of Brad Pitts horrible overacting, gross absurd scenes, and a completely pathetic plot will make you want to puke. Of the thousands of films I have seen in my life, only two have been so bad that I could not sit through the entire film. Fight Club is one of those two movies.",0
I have just finished watching FIGHT CLUB. Simply put: it is the most profoundly depraved and deeply disturbing film I can ever remember seeing. If our culture was not crumbling at a full gallop we would see this vile and wicked film for what it is. Could such a film have been made even twenty years ago? Will anyone care or even take notice of such a film twenty years from now! We are lost.,0
"Quite unfortunate.  I respect most of the people in this movie, and they do show some good acting chops in this movie.  Unfortunately, it's a pale screenplay directed with no distinction.  Ed Norton had already done a brilliant movie about fascist-wannabes with ""American X,"" so what was the point of getting involved in this mess?  Norton deserved better, as did Pitt, Bonham-Carter and Leto.  Sad - I was hoping for a meditation for modern life and the culture of violence.  I guess I'll just have to go back to ""American History X"" and ""Natural Born Killers.""",0
"David Fincher. I think his career might have been a tragedy if he actually made some good early films. He had alot of promise but is now sucked into the world of the fanboy where he reins as their god. This world is made up of angry youth, most of whom like computers, violence, and sex, though they are underexperienced with it in actuality. No more evident is this than in Fight Club. If you need proof read one of the hundred claims that this is the pinnacle of filmmaking. Since these people are cultish and do not listen to reasonable argument, I will waste so much time as to actually give the entire argument against this film, as I see it.I think Fincher actually had a message, however he has no control over his own abilities. I think using logic his film is about the value of the individual. This is extremely ironic, since his film has inspired homogenous worshipers. The first third of the film is a damnation of the working environment. The last third is, I'm guessing, supposed to be a damnation of the second third. The second third is the escape from the working class through a violent cult. This is only the most logical explanation, for me anyway. I think many people fail to see the last third as a damnation of the second third because Fincher creates it as such a paradise juxtaposed next to the working week. Fincher is too seduced by his own tricks that he can't convey his own message, and we as viewers are left with the remnants of a very negative film with no purpose for it's violent, destructive nature and no redeeming values at all. So maybe it isn't what the film is about. Most of it's fans would gladly join up with the cult and follow Tyler into chaos. The message of the film is really quite hollow. And the way it is done is just silly. 3/10",0
"Note to Mr. Pitt: Dark glasses and a scruffy somewhat swollen face isn't working. We understand you're a male actor (and I'm certain a good spirit) with pretty much a pick of the A list in tinsletown, but cut your losses,kiddo. Golden Boy ain't so bad a draw. Hey,I'd welcome you into my own dilapidated boudoir anytime,bright yellow Playtex gloves or not,but on screen,keep it simple. I think girls prefer you that way too.Question for Mr. Fincher: Are you too hip for your own good, or not enough to know better?I escaped with barely a bruise to my patience after an hour and ten minutes,feeling immediate relief in dusk's warm radiance while fleeing homeward,convinced once more that reality is so much hipper than Hollywood spends so many billions contriving it to be otherwise.",0
"Big strong handsome boys take their shirts off and sweat and fight eachother! Oh boy! Oh yeah, there's a girl in here too (Helena BonhamCarter) but she kind of acts tough like a guy too. Lots of posing andposturing in this film, it's very 'cool'. I found it hollow and couldcare less. Clockwork Orange said it better and was better acted 40 yearsago. Rent that one instead.",0
"This is one of the silliest movies I have ever seen.It is not only not credible that such clubs exist; the motivation of the characters in this film to act the way they do is simply not believable.Having said that the performances are quite good. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton always deliver consistent well rounded performances. It is unfortunate that their efforts are wasted here due to an unsatisfactory script and an incredible plot line.The ending of the film is especially unsatisfying and .... well, weird. I guess one should have expected that from the lengthy period of grief that precedes it. The performances probably rate more than a 2 rating, but I think it deserves a rap on the knuckles just in case someone wants to make Fight Club II",0
"I can't stand this movie. In and of itself, it's just a mediocre male power fantasy movie for privileged adolescents who feel misunderstood. However, too many grown men take this movie seriously and fawn over its wholly unremarkable and tedious semi-philosophical implications. In fact, I would recommend using this movie as a metric to avoid obnoxious people before you become too involved with them.The movie takes nearly two and a half hours to say ""work sucks!!! no one pays attention to me at the office!!! everyone around me is a chump!!!"" which would be just fine except that the movie is so incredibly misogynistic. The only woman in the movie with any role in the plot is Helena Bonham Carter's character who exists solely as an object of Edward Norton's fantasies. This kind of narrative is entirely unnecessary and at best mind numbingly boring (if not dangerous to an individual's perceptions of women and femininity). The values and glorifications in this movie are toxic and shallow.Not to mention how utterly unbelievable this whole story is. Why in the world would grown men want to just spend their time fighting each other? Why would a group of guys leaving a bar want to join in a fight that they came across in the street? Why would men who did enjoy fighting make the whole affair into a nihilistic cult? None of that is ever explained; we're meant to take for granted that men would just be interested in fighting for no discernible reason other than they're unhappy with their employment and credit scores.This movie was made by and for pretentious self involved clowns and an undeniable waste of time.",0
"I saw this film at the Cinerama Dome on Sunset Strip in Hollywood when it was first released. I am upset with myself for not walking out in the middle and demanding my money back. I stayed and gave it a chance ,to my utter dismay. This foul piece of crap is one of the worst films I have ever seen.I get more pleasure out of deliberately bad films like "" Plan 9 from Outer Space"" "" Fight Club "" actually masquerades as something artistic. Meatloaf discarded any dignity or self-respect he might possess by accepting this pathetic role.Aside from the sick( I don't mean the current vernacular) premise and the idiotic plot, the fact that morons are out there now, beating the hell out of each other in basements, as a form of mimicry and tribute, is disgusting to me.An abomination of a movie.",0
"Fight Club could have been a great film with the amazing plot idea, but it falls very short of what it could have been. What redeems this movie from complete BOMB-dom is the acting and the seldom black comedy. The movie has poor to O.K. directing. The movie is way over-long and has one of the worst endings ever filmed in history. The violence is supposed to shock but that also falls short. All in all I would stay away from this movie.",0
"Also one of the 10 worst films of all time.  Are we sure Ed Wood is dead, because I swear he must have written, cast, and directed this major turkey. If people claim not to understand this film, it's merely because they have an IQ of 3.  I even read one critique by someone who watches this bomb every week!  Talk about not having a life!  There was a half hour episode of Alfred Hitchcock's series that had the same plot and was 100 times better than this.  As to the acting, well I couldn't find anyone doing that here, but then Ed Norton is one of the worst actors alive today (as is Pitt), so you shouldn't be surprised there.  Meatloaf was the only person even trying, but then he was saddled with an incredibly moronic script written by a 2 year old.",0
If director David Fincher wanted us to honestly believe that we have not evolved one bit from the scum that at one point inhabited this earth than he has brillantly done it. The first problem I have with this film is that it drags on about a half an hour to long and trust me that half an hour at the end could possibly be the stuipidest ending ever. What starts off as a promising look at a bunch of low lives letting off some stream by beating the hell out of each other (mainly due to the always great Edward Norton) slowing take a nose dive into pure stupidity. This movie becomes so trashy I had to take a shower directly after watching it to feel clean again. The main problem with this film is that there is only about 15 minutes of fighting the rest is a bunch of losers running around the city destroying things and then turns into a comptly unbeliveable ghost story. The film is not a complete watse though due to several amusing scene in Which Ed Norton punches Brad Pitt in the ear and when Pitt edits images of male genitalia into childrens movies. But besides that this could very well be the worst movie I've ever seen. So unless there is absolutly no other options steer clear of this trashy mess.,0
"This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  I hear it's supposed to appeal to my generation (I'm 22), since we've been brought up on a diet of senseless violence and MTV.  Now, I don't automatically think there's anything wrong with violence in movies, as long as there's some justification for it, and I like watching MTV (when they actually play videos), but I found this film terrible.  Up until about the middle of the movie, there might have been a chance for this movie to find itself and deliver some real social commentary (which is the only possible reason other then pure, sick voyeurism that might justify the horrific violence). Unfortunately, ""Fight Club"" then took a turn for the worse, not for the better, and delivered an even more bizarre, more violent ending.  Save your money: something--ANYTHING--on TV or at the $1.75 movie theater is better than this.",0
"And what a waste of talents?. and my time. Yes, the movie does have some fancy camera work. But I consider David Fincher would be more successful to be a TV commercial producer than a movie director. From Seven to Fight Club, I don't see any growth in his filmmaking. Dark and grotesque as usual (or even more) but his movies absolutely has no emotional impact on me, excepts the unpleasant after taste.",0
"How can we get Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Meatloaf to beat the c**p out of each other? This movie solves that ""problem,"" and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in pseudo-philosophies and violence.In this flawed film, I understand that it was any of: a)a group of young men rebelling against a Borgeousie consumerism society. b)one man seeing how he is totally dissatisfied with life and how his mind tries to change things or c)people stopping to watch Cornelius fight himself because voyeurism is human nature the film makes a deliberate attempt to make the viewer feel guilty for being a voyeur. (I'll come to that later)",0
"!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!!!The premise of a lonely aimless soul attending cancer therapy groups and AA meetings might have been savagely funny if done right but here it`s badly executed as the first 20 minutes is taken up with Ed Norton droning on in an over literary voice over . I know a cinematic masterwork like APOCALYPSE NOW used voice over but so did THE DUKES OF HAZZARD so it`s just as likely to be the work of a buffoon than a genius . The themes of male grief , alienation and the back lash against 80s consumerism are just as badly developed 
FIGHT CLUB is good in parts like the scene where the members cover a car park with bird seed so that the pigeons s*hit all over the new cars , but the film is unworthy of the praise lavished upon it by large sections of IMDB voters . I can imagine 17 year old males loving this film - I`d be shocked if they didn`t - but for anyone else who`s old enough to have more mature and critical views should be able to recognise this as one extremely overlong overrated one trick pony . As for the metaphysical twist ending it just doesn`t make sense and brings the whole proceedings down . The narrator was beating himself up was he ? Yeah right .If FIGHT CLUB is the masterpiece  it`s supposed to be then how come it was virtually ignored at the Oscars in one of the weakest years for films in a long time ?",0
"On one level, this movie entertains, making you laugh with sharp and witty dialogue, irony and utter insanity of the plot.  On another level, as a film - as art, it fails miserably.This is the kind of movie you should watch with a relative detachment, because there's no reason to actually delve into the philosophy.  The point of the movie (if there is one) is simply to entertain the audience.  If the director/screenwriter/producer/cast meant it to be deeper, it got lost in the parody.I will admit that I was very entertained by the performances of all the leads, and even Meat Loaf was fun to watch in his small role.  However, this does not make up for the fact that Fight Club tries to play with your mind and give a new spin on random subjects like mass media, masculinity/violence, and society when in fact it spreads itself too thin and through the conclusion of the movie completely sullies whatever decent arguments it had.Bottom line: Watch it for pure fun, no more.  There is no hidden treasure here.",0
How do you know you're crazy?When your masculine side is banging your feminine side and all you can do is listen.This highly regarded film is nihilistic garbage. Offensive and pretentious. All attitude and Jungian stereotypes. Skip it.,0
"A difficult to understand film, that borders boring at some points, the fact that it has such a high rating is quite mind boggling. At some points interesting, but not the most thrilling piece of cinematography that I've seen, plays with the psychological aspects of humanity, and in the end is a confusing expo of a delusional persons realty, illustrated through ""fighting"" with ones self and then recruiting others to demonstrate similar violence as if it were to contribute in the bettering of individuals who ultimately degenerate in a seudo-terrorist activity and is only ended when one of the two polarities of the protagonist, causes a shot to his head, ending the personal torture of enduring this film.",0
"...but ""Fight Club"" is much more intriguing in its smaller moments, where it finds a surreal, dream-like quality that seems to snake around at will. The film is tough and unyielding in its machismo, and although it is occasionally off-putting, I was never bored watching it. The acting, by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in particular, is quite good; the two stars have obviously been put through the wringer in their roles, and director David Fincher keeps cranking up the tension and puts us through the wringer as well. But I felt the filmmakers slipped at the final gate, wherein the script concocts a major plot-twist that just doesn't jell, leading everyone to look a little foolish. **1/2 from ****",0
"As nonsensical as The Game. As hollow as American Beauty. A loud, flashy, messy, bore that had me watching the clock in anticipation of when this movie would end, and so end my misery.This and American Beauty are among the biggest copouts in movie history. Cynical Hollywood manipulations that make fools of their fans.Within the theatre walls, we vent vicariously with the main characters about the evils of consumerism, then what do we do after the credits roll? Eight dollars poorer, having enriched and empowered the Entertainment System, we go back to the very lives these movies condemn.Now we can even browse through the IKEA catalog without guilt, because in spirit we have joined the Fight Club.Is living the lie okay just because you admit it? More hypocritical moviemaking for hypocritical moviegoers--yet another turn of the money-go-round.",0
"Fight Club is that one film you always hear about in colleges and universities, hailed as some sort of 'stick it to the man rebellion' story with all these pretentious meanings that apparently need to be analyzed in great depth to the point where I can't start a conversation about films without hearing Fight Club come up at least once. Pseudo-intellectuals, perverts, frat boys and emos all get obsessed with this one like moths to a flame. Of course, it would be the most spoiled, coddled and secure of society's demographic that enjoy Fight Club because they say it speaks so much to the hurt and anger they apparently experience on a day-to-day basis. I'm sure they'd change their tune and perhaps value humanity over themselves more if they'd grown up in earlier eras, but that's getting rather off-topic.Fight Club is not a terrible film. It has interesting characters, a decent plot and it follows the original book very well. The soundtrack is dated, the themes are dated, the dialogue is vulgar simply for the sake of being vulgar, and the entire thing as a whole is just trying way too hard to appeal to a certain type of entitled, self-absorbed and immature Generation X/ Millennial crowd (although really I think films are subjective and can be enjoyed by anyone). Fight Club is offensive in every sense of the word, disgustingly crass at times, weird, overly long, and yet I still liked it - but I think it's incredibly overrated for what it is, and I don't think the viewers of it really seem to grasp the full idea it was trying to put out there.The film is more or less a very nihilistic portrayal of a young man rebelling against modern corporate capitalism and society in general by forming an underground fight club with his SPOILER ALERT!!! imaginary friend and alter-ego Tyler Durden. Durden is a character, but at the same time an embodiment of everything bad, wasteful, annoying, volatile, cruel, narcissist and utterly pointless albeit intellectual that the main character himself is putting out into the world by his own attitude. Anarchy and rebellion, and the aftermath of them, remains one of the biggest themes in Fight Club alongside being an entertaining comedy. However, many viewers of the film just pick up on the vulgar one-liners about women and masturbation and sex, the heavy violence and Tyler's selfish view that humans exist to please themselves, not to care about others, and that the world, everything and everyone in it is just a game to be played. Viewers of Fight Club I've noticed retain the idea that if you show emotion, compassion, pity, sadness or kindness, you're an overly sensitive baby. ""Real men"" cause chaos, have sex constantly, swear their mouths off, go out of their way to offend others and don't give a damn about anyone else but #1. And naturally, when the main character grows up and matures slightly in the end, people find this confusing. Basically, the main character thought he knew how cruel and ugly the world was, but he was just a bored kid and a hypocrite. In fact, the majority of young adults are hypocrites who think the world revolves around them and their views. I was that way when I was that age, too. I went through a ""pro-pollution"" phase where I littered on purpose and refused to recycle. Why? Just to stir up trouble. I went through a goth phase where I wore black lipstick and thick black eye makeup to make a panda bear green with envy. Why? Just for shock value and to tick off my teachers. I went through an emo phase, cutting my arms with plastic cutlery and dying my hair black with pink streaks, listening to depressing music and whining about being depressed, while the popular blonde cheerleader sitting in the desk next to mine really WAS suicidal and it went totally unnoticed. Why? Because I was too wrapped up in my own teenage angst garbage to bother helping anyone or anything else. I wanted attention, I wanted to be noticed, but looking back on it a few years later, I realize how insignificant it all is. All teenagers are dumb. I have never come across an intelligent teenager. I've come across many intellectual teenagers, but not intelligent ones. Durden is exactly the figure most teenagers, teenage guys and college guys especially, emulate....Okay, that's really getting repetitive now. Like the films 'Donnie Darko' and 'A Clockwork Orange', I think the themes of chaos, nihilism and anarchy are important, but Fight Club is so overrated for what it is. How it has such a high rating over films like 'The Killing Fields' and 'Threads', I'll never understand. Reviewers keep raving about its aesthetics and its depth, but it's no more deep than many other films. ANY film with a social commentary is considered ""deep"". Fight Club I think just hit the world at the right time, plus it's making a comeback for many nostalgic hipsters, so it will definitely continue to be highly regarded for many years to come, which is not necessarily a bad thing, yet Fight Club shares what, exactly, with the world? Young adults are jerks? Have I missed some vital bit of info to make Fight Club so popular and beloved, or what?",0
"Fight Club would lead you to believe that is an action thriller, which has excitement in it and keeps you gripped until then end! Well, let's just say this film could save the NHS a fortune in sedatives! Edward Norton, an amazingly talented actor! His talent is mirrored in films such as American History X and so on. Films where his talent is actually apparent! I sat until the end of the film thinking ""Ok, anytime soon it will get exciting!"" It was so obvious they way the film was going to go and took a very long time to get there. Why anyone would cast Helena Bonham Carter is also beyond me! Brad Pitt is an OK actor, but is blessed with looks (apparently) more than he is talent! So many people have claimed how amazing this film is but I just do not see it! A few predictable twists and turns, and the climax at the end is neither here nor there. As bad endings go, this is one of the worst I have seen!GLAD I DID NOT PAY TO SEE THIS IN THE CINEMA! IF YOU NEED SOMETHING TO KNOCK YOU TO SLEEP, CHECK THIS OUT!!!!",0
"When the movie was half way through all my friends wanted to turn it off. I refused because I had heard it was a fantastic ending. We saw the movie through, but it only got worse. I can't see anything uplifting about this movie. I'd rather see the Matrix.",0
"`Fight Club' 0*.  Anarchy takes a well-trained and organized army.  Peace requires using 19th century technology to end 20th century technology, thereby blowing us all back into the 18th century.  Of course this all leads to great sex and a cure for demons inside you.  And, along the way you can beat the hell out of a bunch testosterone leaden fellow travelers.  A really dumb movie.  Bad acting and some of the most boring cinematography of 1999. Skip this one.",0
"Despite remarkable acting, this movie is not worth the extraordinarily long time it took to get through it.  This testosterone laden tale contains a semi-interesting twist toward the end, but even that can't make up for the cliche filled, ""you are what you own"" lame attempt at a moral message.  Don't waste your time.",0
"It's amazing that anyone thought this was watch-able, never mind brilliant. The acting, camera work and music are all good, but the story is so absurd, it had me laughing out loud. I can understand that a fight club could come to be, but this story has it wrapped up in anti-consumerism ? and other heady subjects. It just doesn't fly. Show me one backyard boxing enthusiast with these intellectual ideals. They're in it for the fighting. At least show me how the first fight club member was inducted. Two guys start it and the next thing you know there are a hundred members willing to die for their leader. When did that and happen and how? These are huge unanswered questions and without the answers it makes the whole thing seem so implausible that I could not suspend my disbelief.The thing about the body organs was shoe-horned in to give some novel-like cohesiveness, but when they transferred it using statements like, ""This is Jack's complete lack of surprise,"" it became a ridiculous sophomoric device. The attempts at humor were embarrassing. It's good to add some humor to lighten the tension, but here the gags seemed to be dropped in from a Farrelly Brothers movie and were so out-of-place that it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis. Also, the gags were childish and weren't funny. Helena Bonham Carter's character was not only completely unbelievable, but also superfluous. The character could be removed and the overall story would not change one bit. So, why is this character here? I found all the characters to be unbelievable and absurd. Their motivations and dialog made little or no sense at all. Sometimes the dialog and narration seemed to be selected just to make a character say something provocative, even if it made no sense. The scenes where Ed Norton was beating himself up was like watching a MST3K episode, only I was filling in the commentary. And near the end we get a bizarre twist that's really just a cheap trick by the filmmaker. I felt cheated because I was led down a path without enough information to put together the reality. In ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"", they left the door open, so at the end you realize all the info was there. In ""Fight Club"" you are summarily duped. Overall, this film seems like the work of an edgy high school student ? all style, no substance and a bunch of quirky, edgy characters that couldn't possibly exist.",0
"I started out enjoying this film immensely. Following the first half hour, however, it has already stated everything that it has to say. For the remainder of the film it merely repeats itself over and over and over and over.
To write more on the film would be to commit the same sin.",0
You might need more than a little MENTAL HELP; if YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE.... mentally people would want the time spent watching this movie back. If you like this one see Pulp fiction.....it might be more landfill material you would enjoy watching.,0
The plot is probably written by a three year old kid. Really bad movie for me!,0
"I understand that the purpose of this film is brilliant but it is made so poorly and most of it was so boring ; the movie is too long , i kept checking my watch throughout the whole movie.
I think this would make a better book than a film and I would recommend you to read the book or to read about the story before even watching this film , because it was misleading to the point , and wasn't clear at all.",0
"What a pretentious and loathsome movie! Cultural anthropologists are surely having a good laugh at this film's notion that men are only true to their nature when they are violent. The fact that this trash will make money is a sad comment on our society. As pitiful and horrifying as the ""Tough Man"" contests are, THEY are more entertaining than this dreck! In addition, Brad Pitt is a real stiff, and why was he wearing Ratso Rizzo's clothing?",0
"This highly pretentious film is written by an intellectual weakling, designed for those to aspire to this. The plot makes no sense and the 'clever' finale is drivel. To absorb any meaning from this would require the classic media studies student who, used to not understanding and undeservedly praising most cretinous films, takes this abstract twist to be a clever comment on the state of society (or something of the sort). In term of enjoyment, fight club undoubtedly gets a 0, surely even for those supposedly engrossed in the nonsensical intricacies of it, and a small role from meat loaf heightens the sense of disappointment in conjunction with a slight feeling of nausea. Avoid at all costs",0
"This film, has to be different then the book. I notice the production cost and theater gross are way off. Which is what makes the most sense of this film. This makes Kubricks 2001, a Masterpiece. Criminals should have time taken off their sentence, if they can sit through this more then once. Some great movies do need to be seen 2 or 3 times to understand everything, and it is worth it. Obviously not this. Someone thought they were being real dynamic, deep, brilliant putting this ""thing"" together. When they were on LSD it seemed like the answer to the meaning of life. When they came down it was silly nonsense. Too late, the film was ""in the can"". It belongs in an ashcan. I am sure there are many people who put this in a cult classic category. They are on drugs, and not even watching it. The film actually would have been much better, if it was another underground fight movie, without the way overboard trying to be deep and multi faceted art. It is not. The High School chemistry did nothing to help the film. The subliminal message before the credits, was probably aimed at people who spent money to see it. ""You got the shaft"", ""it sucks"", and others which cannot be printed here.",0
"I am mad I had wasted 2 hours of my life seeing this garbage because I read all the high ratings from members. Is everybody crazy to rate this crap over 8??? this is about as stupid as ""12 monkeys"" I bet its the same people who liked that movie, like this one. Brad Pitt made a great movie "" Meet Joe Black"" he made so many other stupid movies ( or inconsequential such as "" The Mexican"") he's a handsome man but other than that can never be Tom Cruise. I don't like Tom Cruise , he's not as nice as Brad but he sure is a great actor.This movie is all about violence, anarchy, annihilation. Why does anybody think blowing up a building, beating the crap out of each other, committing suicide is worth making a movie about .This is very irresponsible of the director, as this is what brought us Columbine, Virginia tech and massive killing, mayhem on a daily basis, how can all this be entertainment?? I think the people liking this movie must be either juveniles, the video game crowds (mindless activity)who never pick up a book, read the newspaper , be pro family or somewhat low IQ to watch this pointless idiotic movie.",0
"Beyond anything I'm about to say, I just don't understand how people can call Fight Club entertaining. I was so bored I had to give myself excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The humor was so juvenile and cliché, I can't say I laughed once?I heard the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as entertainment value goes, I can't see anything redeeming. Every 10 minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new.Being a man, I've heard the cliché ""We're men raised by women!"" so many times I can't even take it seriously anymore. That cliché has existed since then 60's, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now this takes that cliché and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone who is calling this ""daring"" or ""original"" needs to understand something: it takes no more balls the take a cliché and build a movie around it than it does to remake something.The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of ""We're men raised by women!"", so I'm not going to. Go read their reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that: an opinion. I could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way. Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie said so. That's because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alive?but the film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of them would feel just as alive as men?once again, the film doesn't admit that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow cliché that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and original itself, which it's not, the story would at least admit that it is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes, fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to understand?including false reality. Basing an entire view on something based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic.Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if you ignore the fact you've heard every bit of humor on the playground and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively, the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax/finale. Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn't work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling.In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is brilliant. On the other hand, I can't understand anyone out of junior high who shouldn't see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But maybe I'm looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I'm trying to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This just a poor excuse to preach clichés you've heard all your life, not to entertain. It's an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less. If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just downright boring.5/10",0
"Starts off slow, eases into Jack's addiction to support groups, then progresses to meeting Tyler Durden for the first time. They start scrapping in a parking lot regularly because they're bored, attracting the attention of other men who want to fight. A secret society of bare knuckle fighters is formed as a result.Up to this point, I thought the movie was interesting. Jack is a man trying to fill the void in his boring life and realises he's not alone when his fight nights become wildly popular with other men trying to find excitement in their equally hum drum lives.The twist that Jack IS Tyler Durden was almost as bad as revealing it was all a dream. It would have been better keeping Tyler as a REAL man so we could watch how their philosophies clash without the stupid exaggerated conclusion. I'm all for the adsurd and suspending disbelief but watching huge buildings blow up because a man went crazy and turned his underground fighting into a terrorist organisation was ridiculous.",0

"""Fight Club"" is one of those movies where you need to watch it more than once to fully understand what happened in the movie. The problem is that ""Fight Club"" leaves you with no reason to re-watch it other than to know if the movie is actually a complex but brilliant masterpiece, or an overrated film that just barely rises above mediocrity. I guess I will have to stay with believing the latter because nothing makes me want to return.The narrator (Edward Norton), who is suffering from insomnia, meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a company trip. When the narrator returns to his apartment, he finds that it has been destroyed and, with no one else to go to, calls Tyler. The narrator moves into Tyler's house and one night, upon Tyler's request, the narrator punches him. The two begin to fight and attract a crowd of people, which becomes Fight Club. ""Fight Club"" is hailed as a brilliant social commentary about consumerism and how we as people live our lives now, though it isn't saying anything more than any other person or form of media that has spoken up about consumerism, and at the same time is feeding the viewer a false idea. Tyler says, ""An entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy sh*t we don't need."" Right, because there are no other reasons why people would be working these jobs that they hate? Not everything is about consumerism. Some people have jobs for that reason, but others have certain situations in their lives which makes them have to take these white collar jobs even if they hate it. In all fairness, the movie does save itself a bit by disapproving of Tyler's radical plans, but it is still trying to pass off his ideas as an important message when his they are flawed.Carrying on the theme of trying to be brilliant but failing, let's take a look at the plot. So, Tyler is just a figment of the Narrator's imagination because of his insomnia. Okay, got it. So, the Narrator is fighting himself in the parking lot of the bar when a group of guys comes out to watch and decides that they want to fight as well, which means that they were the first people to join fight club. But, they saw that there was obviously something wrong with the Narrator because he's fighting himself, so why would they end up following a guy who was obviously not all there? He wasn't spreading his propaganda about consumerism at the time either, so they weren't following him because they believed his ideas. Then, the twist that Tyler was in the Narrator's head the whole time is one of the laziest twists in cinematic history. Ignoring the fact that it barely makes sense like with the example I gave above, the twist of something being in a character's mind is like a film student level idea when they're trying to be deep. Then, to get rid of Tyler, the Narrator shoots himself in the head and that somehow kills him. I've heard that it's supposed to symbolize that the Narrator was finally able to let go of Tyler and is able to make his own choice now, but to me, symbolism only works if it makes sense. What it's symbolizing makes sense, how it's done doesn't.Along with Pitt and Norton, Helena Bonham Carter (Marla) also appears in the film, who is used for nothing more than additional pointless drama, that makes no sense in the grand scheme of things. It is said throughout the whole movie that the Narrator doesn't like Marla, but the side of him that's Tyler at least tolerates her or has romantic feelings towards her or something. So, at the end, when Project Mayhem is about to go through with its master plan, the Narrator warns Marla to leave town and when she's captured, he goes to help her. Now, it makes a little sense that he might feel guilty about getting her involved, even though he was willing to let her die earlier in the film, but then it implies some sort of deeper connection between them, even though it was the Tyler side of the Narrator that liked her, and it's shown that the Narrator and Tyler both have different ideas and thoughts, so they are individuals, but now the Narrator suddenly cares about Marla.""Fight Club"" is a movie with a flawed understanding of society that, while it's condemning the actions of Tyler Durden, it is promoting his flawed logic as some sort of important message about society and how we live our lives. This movie comes off to me one of those films that actually has very little or nothing new to say, but people believe it has an important commentary to it and praise it even though it's nothing more or less than mediocre and barely worth remembering. I like David Fincher a lot and while, based on what I've seen, I don't believe he's made a bad movie yet, this is cutting is pretty close.",0
"Like so many other users I found this a worthwhile movie to watch for about the first third. The film deals out some hard blows against modern consumer society, that could be called daring for a high budget Hollywood production. The given thesis- relief and the chance to achieve self-discovery through violence, is inane though. As the story develops we see that the whole Fight Club thing leads the protagonists to become some sort of a terrorist organization, culminating in a series of attacks that obviously destroy a good part of the town in the end. Isn't that turning the whole point upside down, so that the message could be: Non conformity will inevitably lead to chaos and destruction, so please avoid any critical thoughts ? In a way I felt that in the end the script-writer attempts to apologizes for the hard strokes dispersed in the beginning.The most embarrassing thing about the movie of course is the displaying of Norton's schizophrenia. You can watch this movie as often as you want: This trick will never work and it will always be an insult to the intelligence of the viewer to realize that the makers really believe they can come up with such nonsense and earnestly hope to get away with it (which they actually did,of course. After all this half-baked botch ranks in the top 30 of all times. That's as incredible as Norton and Pit being the same person ).",0
"FIGHT CLUB stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton as two men who form an underground club where people fight, and the hype catches on with people around the country.  This is an entertaining movie with good leads and acceptable fight scenes, but it's barely passable at best.  The plot is unbelievably dumb, there are a few plot holes and the story fails to make sense at some points.  Pitt and Norton carry the film, but the other characters are one-dimensional and have little or no interest.  The movie is well worth a watch, but it's still a disappointment.2 out of 5",0
"This movie makes the occasional gesture towards Nietszche and being a fight between Reason and the Id - this becomes most apparent closer to the end, when we learn a little something about our main characters. Mostly, however, it is about grown men beating each other into gumbo, because the actual meat of the movie barely touches on that. Essentially, it is a little bit of philosophy wrapped up in a lot of very, very bloody boxing. There's something suspect about the whole matter.It's a rush, sure, but if they wanted to film a WCW match, why did they feel the need to wrap some half-baked quasi-New Age ideas around it? I fear that a bunch of guys around the country will miss the spirit-vs-flesh angle and decide that this fighting thing is Way Cool, Man, and will set up little Fight Clubs in their basements until they all die from internal hemorrhaging. I guess people will buy anything if you wrap fake spirituality around it.",0
"I really enjoyed this movies.... And I hated it as well. The movie was done well and had some great parts, but never came together as a whole. I really think this movie had the same problems that Fincher's last movie (The Game) had.... It lands a huge surprise on you and then forces you to believe it even though it doesn't work at all with the movie. In ""The Game"" it didn't bother me as much because that was more of a ""fun"" film, where as Fight Club actually proports to say something about society. It's worth seeing, but just the ""The Emporer's New Clothes"", this movie proports to be so much, but is really nothing.",0
"The worst movie i've ever seen
How the good actors like brad took some role like this ?
What is that for god sake

"The first 10 minutes made me think this was going to be a great movie, worthy of the high ratings given by those on IMDB. However, I can just barely see it's value as a unique story through the lame dialogue and ridiculous plot. It was too difficult of a film for me to enjoy. I stuck with it but, was thoroughly disapointed mid-way through the film.Good performances but, other than that...certainly no where near my top 250 films.",0
"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested. A  movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it  would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my  friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should  see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last  remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit  rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.  This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and  stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my  eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern  consumer- driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and  Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).  If you are a good man, you need to watch the film. You will find that a  really man to to fighting! We brown in e century, many boys grown as a  girl, you need to watch this film, it will be a true man!",0
"I am 34, I have seen thousands of films, and this is unquestionably the absolute worst. It is evil. Technically well done, but evil still. This film shits on every value I hold dear : honesty, hard work, liberty of thought, non-violence, respect of others as equals, reason as my best tool to make something of my life. It glorifies senseless destruction of property and (which is much, much worse) of able minds in cult-like brainwashing to serve egoistical means. Every problem should be overcome with violence, lies, or blackmail. Every man who is not you is there to be used or beaten into a pathetic degenerate. There is no respect of the other. Also, the ""plot twist"" had me wincing. It was so very obvious from the start that when it happened, I just sighed and shook my head.",0
"Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" this is a film that has such a surprise ending that one almost needs to go back and see this again, from a different perspective. I can't say more without having to provide spoilers.This is a sick movie but I found it interesting in a perverse way. I am sorry so many young people love this movie so much because sordid and sleazy stories should not be so appealing.On the positive side, what I found most interesting was:(1) Pitt's character is totally without God but some of things he says about materialism sound really Biblical in nature. They were fascinating comments. (2) This film is stylishly-shot, a nice movie if you appreciate visuals as I do. (3) Edward Norton's narration was excellent.The characters in here are not clean-cut, high-ideal role models, to say the least. That includes Helena Bonham Carter's role in here. I couldn't take any of these people on the first viewing, but when a profanity filter was invented, I gave this another shot and the rating of the film was elevated from a 3 to a 6.5. Still, even with a filter, this is a bit too sleazy for middle-aged oldies like me. A sad comment that ""nasty"" seems to be so appealing to kids these days.",0
"This has got to be one of the most overrated movies of all-time.Oooh, it was all in his mind. How original. No one has ever thought of that before.Obviously I am being sarcastic.This movie was so boring that I could only get about halfway through it before having to stop, and only later did I get around to watching the second half. That was a mistake. It was as utterly pointless and uninteresting in the second half as it was in the first.This is a classic example of a movie being popular simply because it was trendy for people to say that they liked it.And Brad Pitt? Give me a break. The guy is a hack, only a star because of his looks. He simply can't act.",0
"Okay, so the acting and the overall production was top-drawer, but absolutely nothing can overcome one of the most ridiculous storylines I have ever come across. I put this movie in the same category as David Cronenberg's ""Crash"", in that they both are obsessed with concepts so contrary to basic human nature, that they are totally inane and unbelievable. In ""Crash"", it is absurd to think there are really people who are sexually turned-on by bad car crashes; in ""Fight Club"", it is ridiculous to believe that there are people who enjoy getting pumelled. Thoughts of such concepts leave me so cold as to take away any possibility of enjoying the film.",0
"Fight Club is not a landmark cult-movie, showing a disappointed and frustrated generation. This a too-long, tedious, dull film, just made to forgive it A.S.A.P. Brad Pitt must believe that being a good actor means playing nut, insane, filthy, unshaved people.",0
"It's been a good 15 years since I've seen ""Fight Club"", and it never really did anything for me back then (well there is that ""gotcha!"" ending, but that's about all that stuck in my brain). Now, at 35, it does even less. It's not that I don't ""get"" the movie, but I'm leaving that door open just for argument sake.It's mostly a middle finger to the establishment, gift-wrapped for adolescents. Usually, when a movie's satirizing something, it's engaging, maybe even funny. But by the time Brad Pitt says ""The things you own end up owning you"", it's obnoxious. I got that this is railing against consumerism, desk-jockey angst, ennui, whatever you want to call it (hell, the bursts of '90s CGI drove that point home with a battering ram), but when these people keep yammering on about it, subtlety's a distant memory. You can taste the smugness. It's not a lot of fun, let's put it that way.4/10",0
"I'm as confused as a rat in a maze as to why Fight Club is rated so highly and is in the top 10. The story and the overall film doesn't make much sense, I mean how on Earth does an insomniac office worker have a split personality believing he's talking (and fighting) to someone and starts up a cult following of men that not only do they all appear to enjoy fighting without moral question but are completely brainwashed and have become terrorists to his cause? Not only that but the main character breaks the fourth wall. I just find this film to be incredibly weird, also I don't understand why Marla just can't give a straight answer of things that are happening between them which the main character doesn't realise he's doing. But the weirdest thing about this film is when he's fighting with Tyler Durden, there's a part where he's being dragged and it's seen from a security camera which shows it's just him dragging himself, but how is this possible? He looks like he's being dragged by a ghost.Personally, I didn't like this film and from what I think from a general consensus, no way is this a masterpiece, maybe the revealing of the split personality thing but everything else is just weird.",0
"After all the discrete, awful, painful, sequences with too much blood and gore, and real buzz-kill sheet scenes where Brad Pitt, wearing boxing gloves, or surgical gloves, humping the washed-up chain-smoker. I thought there must be something more than a deus ex machina in the end, something thrilling and enlightening that somehow makes the movie worthy of the suffering.But no. Brace yourself for the catastrophic collapses near the end, it's basically the routine deus ex machina that explains everything by startling the protagonist out of reverie, things went awry when the narrator and Brad Pitt merged into one, a most implausible schizophrenic, who contradicts almost the whole plot line before this ham-fisted twist. Then this eerie double personality talked directly to the audience from David Fincher's perspective -- now it's a holy trinity of them -- ""It's called a changeover, the movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea.""I'd have hurled myself at the screen if I had been old enough to go and see and understand it in a cinema.Besides, I have little idea what the novel by Chuck Palahniuk is about, I tried to give it a whirl but it kinda strengthened my belief that stream of consciousness should be solidified before written down, the ill-punctuated text rendered me brain damaged.",0
"So, there was once a loser, a guy who is so depressed and alienated by society and his job that he has to join different self-help groups, even though he does not suffer from the conditions of the attendants, just to find some human warmth. Suddenly an unfortunate incident leaves him homeless, and he turns to a recently met friend for help. This means a dramatic change in his life, his friend is handsome, strong, full of self-confidence, charismatic, bold, audacious, that is, just the opposite from him, and the one he would maybe like to become. And his friend opens for him a sort of liberation path, through fight!, the most basic and primitive of human instincts; first between them, then starting a club of fighters who meet every week to release their life frustrations through violence and direct hand-to-hand combat. The other most primitive human instinct, sex, appears abruptly too, but it's not him, but his friend whom becomes the sex partner of the girl he likes. Most of the film time is spent in the development of the fight club, which gets bigger, with some of its members going to live to the friend house (much to the displeasure of the protagonist), and then finally turning into a sort of protest/sabotage/terrorist group.And suddenly his friend disappears, and in his search for him the protagonist discovers that his friend founded many other fight clubs in other cities. And here the ""great"" moment of the film comes!... the protagonist discovers that his friend is actually... himself!!, it is a fictional personage created by his own mind, the person he would like to be, the embodiment of his ambitions, of everything he admires... and hates all at once, the fictional being through whom he takes revenge on the senseless world he lives in. And thus we are forced to completely change our perspective and interpret the whole story under a totally new point of view, and it is just then when we realize the story we have been told is about.... NOTHING AT ALL!!!.... liberation through violence and sex?? oh yeah! we might believe that if the end of the film showed us something different from a guy meekly pleading his lady to come back with him, something different form a guy horrified at the tragical consequences the acts of violence he has promoted have had. Regret from having departed so much from the established social order?? it just does not make sense.Then we start to think of the internal coherence of the story, and we find so many plot holes and so much inconsistency that the whole film literally deflates into nothing but a bunch of senseless violent scenes and a ridiculously pretentious and void criticism-against-the-system message.Probably one of the most overrated films at IMDb, a perfect example of a film which should have never been made.",0
"I think the movie is worth 2 or 3 at most.What the whole movie really brought to the viewers is a mass of violence, destruction, illogic, impossibility and obscurity.I am not going to describe the violence and destruction here because everyone can easily understand what I am talking about. These things are obvious. I want to point out the latter three.First, if a person don't know how to create explosives, how come after becoming a psycho he/she can? ...illogical and impossible. Second, without Brad Pitt, how could a fight club exist? ...illogical. Third, what did the other members of the fight club do to earn a living? They appeared as jobless or tramps. ...impossible and obscure. Actually there are other points I am tired of pointing out.If all these things are good in our world, what is the bad? As a result, it was not awarded any prize.",0
"This heavily hyped film is first rate trash. I'm surprised I had the patience to watch it for an hour.I cannot recall another film quite this boring. However, if you think you can derive pleasure from watching young men beat one another up for no other reason than they like to beat one another up, this film is for you.For me, it was a waste of time!",0
"This one is sick. I had hoped and prayed I would not live to see another film as bad as the Matrix but Fight Club is. In a way it is even worse since it is not as obviously silly. The actors can really play the directing is as good as could be expected by someone like Fincher (I loved Se7en). So what is wrong? Well, it is sick. Now, that is not a smart thing to say when criticising  a film but there is no way to avoid it. Fight Club is extremely violent. This is something I do not like in general but for a movie with a title like Fight Club to be expected. And it is not senseless violence like in Matrix but belonging to the story. Indeed it is the essence and in this sense acceptable. What is wrong, if not evil, is that it is presented as a possible solution to the emptiness we feel in our lives. So our generation did not enjoy the blessing of an honest good war? No wonder we degenerate and start buying IKEA furniture. Is this a joke? It is not meant as one.
Our hero (the `Narrator') cannot sleep. He is not really happy but who is. What to do? First he finds some unusual hobby. He goes to meetings of people who really suffer.  And the mixture of real feelings mixed with the ridiculous situation gives him energy some fake `sense of life'. There he meets the beautiful Marla. My heart jumped with joy. There was some kindred spirit. They should fall in love, marry, settle down, have some kids live happily (more or less) ever after. That is what I want (I know I am the one who is sick but this is what watching classic Hollywood movies did to me.) It would have been perfect. Unfortunately the film would have been over after fifteen minutes. That is why our hero first has to go to point zero. And he does it by establishing this Fight Club and moving in with lovely Brad. Okay, why not. But does it have to be terror organisation next? Come on. What is the point of the whole thing? You enjoyed the film? Punch yourself on the nose and start thinking. Or even better stop pretending that you do. The schizophrenia angle was rather foreseeable but the happy ending was okay. Like I said... the two hours in between where at best annoying at worst... (I will think of something.)",0
"Words like over-rated and pseudo-intellectual come to mind when I look back on this film. Its overblown philosophising was lost on me long before it ended and I was not in the least surprised that its highest popularity in the IMDB ratings comes from males aged under 18. This demographic is of course renowned for its ability to look deeply into and appreciate the philosophical content of movies. This film seems to have developed a cult following but not, I suspect, for reasons its director intended.",0
"Sorry but I thought this movie was so hyped up for nothing... I thought it stinked... Maybe it doesn't deserve the 1 I gave it, but I am not pleased with the high rating it has. Definetly not in the top 100 movies of all time!!! Are you mad?",0
"Here's the moral of this film:  The way to self-realization is through utter self-debasement, delusion and the destruction of  achievement.This film seeks to undermine all the merits of mankind, while embracing decay and destruction.  This ugly message is portrayed as something noble, and it's sickening to me that an imaginative plot twist at the end is enough to fool the public into thinking this film was 'entertaining'.  Instead, it is amoral, anti-life, and perhaps the worst excuse for art or entertainment I've ever seen.",0
"Chuck Pallanick is a real piece of worst writing ever existing on this planet. This is one fact, admit it. The Fight Club flick is a real decent screening of his terribly writing on to a silver screen. This is The worst film of all time in all instances, in all possible scenarios. Point. No arguing here. Nothing, simply nothing in this unimaginable horrific piece of manure gives any redeeming feature or any clue. Dirt, mud, muck, slime, blood, vapid acting, hollowness, emptiness, nihilism and a total waste of 120 minutes. Just. Terrible. It is so. Edward Norton gives a weak delivery, Brad Pitt does not help, too, and Helena Bonham Carter is simply awful. This is the key-word - awful. The whole Fincher's flick is just awful mess.

"That could possibly describe what this movie is. Awful! I know most of you will disagree with me but sorry it sucked. First off there is no acting in this movie. You could put any actors in place of Brad and Edward and it would be the same. But in my opinion neither of them should never win an Oscar anyway for any of their works. Second, what was going on? I mean I get the story of Edward trying to be someone else and all but it was told well at all. It was a very dark movie. Saying this is the best movie of all time makes me laugh. There is no way it can be. If you want to argue about this let me know. Fight Club = F",0
Having just finished viewing Fight Club on video my opinion is it was awful! However I noticed I was in the vast minority of others who voted. Just goes to show how opinions can vary. I did like the cast and felt the three lead characters were very good but their talents were wasted. If you took out the popularity and charisma of Pitt and Norton and replaced them with lesser known actors the video would hardly be worth watching!,0
"i have read many reviews for this movie and most of them used words like unique, excellent and life changing. i have just one question how? the acting by both the leads was good, i got to admit that, but haven't people heard of something called a script. the movie was just a collection of pathetic scenes each one leaving you more confused and bored then u were before. well for direction, there wasn't any. all in all i have to say i have seen my share of bad movie, this one is a strong contender for the top spot. its a shame talent like brad Pitt considered doing such a mindless, senseless, scriptless and tasteless movie, which even the brilliant acting by the male leads couldn't save. the one point is purely for the acting.",0
"After watching Fight Club, and before writing this comment here I have watched it 6 times myself alone to find out why it got so many ratings and votes from the audiences. Just after 2000 I had watched lots and numerous movies existing in the world, but so far no single comments are available here in this IMDb. Now I am in bound to express my personal feelings about this unnecessarily overrated movie. I find nothing special in this dumb and irritating Fight Club starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Why did this movie got good stars and many comments? Just because others are dancing and so they too blindly dancing with them after getting into the story of Tyler Durden?David Fincher - I think David is good at making movies based on mental sickness, human illusion and social understanding. He could have used the actors in better perspective to make the whole story clearer than it is. Fight Club - This movie was actually flopped when it released theatrically worldwide. So can we really consider it as a hit or blockbuster? No doubt, it got momentum when it later came out in DVD. I was mostly displeased with the twisting climax, which has nothing special to thrill the human mind. It is just simple to predict in some points of the story. There are some scenes which make bored and eagerly wait to move forward in the next scenes. This is not a case with good thrillers like The Bourne trilogy series, The Peacemaker, Collateral Jeepers Creepers, The Recruit, Paycheck, The Shooter, The Departed or say Impostor . For my 8 years of continuously watching different types of movies and analysing the choices of the audiences, I came to confusion why audiences really admired this movie! Well, it might have became a cult-film for creating the ideas of building 'fight club's but this movie actually has a negative and improper purposes. The twisted ending seems to be much dissatisfying in catching the truth. But in fact, the movie has no concern with the world's reality.Brad Pitt - I wonder why Brad Pitt accepted the role as an illusionary Tyler Durden who rule the narrator's way of living. Surprisingly he turned out as non-existing person who appears from schizophrenic narrator Jack (Norton). I like Pitt a lot his role in Kalifornia and Se7ven and Mr & Mrs Smith, but not here.Edward Norton - I was really impressed by his role in only 2 hits - Rounders and The Italian Job. But this time also he won my heart for his innocence and ignorant role as Jack. He did his role as demanded by the script and the director or the producers. He was a right choice for this role better than others.Helena Bonham Carter - She does not have the necessary looks to become a star or celebrity, but by chance she got good remarks for her role here. No impressions exist from her role as Marla Singer but only to look once.",0
"If you're looking to waste an evening with over-indulgent tripe then this just might be the film for you. David Fincher has made an entire career out of making films that cater to the lowest common denominator and the basest of instincts and with ""Fight Club"" he outdoes himself. What's worse than Fincher's ham-fisted direction is the performance of the non-actors Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Everything they do tends to either be over-the-top bad or so very unforgettable as to almost be non-existent. From uninspiring frame one to the ""thank God it's over"" final frame this pictures drags itself around on it's half baked premise like the last steps of someone on their last breath of life. Save yourself the time and seek out something far more substantial than this.",0
"I have not seen a movie so dumb like this in my life. I mean seriously what the director thinks that viewers are? I wasted 2 hours watching this. Ultimate boredom, silly, no script, no story.",0
"Fight Club, by David Fincher, is the story of a man who comes to grip with the daily monotony that is his everyday life, by starting a club in which friends beat each other senselessly in hopes of having a good time.  This movie had all the right ingredients to be a great film.  With the help of superlative performances and brilliant photography, Fight Club is quite a picture.  However, the dark aspects of the film and preposterous climax make it hard for one to watch without cringing or laughing in the wrong spots. Fight Club takes many turns that are completely nonsensical in hopes of making a political statement about United States economic culture. Nevertheless it is hard for one to listen to statements such as these without questioning where the money came from to make such a film.  Fight Club is defiantly an inventive film but in the end like the Portland Trailblazers, it just doesn't `click.'",0
"It is a very entertaining film, with all the violence and actions.  The plot is somewhat intriguing as well.  However, I just felt that the film tries too hard to deal with the topic of ""the Unconscious,"" and the other half of self.  Yet, it falls very short of developing it as a themem.  In the end, other than chewing on some popcorns, I got nothing out of that movie.",0

"Well, you need to cover the anger-market, so you do a supossedly Politically Incorrect movie full of empty and flashy FX with a lot of unnecesary violence and an ilogical twist at the end and walla!!, you have all that young people (and I'm 25) that wants to feel intelligent in your hand. Fincher has done this before, in the fascist ""Seven"".  ""Memento"" is not fascist, and is more intelligent, but uses the same trick.  Ok, people, c'mon, we can do better than this.  Do you liked the intelligent subtetly of ""Sixth Sense"" and/or ""Unbreakable""? (the real minority movies that only a bunch of people liked because they asked for your brain).  Do you watch non-USA films? (I don't think so, and I'm NOT speaking about the Hollywood Foreign Film fodder for americans like ""Life is Beautiful"").  I'm tired of posting negative anti-comments reviews, but unfortunately there is only one IMDB, and I'm trying to do a little bit of film education here.  I promisse to write about the movies that I like (the ones that generally have only five comments -or none- in their page).",0
"This film is the one of the worst uses of celluloid I've seen. No plot, acting by Ed Norton, Brad (I can't act) Pitt, and others off the mark.  It's just plain lame.  It's herky jerky...the NEW way to make films...just film a series of crazy mixed up scenes and teenagers dig it.  This can only be described as a ""teenagers angst"" film...society's out to get me so form a fight club to strike back.  Forget this film...unless you're 16 and feeling bad.",0
"It's very impressive visually, nicely directed, well acted, scripted in a literate way, and immeasurably depressing.I suppose the plot has been covered in detail elsewhere so I'll keep it brief. The narrator (Edward Norton)is a bored, anomic insomniac who doesn't know why he's alive. He runs into a creepy and insulting babe (Helena Bonham Carter) who seems to care about nothing. Then he meets a brutally honest Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who seems to see through everything and everyone, who actively hates and engages in combat against modern ennui and phoniness, and things start to pop. Pitt and the narrator found Fight Club in which men who would otherwise be leading lives of quiet desperation get to pound the crap out of one another. Fight Club franchises spring up everywhere as men search for their lost cojones. Pitt becomes a cult leader and wages war against corporate art with homemade explosives. The upshot of all this, I won't reveal.I didn't like it at all. At first I thought it was going to turn into one of those Gallic philosophical conundrums with a lot of pointless non sequiturs in the foreground. (Narrator: Is Tyler Durden in my dream? Or am I in his?"") Then it appeared to morph into an excuse for more bloodshed and violence. And then it got really twisted. I never realized a guy could shoot off a large-caliber pistol in his mouth and carry on a normal conversation five minutes later.It will, I suppose, be claimed that this is an original -- in contrast to the formulaic rubbish ground out by Hollywood these days. True enough, but it's not all THAT original. Proving your masculinity by enduring punishment? Is there a Rambo movie in which Stallone doesn't bleed, or get himself dipped in pig excrement, or electrocuted half to death, without flinching? In the stockade, in James Jones' ""From Here to Eternity,"" the guards treat the inmates with unspeakable brutality. So what do the prisoners do to prove their transcendance of authority? They beat hell out of each other, in games, in ways that the guards wouldn't have the imagination to dream up. Not to mention a hundred movies about The Big House and POWs and slaves biting their tongues during whippings.The punishment within the group is only part of the story, of course. It leads to a consideration of secret cults and their desire to rid the world of credit cards. We've had that before too, with Charlie Manson and the Reverend Jim Jones. And if Tyler Durden is going to insult the narrator by calling him ""Ikea Boy"", and if the group is going to assault society by demolishing icons like Starbucks, don't they have some kind of obligation to provide more constructive icons? Shouldn't they have some sense of beauty, truth, and logic that takes them beyond moral nihilism? Or is the movie actually saying that Western civilization SHOULD be destroyed? The film is ugly to watch, partly because the message itself is so banal, and partly because the imagery is so repulsive. The back of somebody's head is blown off. Human fat is boiled down to make soap. Fight Club members lives in an abandoned house near a toxic waste dump amid unutterable squalor. They don't seem to change clothes. (The narrator shows up for work at his office with his own blood on his shirt.) They don't bathe. Brad Pitt shuffles around in a filthy bathrobe wearing a pair of lady's slippers with clotted fur around the tops, as Doris Day might appear during a trip on battery acid. It isn't that I find such voluntarism necessarily bad. I'm sitting here writing this, wearing only a sarong and a pair of eyeglasses in the middle of the desert. But doesn't bodily filth reach a point at which it becomes intolerable to the self, never mind the person you're trying to sell your homemade soap to? Mostly, though, what a beastly message. If you want to swagger around, a member of a cult, dealing out summary punishment to those whose values aren't your own, why not join Blackwater or some other mercenary group and at least get paid more than one thousand dollars a day. Or if you really want to get in your face with respect to bourgeois verities, give away everything you have and serve soup to the homeless at St. Anthony's Dining Room. Or vote Libertarian? Or become a Theravada Buddhist monk, earning merit and living on alms? I guess, though, that nothing like that is going to get your testosterone pumping and that's what concerns this movie. Know when blood testosterone levels peak in men? During late adolescence, when our fantasies are even more limited than our brain power.",0
I can't believe how many people actually like this film....... I can't believe how looooooonnnnngggggg and boooooooooring it was. It was the strangest and weirdest film I'd ever seen. Everything that happened in this film would never happen in real life ever. Even the ending was the worse ending to a film. I'm speaking from a girls point of view tho ... Girls it is rubbbbbishhhh. It's more of a mans wishful way of thinking. This film I'd say was probably brad Pitts worse films he has done. A good film he was in was SNATCH. I'd recommend that film over this anyday. A film this long should be capturvating . I was waiting for it to get better then the ending come and I thought I can't believe I just sat here and watched it. Very strange very weird and would never happen !!,0
"The first 10 minutes made me think this was going to be a great movie, worthy of the high ratings given by those on IMDB. However, I can just barely see it's value as a unique story through the lame dialogue and ridiculous plot. It was too difficult of a film for me to enjoy. I stuck with it but, was thoroughly disappointed mid-way through the film.Good performances but, other than that...certainly no where near my top 250 films.",0
Took the time out of my day to leave some feedback. I should have walked out of this movie in the first 10 minutes. THE WORST i've ever seen. 2 hours of my life i will never get back.,0
"Another of David Fincher's tiresome gay fantasies involving rough trade with shaved heads, and one pathetic female outsider. (Think Alien^3.)  Lots of muscles, sweat, grime, adrogyny, faux-noir scenes.  Hey, David -- been there, done that, still bored to death by it.You know, actually, it was on its way to becoming a nice, different kind of thriller, but the writers apparently ran out of ideas and turned it into a groaner.  I literally groaned and shook my head, and stayed only to see how it ended.",0
"the movie started very well, in a very original way, but the very moment the girl made her entrance into the movie, I understood that I fell into a trap: her appearance as a mix of Patsy Kensit and Beetlejuice, which should represent some sort of troubled woman - troubled by an unclear kind of trouble she seems to have - is where the movie immediately starts to turn into a boring repetition of a ""look, this man was living a senseless life and will find his real nature by beating the hell out of people"".in general, the whole movie seems to travel on a path between ""troubled people are cool"" and ""oh, look at the poor middle class worker turning into a cool beating machine"".then, a couple of stupid plot twists, and some hundreds of scenes which require an abundant dose of suspension of disbelief, turn the movie into what seems to be the movie reduction of some comics for troubled teenagers (and pardon my ignorance if it actually is, but I'm not and never been into such kind of comics).I'm 39, and I have watched the movie on year 2016, so I have probably missed the right time to watch it on target (I believe the target is about 30 years old), but I don't really think I could have personally enjoyed the movie at any age.i understand the movie is trying to tell you something beyond what you actually see: yes, I have the minimum IQ required to understand this (which is about 60, I believe); it's just that the ""wake up and make your dreams real"" motto which is behind the movie just doesn't catch me, especially if it is told for 130 minutes *AND* in a stupid way.yes, this movie seems to fascinate lots of people, while harassing a strict minority; I'm clearly part of the second area. I'm not giving 1/10 to this movie like many others, as it would be unfair, but honestly I can't give it more than 4.my hint is: if when you see the girl coming into the screen your bad-movie-sense tickles you, then do yourself a favour and turn the thing off",0
"This is one of those movies that anyone I speak to loves. It is this fact that urged me to actually give it a try a couple of years ago and I got halfway through (roughly) and gave up. Last week though I gave it a second shot, and watched it in it's entirety this time around. What I saw wasn't bad but I found myself curious why this movie gets so much praise.The performances were good, although I think Ed Norton was somewhat incoherent at times of narration. I have no problem with the acting shown here, and I also think as a piece of cinema it is well shot, with good direction. This isn't an entirely negative review.I must, however, stop the praise here. I think this movie gets more praise than it deserves, and honestly I think it may be in-part down to the cast. Ed Norton was endearing himself to a lot of people at this time and Brad Pitt has always been a massive name, and is an excellent actor.Where this movie falls down for me is, it doesn't seem to go anywhere. The story is shown in such a way that I felt like it was merely an excuse to show violence at times. Sure, anyone watching a movie called Fight Club surely can't be shocked at some violence, but I saw it as essential to the driving of the movie rather than the additional section I feel it was meant to be.I also didn't feel like the movie went anywhere in particular. I know it has a plot and it comes to a conclusion, but it never felt like I cared about the ending, a 'twist' that was pretty obvious from early on in the movie, at least for me.I'm not completely slating this movie, as stated above, it has it's merits. Just not one for me, and I hope i'm not completely alone in thinking this way.5 out of 10",0
"I read that Fight Club is a ""man's film"", whatever that means. Truth be told, it's a little boy's film, a messy; scrappy; clawing; pseudo-philosophical piece of turgid nonsense lapped up by people who see a music video aesthetic crossed with their favourite actors churned out of this contemporary Hollywood star system we have that just happens to dabble in some meek philosophy: bums and nobodies like the ones in the film will find its gimmicky pretences enthralling, appealing and quite interesting. For the rest of us, this is lecturing nonsense from a writer whom ought to have all his pens, pencils and word processors taken away from him. The film's entire thesis is captured in a sequence in which, at the fight club of the title, the store owner comes down into his own shop's basement to question what everyone's doing. After some grief from Durden, he beats him before eventually being subdued himself by a blood soaked Durden slobbering all over him. The owner runs off; suddenly attuned to allowing the club to remain and all he needed to arrive at this point is a good fight of some description. That's it; that's all you need to know right there _ the rest is nonsense of the highest order.The film plays out under this facade of post-modern trickery and modern movie making gimmicks, thus rendering it ""accessible""; but the fact we're expected to swallow this infantile babble about how difficult it is to be a blank, bummed out nobody; a thug, a vandal, whose lives are in the dank state they are because they never found any particular field in which they could excel, is pathetic. The film was David Fincher's fourth, but he will not churn out a worser piece of cinematic drek in his life than the adolescent, preening nonsense that is Fight Club. The piece is essentially one long flashback and is narrated by Edward Norton's nameless character. When we first see him, he has a gun in his mouth and finds himself in an area chock full of explosives courtesy of Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Norton initially I.D's himself as a slave to consumerism; an unexciting office worker who comes to find solace in fighting and violence with other men in an organised fight ring from whence the title derives. But in Durden, a frightening character is created: a thug, a vandal, a terrorist but a role model; an individual whose manic hair style; cool looking shades; extravagant dress sense; sexual habits and natural charisma paints positive characteristics in an individual that ought to be anything but. Durden sees himself as a saviour; a liberator; an army general whom leads his troops and encourages them to break the shackles of life; someone whom frees and liberates via terror, as exemplified in a scene set in a convenience store car park in which he threatens to execute a young store worker if he doesn't return to education. All this leads to a sickening finale, an end that carries a highly romanticised, emotionally heavy sensibility about it as bombs go off and two people embrace.The film is from the pen of Jim Uhls by way of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the film is Palahniuk's inane babbling against the machine; his banal, inane ranting and raving of which the arguments in the film are put across by way of nothing more than childish expositional tidbits on behalf of Pitt's character: ""The things you own end up owning you"" is a sample. In stark comparison to Norton's grey suit; blank shirt-clad and office booth based character, the one he shares most screen time with, Durden is a dangerously vibrant explosion of colour and energy. Later, there's a reason for all this hopping about in characteristics and mannerism as well as the restrictions in the Norton-Pitt interaction; but in itself, opens up a number of problems as to how they can be in separate places at once and how on Earth one person can know about one item (such as the whereabouts of the human fat) with the other seemingly oblivious to all links to it.Make no mistake, the film is the clawing ramblings of someone with some serious issues. In attempting to wage a war on consumerism, we get plenty in the way of product placement for companies such as Pepsi and Apple Macintosh; its approach sees a world initially filtered through the psyche of an insomniac in Norton's character, before support groups and false emotion helps cure that and a character named Marla (Carter) push it back to the forefront again. Is there a need for her character? Marla's presence opens up a sub-plot to do with her own problems of suicidal ideation and a fling she has with Durden which is entirely pointless. After a while, the film realises her presence is futile; that the piece is meant to be about the relationship of its two lead men, their masculinity and their relationship with other men, scrapping her for more inane tangents that run off on separate strands.The whole thing is as empty headed and crass as it sounds, this underground fight ring escalating from a celebration of pain, violence and all things grimy and nasty into a tale of a terrorist group full of 'misunderstood' philistine-infused males. In creating an ugly film about ugly people with ugly views, but filtering it by way of sporadic philosophy and sociology with an accessible aesthetic in its MTV-style appearance, Fincher has crafted a text he's most certainly above. It's nonsense of the worst kind; the sort of nonsense that has an eye on being labelled as something higher than first appears, addressing people in society doing what's deemed menial jobs before actually becoming someone in the ring during which battering and bruising someone else is the answer to life's problems. It's babble; babble of the most patronising and disorganised, sporadic order; a maddening and dulling faux-intellectual piece of nonsense.",0
"Take away Pitt's perfect physique... This film enables the viewer to submerge into an ocean of cynicism and desperation. If you find it irresistibly trendy to let go of any hope or optimism, preferring to celebrate disappointment with the no-show ""perfect world"" some idiot parent promised you, and wallow in self-pity presented with a facade of fashionable violence, then this film is for you. Knock yourself out. I'd stop now if IMDb didn't require a longer review... Production quality, acting, editing, etc. for this film is all first-rate Hollywood. First-rate Hollywood...now that's a good thing, right? Hope you enjoyed this alternative to all the wondrous reviews ""Baseball Bat""...I mean ""Fight Club"" has received.",0
"I can't say if the ending of this film is good or bad, because I've got fed up with it well before the end.David Fincher seems to have a taste for grotesque excess. This can be seen in the Madonna videos he directed; it was plain for all to see in ""Se7en"" (a horrible film) and it is evident again in this film as well.This film is disturbing to watch, but, unlike ""Se7en"", at least it's not revolting. It will be liked by all those who think that, in order to criticise the distorted way in which we live, it's essential that an amount of violence as high as possible be shown and represented graphically, even though it doesn't really add to the story. It's not just the violence: it's the whole film that is unpleasant to watch, for no plausible reason.This is not being original, or visionary, or artistic, or intelligent, thought-provoking, innovative. If you met someone on the street and he punched in the stomach for no apparent reason, how many of you would you say that his action is ""thought-provoking""? Not many, I suppose. This film is the cinematic equivalent of a punch in the stomach by a stranger, but it's a little less subtle.Moreover, this film is also boring, very boring.I'm rather tired of directors that seem to indulge in shocking the public with unrealistic plots and hyperrealistic violence. Clearly, some of those directors have realised that they can play that game and get away with it (plus a lot of critical acclaim and, probably, a good deal of money). Personally, I think that this film is basically nonsensical. I suspect that, as with ""Se7en"", it succeeds in making some people feel trendy because they can stand industrial amounts of imaginative violence. Transgression is the word.Sometimes it's even ludicrous. In the sequence in which Brad Pitt gets beaten by the landlord, after the second punch his face bleeds, but after the third one the blood has disappeared. Miraculous, indeed.",0
"After reading and hearing so many good things about this movie, Iexpected something slick and well written at least. What I saw wasa loose, sloppy, romanticised portrait of a sociopathicschitzophrenic. The overall silliness of the first five minutes is anindicator that this is not a movie to take too seriously, which is fineif this were any kind of comedy-but it just isn't. It isn't campy, and itisn't funny in any parts. The potential for this film was much higherthan it turned out, especially with all the great talent of so many ofthe actors, and having such a unique idea for the main plot. BradPitt was excellent, as were so many of the supporting actors.Norton was not, but he had an impossible task doing somethingthe screenwriter and director wanted, but which was to be almostnot human at all. He was forced to be both very inhuman andinhumane. If someone is really inhuman, it is difficult for the viewerto empathize unless they have the same tendency of beingsociopathic. An inhumane sociopath is a fascinating film subject,but not if they are robotic. Yes, I'm over 45, but I enjoy many kinds of youthful films, or can atleast see why they are liked. I enjoy a wide variety of artistic,abstract, and strange films, as well as mainstream blockbusters. Ibase my opinion on overall excellence, not on technicalachievement. Actually a movie this bad, but at the same timeinnovative, would have benefitted from being made more lowbudget, without all the expensive scenery, props and specialeffects. Then it might have focused more on humans and havebetter insight into the main character's condition and mind, insteadof being merely hinted at, glossed over, and romanticized. All thegood and bad things that can justifiably be said about this film, themost truthful one that stands out the most is that it is just rawstupidity. I realize it is a fantasy story. But that a wimp like Nortoncould convince a horde of millions (all men-no women by the way,since women in the whole world are apparatently only inanimatesex objects) to convert to some sorry cult with no causes otherthan anarchism and individual brutality, is beyond stupidity. This film does have good technical qualities and some greatacting; and it does have content. Some special effects movieshave no real content or human interaction. This does have somegood content, but it is heavily diluted with bad story writing and toomuch emphasis on a selfish, unknowable character.",0
"Hi! My name is average movie watcher! I think David fincher is cool because his movies have quirky dialogue and the camera moves EVERYWHERE!Wow! This guy is different! He speaks on my level! He represents my restless teenagerery!But can he capture emotions?Can his camera zoom all the way through a house, down the block, under traffic and straight to our hearts?No. He blows.This movie is the most over-rated piece of MTV generation garbage I have ever seen. I have given it a chance by watching it four times, and it got worse each time.I have heard people talking about how it, ""made them re-think their lives and how they view the world,"". I'm sorry guys, but this movie doesn't make me think about anything but NOT SEEING IT AGAIN!Please, find yourselfs a better movie to ""change your lives"". I would suggest Spielberg's masterpiece ""A.I."", or if you're a Ed Norton fan, watch ""American History X,"" or if you can handle some reading, and I hope you can, why don't you rent ""Life is Beautiful?""Now, I am not trying to say ""Fight Club"" is a terrible movie, it does have it's good aspects, but please, its not revoloutionary in any way and it won't change your life.Thank you. Please, feel free to e-mail me. I would love to hear your comments.Thanks and take care,Tim",0
"As a main character says ""This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.""  That's how I felt for most of this film which essentially steals its premise from the 1987 film ""Angel Heart"".  The performances of the lead actors all top notch, but the execution of the story is almost painful to watch.  Sure, there's plenty of commentary on our current socio/economic state, but does that necessarily make it insightful or brilliant? If lots of bare knuckle fighting and bleeding really pops your cork, then this is the film for you.  But if you're looking for a strong story with a real hero, such as in the first 2 Rocky movies or Van Damme's Bloodsport then keep on looking.",0
"I saw ""Fight Club"", and, mostly, I was bored.  The amazing thing about the movie isn't the movie itself but how the vast majority of people who see it -- especially men 16-40 -- see it through machismo-colored glasses and never really 'see' it.""Fight Club"" is not about consumerism or evil corporations or even about fighting.  It's about the dangers of homophobia, plain and simple, about being deep in the closet and being angry about it.As such, it's a hit-and-miss film, with good moments and bad.  One of its major drawbacks is a wildly inconsistent tone, a common problem with satire. But let's look at what so many viewers somehow miss.Start with the trail of bread crumbs that begins with Tyler Durden dressing like he shops for clothes in Ru Paul's trash.  Watch Jack hug a man with enormous breasts and no testicles and hear him say how it's oddly comforting.  Watch him and Tyler 'share' a woman who is, in fact, more masculine than either of them.Watch dozens of men join a secret, no-girls club (an underground social movement) in which they can't keep their shirts on or their hands off of each other.  Watch as this club turns into an adoring cult.  Watch as they scorn women -- especially women who use liposuction to 'artificially' try to be sexy and appealing to men.  Listen to all the dialogue complaining about emasculation, about how the world won't let you just be a man.Yes, very subtle.  The 'twist' at the end is like an exclamation point, and the falling phallic towers, and the gun-fellatio, and the unending symbolism of self-love / self-hate are a tad over the top.Why do these men fight each other?  Because they're too deep in the closet to express their feelings any other way.  Why do so many men who see this movie miss this searchlight glaring in their eyes?  You be the judge.The movie is clearly intentionally surreal, so why anyone would take it at face value is beyond me.  The fighting -- contrary to what many people absurdly claim -- is desperately unrealistic, no more realistic than the fighting in a typical 1970's kung fu film and less interesting to watch.  No one who's seen or been in a real fight -- that they were sober enough to remember clearly -- could say that the fighting in the movie is realistic. 
Nothing in the movie is realistic past the point where Jack meets Durden. The story is the fever-dream of a deeply conflicted man.  It's not even subtle about it.  The first act of the movie -- pre-Durden -- is all right, and pretty original, but once Durden shows up the film spirals down into drawn-out repetition and heavy-handed symbolism, becoming more and more hyperbolic and tiresome.I mean, OK, OK -- homophobia and repression are bad.  But the movie doesn't have much of a point if the audience leaves the theater without a clue.",0
"Why does everyone overrate Fight Club as IF it was a masterpiece?Why is Fight Club considered one of the all-time best? I don't know! Maybe this is me. I don't feel very attracted to movies with many violence, maybe I don't like to be confronted with the dark side of society nowadays (probably not the dark side, but 75% of society. I'm sorry, maybe, I didn't express myself well enough. I watched and enjoyed many movies with violence, but my  point is I don't like  (I'm sorry again) movies depicting very much misery. I believe that Fight Club couldn't have been shown otherwise. Anyway, I told you already that I didn't enjoy many with this odd picture, but as your mind and costumes may be somehow different, you may enjoy it and since this is made out of opinions you may rate this almost piece of crap however you want, but I can't give anymore than 4/10.",0
"What. Was. This? This was stupid...what was going on? I am going to warn you right now that if, like me, you were hoping to learn about soap by watching this movie you will be sorely disappointed. Their house was totally dirty and had bad electricity. There was one point in this movie when I sat on the remote and accidentally changed the channel to ""the real housewives of new jersey"" and I didn't even notice! It's basically the same premise. Somebody is in front of the camera doing something, and somebody else is all ""oh, no, uhhhh, you can't do that...here"". I'm sorry if you liked this movie but it means that you're stupid. Why are you so stupid? Stop it.",0
"I voted this movie be 1/10 stars on this website, which is way to much for a movie like this. I didn't like the atmosphere in the film at all. Beating each other without any reasonable reason. Besides that there were lots of blasphemic things in this movie in combination with very violent language.I think filmmakers show that they are incompetent by using a script that contains lots of violent words. Why... would you might think right now. Almost all real good movies like Gladator, The Green Mile, Lord of the Rings and The Shawshank Redemption show us that you create atmosphere by good acting and story telling...therefore you don't need actors to use blasphemic language all the time.This movie was bought by a friend of mine and we watched it at his home. We both got so sick and tired to watch this crap that he opened the DVD player even before the movie actually ended and broke the DVD. We went smoking outdoors...but my evening was truly spended on a movie worthless to see.",0
"Fight Club hooks you fast, and has a lot going for it.  Fincher does a great job directing, and Pitt and Norton are great as well.  Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes, with it's clever little twist, totally ruined it for me. I think that the basic ideas behind the book got lost in the translation (to a certain extent, but not completely).",0
"This movie is very very very (times 10 to the 100th power) bad. I mean come on. Brad Pit and Edward Norton in a fight! I'd rather watch a pokemon fight then those two weak fruity actors fight (but Brad was OK in Ocean 11 and 12 monkeys). Plus the whole plot is just way over the top. It tries to appeal to a smart audience, but I think it can only appeal to a dumb one. This film total insults Capitalism and America. It tries to make some political statements, but it is just a 2 hour piece of garbage. I should have known better than to rent this weak movie. The movie cover simply has a picture of a bar of pink soap! That should have told me not to watch it, but since the reviews were kind of good, I rented it anyway. That's the last time I watch something with a piece of pink soap on the movie cover.",0
"Honestly this movie marks some fresh and new to cinema. Great film making style and plot. Direction and cast was good too.But here comes the boom.....this film represents the modern era where anything can be sold to the fools just by advertising and wrapping it in a catchy packing.So while watching this movie i was feeling as if i am getting sick literally but i just watched it because of its high rating. The film talks about releasing self from limitations and lack of emotional strength, so far so good, but a dying patient can't be cured by hypnosis. It is a useless effort. Now our patient is dying, death is playing its game and his relatives around him....all those who loved the movie....thinks that due to hypnosis their beloved patient is not crying that means not feeling pain that means getting cured. Now that's what i call FOOL's GOLD. Honestly again but i am not buying this stuff.",0
"I saw this movie about 3 years ago for the first time, and I was impressed. I really liked that movie very much. I got the blu ray quality now, and decided to check it out again. After I finished watching this movie I told to myself:""This is so stupid!"". This movie does not make any sense. It is the movie about some psycho schizo guy. I don't know how why it's got 8.8 rating. If you look at this movie seriously, you can find so many mistakes and errors, and so much stupidity in that movie. I will never want to see this movie again in my life! Luckily you can download any movie for free nowadays before buying it. I give this movie 1 star for good actors only. If there were different actors, 1 star would be too much. Other than that this movie is a big mistake!",0
"The time directors made « weird » movies to appeal to teenagers, who needed more of everything. Even things they didn't know they needed. Different times. Today the movie got stale, and the rest of the « trend » look like master pieces of subtle writing, compared to it. I tried rewatching it the other night, what a chore. I already knew the twist, so the whole experience was pointless, plus I forgot how chatty and drawn out the script was. Everything that used to be « cool » about it, is now outdated and ridiculous. For example, the scene where the « hero » blackmails his boss. It wouldn't work today, too much technology. But did it ever? If I remember correctly, surveillance cameras existed, even back then. So how was it even possible to pull that off?... The whole « philosophy » of the movie don't exist outside of it. That's why I rated it so low, it wasn't a bad movie back then. It just isn't working outside of its scope. Call me naive, but isn't a good movie supposed to pass the test of time and leave a mark? This one clearly failed at both. Plus the acting is a bit awkward at times, especially Brad Pitt's... And none of the characters are remotely likeable let alone redeemable.",0

"I had high hopes in this movie with all the positive reviews I saw. But in the end it became the worst movie I saw in my life. In other words, I was disgusted by just seeing him, I couldn't stand being in my seat, I wanted to stop and change the movie. And that's saying a lot. There is a Mexican novel that I thought was the worst in history. I was wrongStarting with the disastrous script that was not going anywhere, someone tell the director that he is making a movie, the dialogues looked like those of a book. I never read it, but it shows that it was copied faithfully. I felt as if the author was smoking marijuana while writing the book, there is quite a chance that it is true. It was an insult to writers who at least know that someone is going to read their works and they take seriously the construction of the plot by making a beautiful rise and fall with the subplots. Arriving at a conclusive climax.Contrary to the fight club that throws up the viewer showing random scenes without relevant content and sex scenes or related things without context that did not contribute to the plot just because, ""I am very depressed and edgy""In the end it is only a film that was the most popular because certain stupid Yanks had never seen any work related to depression and went to the first film they saw of that style and called it a masterpiece to reflect their pathetic life in that. 1/10",0

"David Fincher's screen adaptation of the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, 'Fight Club' was a box office debacle when released, but has gained a cult following over the years. In my opinion, this 'zany' film caters to a niche audience.'Fight Club' is weird & abstract. Not every cine-lover will understand what's going on, especially the climax, which is very confusing. Honestly, Some films are meant to be made & 'Fight Club' is one of those films. It doesn't matter who praises or hates it, it's just there.Fincher is a accomplished genius of a filmmaker. His body of work is simply remarkable. I am fan, indeed! Jeff Cronenweth's Cinematography stands out. Acting wise, Edward Norton steals the show with a winning performance. This is amongst his finest works. Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic, as always. Brad Pitt's performance has potential.On the whole 'Fight Club' is undoubtedly the wackiest novel-turned-into a film. Reccmended to all!",0
"I have been attempting to watch IMDb's top-rated movies for some time, and I rented ""Fight Club"" with anticipation. I had breezed over the Palahniuk book and had been intrigued with the subject matter - I was looking forward to seeing how a capable cast and director would turn out the material into a film that was so highly rated here. Would this be a bullseye like ""The Goodfather"" or an overrated episodic fable like ""Shawshank Redemption""?Much like the subject matter, the film hits you right in the face from the beginning. The Narrator is on a quest for understanding. He initially explores this through encounter groups that challenge his ability to express vulnerability and to get in touch with his feelings. His quest remains elusive, and he meets the main female character Marla in the groups. She is also struggling. On a business trip flight, he meets Tyler, a soap salesman. His relationships with Marla and Tyler takes us through the rest of the film.I will not attempt to describe the plot and evolution of the characters - this has been done quite well by others without exposing spoilers. I will say that this movie walks a veritable tightrope in the manner of Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Hung Kam-Bo. The first half of the film is dynamic, with tight crisp direction, cinematography, and dialogue - the characters are fleshed out and you believe them. Unfortunately, it begins to lose its grip about halfway through. The sense of a coherent ideology interweaved with complex character relationships is overwhelmed as director Fincher goes to the well too often with gratuitous violence. While violence is certainly an extension of the ideology here, the overuse of it convolutes the message. There is also a ""surprise"" that alters the viewer's perception, but it is carried out so implausibly and with such obviousness that the framework is further weakened. Near the end of the film, I began to become bored with the proceedings and had to restrain myself from fast-forwarding to the end. Much has been alluded to here about the ending. Strong symbolism is certainly evident and the ending makes for a great recapitulative exclamation point. But, for a movie that is rated by viewers as the #33 greatest movie of all time, it ain't that great - the ending even becomes obvious as the two competing ""characters"" pull out all stops in advance. Movies such as ""Public Enemy"", ""La Bete Humaine"", ""White Heat"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""The Matrix"", and even the passive symbolism of ""Castaway"" made a greater impression on me.I found ""Fight Club"" to 1/2 of a very good film, but this is ultimately unsatisfying. And what about the film's point of masculine evolution? The message of an enlightenment through aggressive clanship in hand with passive isolation has been explored in countless films to much better effect, including ""American Me"", ""Lord of the Flies"", ""Brassed Off"" (yes!), and particularly ""A Clockwork Orange"". The latter film is probably the best exemplification of this idea.Overall, ""Fight Club"" doesn't contain enough to build a true ideology, mythology, or any real lasting impression for me. Its points become too obvious and blatant to give it any more than a 5.",0
"l have seen the movie, and skipped the end (l was TOLD that it is the most important part, and they also told me what it was). l just couldn't stand it. l know l have to see it again someday in order to have an idea about the full piece, but l just find it repellent...l think it is violent beyond any good taste, and nothing justifies it - the end is not important, not strong enough, and not worthy sitting for so long, watching something l can see if l open my news on TV. when l saw it, it was broadcasted with no censorship (""+13"", for example), and beyond the fact l had no idea what l am about to see, l could have entered to this movie with my little brother, who is too young and cannot filter it.l heard opinions that were fascinated by the philosophic side - the ""philosophy"" in it can be compared to Paulo Coalo's and Richard Bach's literature - not very deep, very commercialized, and it forced you to see things that you are not aware to their influence on you in the process.",0
"If you think everything that you don´t understand is ART, than this movie is for you.I´ll cut it short: it is a very interesting intro, the second act is still good, but the third act and especially the ending is plain stupid. It just doesn´t work that.So please don´t insult people who don´t like that film by saying ""you just don´t get it"". And don´t come up with that ""it makes you think!"" - crap.
If you are puzzled at the end of the movie, it doesn´t mean necessarily that it is intellectual or philosophical, it is - in most cases and especially in this one - it is just bad writing/directing!This movie comes up with a ""twist"" you had no chance at all to see it coming. This is cheap. And the explanation is just impossible: The author thinks you´re an idiot and hopes to get away with this. And I don´t like movies like this.4/10 Macaulay J. Connor",0
"One of the worst movies that I have seen in recent years.  The story is all over the place and depressing as hell.  I thought the movie was about underground fighting and betting on it.  Unfortunately, it is about an idiot's ideal of the darker side of his life.  I like Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, but I would rather watch Seven or Primal Fear over and over again than watch another minute of Fight Club.",0
"""Fight Club"" is worth seeing for its technical feats. Like ""Three Kings,"" it heralds the digital revolution that really emerged in 1999 and promises (or threatens, depending on your perspective) to radically alter cinematic language. But unfortunately, it's mostly style over substance. You'll find fans here and elsewhere praising the film for its message, but it's sometimes hard to tell what ""message"" they're talking about. Is it the rather easy attack on consumerism? The constant griping about lost machismo? The thread of generational conflict? All these underdeveloped ideas are simultaneously celebrated and undercut by the film, especially as the ""fight club"" phenomenon started by Tyler Durden/The Narrator spins out of control. Are we to accept anything that comes out of Tyler's mouth? Or are we to see through his rants as the product of a muddle-headed (and maybe crazy) wannabe culture critic? By the time the film's twist becomes clear, its story and philosophy have become so jumbled that everything falls apart. We're left with an impressively made movie without any real heart or soul, as empty as the consumer culture it supposedly critiques. (I can't help but note the fact that this is a big studio, big budget movie with big money stars and a big ad campaign. How sly that it in the end it props up the culture that gave it life.) It's a screen on which angry young men can project their pet obsessions, but for the rest of us it's hollow.",0
"The violence and filming methods made this movie the most disturbing.  I enjoy a good violent film every now and then, but this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth and a sick feeling in my stomach.  Took me 2 hours to finally drift into an uneasy sleep.  DEFINITELY not one that I would see again...for sure not letting my 16 year old watch it. The only redeeming quality of the film was the twist at the end.",0
"I don't think I've ever been put off a film by its violent content .. until this one. You come out of it feeling like you've been swimming in a tub full of offal. After two hours or so it really starts to become boring, which is disturbing in itself. After it finished though, and I got the more disgusting images out of my mind somewhat, I thought, it really doesn't make much sense either - did anyone ever hear of data backups, maybe? and just how do you wire up a condemned old house for a heap of electronic gismos to conduct a urban warfare campaign? Cronenberg manages all the creepiness and shocking images (e.g. Videodrome) without stooping to the goriness that this film revels in.",0
"""Fight Club"" is a graphically stylish movie that vainly claims itself to being a thoughtful film, but whose effect in the end, is to aestheticize and condone the ideas it purports to examine. It is simply a violent, anti-social, and misogynist film hiding behind a veil of being a kind of psycho/social critique or expose on the masculine entity and the effect on it by North American values.I personally have no problem in the case of a truly artful and intelligent film making an argument for polemical statement and extremism; this is definitely not the case here. Content-wise, it is undeftly handled material; I think because the filmmaker was so utterly concerned with the making of certain visual moments and lost grip of the whole. I fear for all the angry young males in our society that may see this film and become inspired to re-enact the imagery.""Fight Club"" reminds me of a film that may have began as an interesting and compelling idea, but then in the course of its making, gets ""Hollywooded"". It has several fine visual moments that are in turn subverted by equally horrible ones. It insults the viewer over and over;  by employing pedantic, heavy-handed and contradictory motifs such as the highly militaristic yet zombie-esque 'army' to propagate ""mayhem""; by so glibly setting up what ultimately turns out to be a literal interpretation of multiple personality disorder (I suppose juxtaposing incongruous elements was the means).Too much visuals technology, probably too much budget and attention on the bottom line, not enough attention on structure and content, while pretending to be an ideas film, makes this an insulting and perhaps even, a dangerous movie. I wouldn't want to be working in a building who principal tenant is a credit card company for the next while.",0
"The early stages of David Fincher's Fight Club make great promise to a movie that deserves more than what is unwound. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both show their acting gumption, but it is lost on a convoluted message around halfway through and ultimately wasted during an ending that does no less than insult the viewer's intelligence. I've seen movies featuring giant bunny rabbits forecasting the end of the world that have more relevant things to say than what's presented here.Grade A for those that are able to have nonsensical plot threads, piled in a messy heap, served to them with a shovel. Watch the first half hour and turn it off.",0
"There is no arguing that Fight Club was an allegory to 9/11. The taliban wanted to prove to America that it's fascist, capitalist, socialist approach to consumerism that they would take down the buildings that were held in high regard to Americans. Tyler Durden and his schizophrenic friend Brad Pitt's character set off to destroy the capitalist America by taking down major banks through soap bombs. I don't want to go into more detail for fear that the government will take me away. You can look it up on google and read the in depth analysis by people who were taken away. The chick's tits were bomb, even though they were CGI. I liked the part where Brad Pitt's character spliced penises into the movie reel and the 12 year old girl was crying because it was bigger than her dad's. make sure to check where your soap was made.",0
"I, for one, hated this movie...I only saw it once and it was a long time ago, so forgive any incorrect references. Personally, I don't know if I saw it again now if my opinion would be different...maybe, but somehow I doubt it.The beginning was interesting enough to entertain me...specifically the whole him going to different group session things as a hobby and then meeting Marla who does the same thing. That's interesting.I think the whole thing started to bore me about when the movie started going nowhere, from what I remember, it was just Marla living there, and Brad Pitt beating the crap out of Edward Norton every night or whatever. It just lost its interest.The end was a cool twist, the whole Tyler thing...it was interesting, but the film as a whole I don't think was just very well presented. Maybe if I'd read the book it'd make more sense.I just think I didn't like it because it didn't make sense to me. I understand this makes me a bit of an outcast because everyone loves Fight Club, but I apologize...just not my taste. If anyone wants to just explain a few key points out for me, or something, that'd be great.Just please don't rip me a new one, because I understand I am like, the ONLY one who doesn't like that movie.""SLIDE!""",0
"Saw this with friends years ago & well wasn't overly impressed back then while others raved about it.Tried to watch recently & really hated it & mainly because of Helena bc's character just excruciating mumbling stomping around chain smoking,but wasn't that alone.Edward Norton just a little too smug,as usual,& the script somewhat on the infantile side to get it's supposed social commentary or statement across",0
"This is too overrated... You will stop watching it in like first half. As compared to other movies in the category, this one is the worst experience.",0
"I suppose the character development was good, and the acting was also good, but this movie had no entertainment value at all. Unlike most people who review movies on here, I don't try to be a critic,pick things apart looking for holes in the plot, and look for some profound meaning. I don't need Hollywood trying to influence my thinking about anything. This was not a chick flick or an action movie that most average guys would watch. I don't know what it was. I get the whole modern man hamster wheel thing where we are utterly spending ourselves trying to acquire the things that corporations advertise and convince us that we need, but we really don't need at all. But the fighting thing for fun and release? Just stupid. I guess some viewers think that they are more intelligent than the rest of us and are able to grasp the deeper meaning, and thus become more enlightened, but if your like me and just love good stories and being entertained, don't watch this show.",0
"This film certainly has its share of fanfare and hype. I really was hoping I would like it even though the trailer didn't impress me. Well, it turned out being worse than I thought. Meanwhile, Fincher continues to get worse with each effort. The only reason I didn't rank this as 1 was on account of the brilliant Ed Norton. Pitt just plays himself the same way he usually does. The violence gets really old quickly and so does the film. This was way too long and pretentious. Fincher has some interesting points with all the IKEA furniture bits. Perhaps it would have been better in an hour TV show like Ray Bradburyesque. About the only amusing scene in the last half of the film was when Norton is beating the crap out of himself in his boss's office. Of course I liked this scene best when Jim Carrey did it in Liar Liar. Fincher obviously thought he was doing something important here with his pop culture references. I suppose I'm not so easily impressed because I don't rely on American mainstream movies for entertainment. Ooops..sorry to burst your bubbles but despite what some people think, Fincher is not God. After Aliens3 he struck gold with the thrilling ""Se7en"" and followed that with the mediocrity of ""The Game"" only to follow that with this rubbish. Then he went off the radar completely after the embarrassing ""Panic Room"". Not even Jodie Foster or Forrest Whitaker could breathe life into that sleep fest. The twist at the end of FC may have worked better if the darn film didn't drag on for another half hour. Then cue the Pixies song to show that we're cool....puke.",0
"I felt sick when I sat and watched Fight Club because of it´s pro-fascist tendencies, and the entire ubermenschenmentality that this film salutes.Sure, the film is very cool to look at but that doesn´t matter when the movie oozes of a terrible message that violence is the ultimate form of purification of the mind and soul. Stay away from this lousy piece of fascistpropaganda! To quote Apocalypse Now: ""The horror, the horror""",0
"This film is a nightmarish mix of PI, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, PSYCHO, and MATRIX with the old TV show ""The Prisoner"" thrown in for good measure. The theme seems to be that macho anarchy is the way to counteract society, social mores, and the social mask we all wear to cover who we really are.One of the weird symbols in the story is soap -- it cleanses, but not in a true sense. It cleanses only out of our vanity and self-destructive need to erase who we are. Heavy, huh?We get a pseudo-Thoreau blended with a psycho-Socrates rejecting phoniness by creating new phoniness and turning the Socratic motto of ""Know Thyself"" on its head. The film makes fun of support groups where people play ""who's the biggest victim"" by depicting characters who are tourists in their own life. Heavy again, huh?There's an in-joke if you look carefully -- Brad Pitt's pretentious self-discovery epic 7 YEARS IN TIBET is playing at a theater in the background of one shot in the film. This seems to be a bit of self-mocking that this movie makes of its own self-discovery journey.To sum it up, I can think only of a line from the wonderful actress Tallulah Bankhead: ""Dahling, there's less here than meets the eye.""",0
"Wow, if ever a movie should be banned, it's probably Fight Club. This movie tries to bury its right-wing message under heaps of strained hip and pretend satire. But watching this movie closely, you'll see, the message is quite clear:Western civilization has been feminized and a violent revolution (led, apparently, by white males) is the only way to turn the clock back to the prehistoric cave times of patriarchy.Ed Norton plays a victim of the consumer society. When the pressures of being completely phony overwhelms him, he invents an alter-ego, played by Brad Pitt. They begin their journey toward liberation from the enlightened, feminist stage of human development, by starting a fight club where men beat each other senseless and find some sort of spiritual release. Some of my feminist friends insist there is latent homoeroticism in this movie, but I wouldn't go so far as to give it that much credit. These men don't love anything, especially each other. No, this is about white men being upset that their day is over and engaging in insanely childish activities in attempt to reclaim their lost power.As a feminist accidentally born with testicles, I can assure you there is no place for movies like this in today's feminist, enlightened society. Ban it if possible. By all means, don't watch it.",0
"Before I begin, I should clarify. I am not giving it three stars because I think it's overrated, but because I genuinely believe that on a scale from Lord of The Rings to Garbage Pail Kids, this movie falls closer to Garbage Pail. And yes I have seen both.To give this movie praise where it's deserved, the movie is high budget with no technological set backs. I can also appreciate the originality of the story. I hate it, but I have never seen anything quite like it before. Also no actor did a bad job. I like Brad Pitt reasonably well, and I love Helena Bonham Carter. The characters they portray are awful, but I do like the actors. The cinematography is sometimes okay. That pretty much wraps up everything positive I have to say about the movie, now lets get to the more interesting part.It's about an insomniac who struggles to find his place in life before he starts joining community groups with various ailments that he pretends to have. My first issue, why does he pretend to have problems? If you go to a community group and say, ""I don't have this issue, but I'm here to support all of you."" are people going to start throwing things and force you to leave? As we jump into the movie, the problems of this guy are presented, and he is so close to resolving them instantaneously. However he starts to lose it, when he discovers, a woman named Marla who is faking it just like him. Does this guy realize his ugly reflection in the mirror when he witnesses someone doing the same thing? Nope, but he still can't stand her for 'reasons', and proposes that the two of them split up groups so they don't have to see each other.The movie then switches gears when our narrator meets a fascinating stranger on an airplane. Tyler is ultra reckless and has a very uncivil approach to life. When the narrator arrives at his home, he comes to find out that his apartment caught fire, and asks to move in with Tyler. Tyler agrees, but before the narrator moves in, Tyler asks him to punch him as hard as he can. This leads to a pretty intense fight, even though they're friends now, they enjoy a hard fight. This leads a bunch of passers by to join in the fight. They all have so much fun with it that they decide to start a fight club. What??? I realize that I'm pretty pacifistic, but don't you fight when you hate someone??? Even if you enjoy beating the crap out of someone, don't you regret dealing with the scratches and scars??? I realize that some things just aren't for me, but I can't understand why it's fun to beat up your friends.As the movie continues, the narrator crosses paths with Marla again. Tyler and Marla basically lose their pants immediately after meeting. Then we get to one of the most annoying scenes I have ever seen. We hear Tyler and Marla moaning in a super dragged out scene that lasts five minutes, while the narrator who still can't stand her, struggles to find a quiet place on the other side of the hall, or downstairs, or in the furthest corner in the basement. I think this scene is supposed to be comedic, but I find it just as annoying as our narrator. I guess I can understand how this might be funny for a twelve year old, while I'm on it, I should just say this entire comedy-drama is not funny.As the movie progresses, the Fight Club gets bigger, more intense, and more dangerous. Also the characters go from bad people,  of the earth. They begin to provoke fights with people outside the club. When the narrator is about to be fired from his job for good reasons, the narrator starts threatening his boss. When the turmoil with his boss gets worse the narrator beats himself up, and blames his injuries on his uninjured boss.Eventually we come to a point where our narrator struggles to find Tyler, so he starts digging up a ton of airplane tickets, and comes to find out that Tyler has traveled all around America, and started fight clubs in every major city. At this point, I had been waiting for two hours for karma to catch up with these people, or for somebody to get a redemption arc, but instead the movie decides to give us a good contender for the worst plot twist ever made. It turns out that our narrator has split personality disorder, and Tyler doesn't really exist!So let me get this straight, When Tyler, and the narrator got into a fight in the beginning, which grabbed the attention, of numerous people on the street, it was really just the narrator beating himself up? When Tyler and Carla have sex, and the narrator is struggling to get away from the noise, it's really just the narrator having sex with Carla and making up crap about what the other him is doing? And the narrator totally blanked on many months, if not years of his life that he would spend traveling from city to city, starting up Fight Clubs throughout America?Well that's what the movie is running with, so I guess I'm supposed to run with it. Every movie that I have seen with a twist relies on an oversight on the viewers part. It adds clarity to things that didn't make sense before. This twist however, makes the entire movie make far less sense. And instead of providing clarity, I feel lied to. You know all that stuff that happened before this twist, a ton of it didn't really happen, we appreciate your understanding for our gaps in logic, yours truly, 20th Century Fox.I hear all the time in movies like this that you need to watch it a second time and notice all the hints you missed the first time. I only saw this movie once, and I'm not seeing it again, but looking back at the hints, the two of them bought the same exact suit case, and they both have insomnia issues. Well don't I feel like an idiot for thinking that coincidences happen, obviously I should have realized that it's far more likely that this character really doesn't exist, what great foreshadowing. The only thing I take away from that, is that the writers looked over the script a second time before making this movie. Am I supposed to be impressed? This plot twist literally makes just as much sense as Han Solo being a figment of Luke Skywalker's imagination. In fact every movie that involves two or more characters could have done the same twist. What a great way to ruin all your favorite movies.Anyways the narrator realizes that he's a victim of the dumbest twist in cinema, and the movie becomes a struggle of him ridding himself of his inner Tyler. The narrator and Tyler get into another fight when the narrator tries to stop a bomb that Tyler planted. Of course this fight is just the narrator beating himself up again. The narrator eventually realizes the only way to kill Tyler is to kill himself. So he turns his own gun to his head, and fires killing Tyler, but as luck would have it sparing the parts of his brain that made him the no name narrator that I can't stand.As I'm writing this, Fight Club is the 11th best movie on IMDb, and in a list of 250 movies this isn't falling off anytime soon. What the hell? The Shawshank Redemption is rated number one. While I think it's only okay, it does have some excellent moments, and I can understand why it would be rated number one. I cannot understand why this movie is so highly rated. I really can't understand how this could get mediocre ratings, it's just bad. Every character is unlikeable, and unpleasant. This leads to the entire movie being unpleasant. When the movie decides to give it's unpleasantness a break, it reverts to sheer stupidity. By the end of the movie, the narrator is in a worse spot then where he began. Also this being one of the greatest movies ever, I fear that people who over analyze it will get the message, 'If I'm having mental issues, then I should shoot myself in the head, then maybe I'll feel better.' I do not endorse this movie to anybody whatsoever.",0
At the 5 minutes I was zZzZz. The book I liked much more.,0
"I was actually looking forward to watch this movie... but after watching it, I think it is a crazy ride to nowhere! Mixes chaos theory with organization and leadership, and then makes a U-turn to where it started - the inner struggles of an everyday man.This movie literally tries to mean so much to so many people that I can't believe how anyone can feel connected to it. It uses violence as a show and simple chaos to amuse. Is it worth watching? Sure as the acting is done brilliantly. Will it be remembered and revisited after some time? No, I don't think so...",0
"After years ,,I have finally decided to watch this iconic movie. I had big expectations and read the book before. The acting was real and exciting , but this is art for art sake, or drama for drama sake, so predictable, the author imagine himself as a rebel intellectual, some kind of a modern Kafka, but unfortunately without substance and incredible dark, evil and self destructive. No hope for the audience, the only form of art is the aestethic of ugliness .",0
"If there's any lesson to be learned from this film, it's that good leadership involves fighting yourself. Yes, not a soldier stifled under Washington as he pummeled himself while crossing the Delaware. The Rumble in the Jungle, except the Jungle manifested as a convoluted and nonsensical plot. The movie can be summed up with having Walter Mitty go through a traumatic childhood, and now lives out violent fantasies. Except the movie has no humor, no semblance of calculated dialog, a plot filled with more holes than a road sign off a southern highway. And that would have been bearable... If the movie wasn't so entrenched in pretense and a faux philosophical atmosphere. If Inception were Camus, then Fight Club is Eco. When Norton rolled down the stairs I expected his notes from Philosophy 101 to fly out of his pockets like a pinata from Goodwill. Boring movie, pretentious movie, garbage movie. Fincher possibly at his worst.",0
"David Fincher directed this strikingly provocative and original film that stars Edward Norton as ""The Narrator"" of his own life, a frustrated, beaten-down office worker who chances to meet confident and care-free Tyler Durden(played by Brad Pitt). They become friends and business partners(a soap-making enterprise) then create an underground movement called ""Fight Club"", where men fight each other to let off steam and feel ""alive"". He also meets the beautiful and mysterious Marla(played by Helena Bonham Carter) who attends multiple support group meetings like he does, and begins a relationship with both him and Tyler, and as events grow increasingly violent and bizarre, it becomes clear that Tyler and he are closer than viewer at first realized... Audacious film needs to be seen multiple times to fully comprehend it, though some elements(particularly the ending) are so off-putting some may not bother trying. Superb acting all around, and most funny at times, but wallows in nihilism far too much.",0
"I thought that Edward Norton was sensational in American History X but I found him unconvincing in this film. I did not believe the actors, the plot or much of anything in this frequently violent film. If you get your kicks pounding the beejeezus out of somebody else you might love this film. The sub-plot that I got out of this movie was that young men should have lustful sex with other men just for the fun of it all and then they would be less inclined to run around pounding each other to a pulp. The film was way too long, the plot was simply not believable and the acting was really spotty. But then, what is an actor to do with such a bad script?",0
This movie is total garbage with no redeeming value whatsoever. Don't waste your time.,0
"One of my most anticipated movies for this year, and I walked away from a sneak screening completely devestated along with about everyone else that saw it with me. You couldn't have a better first Act. The second is equally tense, funny, and disturbing. If you don't mind the violence (which I don't) you will be at the end of the second act ready for a incredible explosive conclusion. Instead, the story turns ludicrous and all is explained in a shallow, all-to-easy manner, cheapening-- invalidating the entire film, much in the same way the Game also faltered in the end, but ten time worse, mainly because the film had such potentional, whereas the Game never really does. Acting and directing is superb, but the story obviously works better on paper than on the screen. Still see it, but don't expect to like it.",0
"Snarl! - Snarl! - Snap! - Snap!.....Attention! Attention! Calling all infantile-minded, emotionally immature, adult males who get their jollies playing dress-up in military drag!.... Welcome to the Wilted Wiener Club (aka. Fight Club).You know, I can't believe what a damning statement this demented, little movie makes about the insecurity of today's man and his obvious doubts about his own masculinity. If this film's story wasn't so pathetic it would actually be quite laughable.I find it really quite disturbing and, yes, frightening that the movie Fight Club (which started out at such an ultra-low, base-level mentality as it did) never-ever once rose above that revoltingly stupid level of thought - Not even once.And, finally - I don't care one, single bit about what any adoring, little fan may say, or think, about baby-blue-eyes Brad Pitt(head). 'Cause, let's face it - PITT IS A TERRIBLE ACTOR. He is!I mean, if he really had any talent at all, then he would've rescued this utter piece of junk-food from the dregs of the garbage disposal with his ""magnetic"" charisma. But, as far as Fight Club goes, Brad Pitt(iful) was just as vile as the movie itself was.",0
"Good but strange, I saw it in the cinema and it was a little bit scary",0
"OK, normally I identify with punk movies, but this one just doesn't work out. It is an aimless odyssey into a void of aimless people that moves along without direction. PS - another reason to hate this film: I believe the trend towards male frontal nudity in film started with this POS. I hate this movie even more than Freddie Got Fingered, and that is hard to do. This movie was supposed to invoke some sort of anti-corporate, primal rage sort of message, but it just didn't work.",0
"After whinging to his doctor about his insomnia, a frustrated office worker (Edward Norton, whose character is simply called The Narrator) is advised to attend a support group for testicular cancer to see what real suffering is like; there, he experiences an emotional release that finally allows him to get some much needed shut-eye. Consequently, The Narrator becomes addicted to support groups, feigning illness to attend, but the appearance of another such 'tourist', Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), makes him feel awkward about his dishonesty, and he once again struggles to sleep.While flying home from a business trip, The Narrator strikes up a conversation with travelling soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The pair part company at the airport, but when The Narrator discovers that his apartment has been blown up in a freak accident, he calls the number on Durden's business card. The guys meet up and strike up an unlikely friendship which sees The Narrator discovering another solution to his sleep issues: bare knuckle bouts with Durden. Eventually, other guys looking for a release from their mundane existences join in the fun, and Fight Club is born.For a film dealing with ***Spoiler Alert!!!*** dual personality, it seems only fitting that I'm in two minds about Fight Club.I appreciated the sentiment that 'you are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank, you are not the car you drive, you're not the contents of your wallet', but disliked the script/story as a whole, which is full of contrivances, inconsistencies and quasi-intellectualism.I loved the dark humour and the brutality of the fight scenes (although cannot accept for one minute that men would line up to be beaten to a pulp), but I hated director David Fincher's showy approach to the rest of the film, which is over-reliant on slick CGI trickery (that actually looks very dated by today's standards).I admired Edward Norton's performance, but disliked Pitt's, and hated Bonham Carter's.I hated the silly twist that could be seen a mile away, but was amused by the subliminal image that appears seconds before the end, and enjoyed hearing The Pixies over the closing credits.To reflect my mixed feelings about Fight Club, I give it a middling rating of 5/10.",0
"one of the most overrated movies in IMDb.trust me, i was really intrigued to watch the film after one of my friend told me it's awesome.but it was a complete letdown.it wasn't even good at all.it's crazy to such an extent that i hated it.although i liked the performances a lot.when you came to know at the end that Tyler is only a figment of the narrator's personality ,you will be like , then what the hell was happening through the entire film. the narrator blew up his own condo? man,this is the dumbest thing i can ever imagine.honestly it was not that bad ,but extremely overrated.did you guys even see the film before rating it? going by the rating i was really expecting something that's gonna blow me away.it sure does,my head./",0
"This film had been on my to-watch list for some time now and I had decided to (more ended up) watching it. I was expecting a lot considering its 8.8/10 rating on IMDb.Unfortunately I did not enjoy it. Im going to agree with Roger Ebert on this film and say it was trying to be like Seven or Usual Suspects with its dramatic twist, which I unfortunately guessed half way through (it wasn't hard) which took some of the film away from me.Also it had this feel to it like a poor mans film. A film for thick people. I can see massive jock idiots coming from that film saying ""I LOVED THE BIT WHERE HE HIT HIM WITH HIS FIST DURRRRRR"" ""OH YER MAN AND THE TWIST DUDE, WE ARE SO INTULEKTUCAL WATCHING THAT FILM"" (not to say if you like this film your an idiot) The violence is almost pornographic like the saw films are with the horror and the ""meaning"" of the film seems to be violence will help solve the world.Though it has its bad points it has some good. the acting isn't bad and some of the cinematography is excellent, especially in the first half.Also the first part of the film with the narrative and the flip in order of the storyline is good. All in all the start is great but a faltering end and the overall feel of the film is not good. 5/10",0
"I just recently saw fight club and I must say I think that it is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. (Actually, second because crash is the most overrated, how did that win best picture) All of my friends talked about how good it was but I always stayed away from this movie. I did enjoy the fight scenes and in the beginning, I was captivated by the plot. Things soon begin to come apart. It was really good until it dipped into the terrorism theme. All of a sudden the movie switched gears and never recovered. Does this really deserve to be in top 50? I don't think so. Brad Pitt was good. Edward was good but this was not their best. What do you think?",0
"For two-thirds of it's length this film offers some of the most bracing black comedy ever to emerge from Hollywood. Unfortunately the resolution of it all as some kind of apocalyptic thriller is pathetic and forces a downward re-evaluation of what has passed before. As with ""Se7en"" David Fincher shows an inability to get through a film without resorting to cliche. Although this sounds negative I would still applaud the ambitions, although worryingly ""Panic Room"" leads one to believe that this represents an end rather than a beginning.",0
"This movie could have been great, it could have been something special. It just fails in every way. It has one of the worst endings to a movie I have ever seen. Horrible special effects and a very predictable and silly ending.",0
"I'm afraid I was expecting a lot more,this was a huge disapointment.I felt it was disjointed rambling and lacking any purpose.Why is it no. 38 on the list?Watch se7en,American history x,A clockwork orange....anything but this self indulgent crap.",0
"I belive that this is a film that speaks out against anarchy. Yet to a large portion of this films audience, teenagers, it does not get that message across. Most high-schoolers leave this film only remembering the insane ramblings of the god-like Brad Pitt character Tyler Durden. In that sense, this film contradicts itself. Also, I did not find this film enjoyable. Not the first time a watched it, not the second time and not the third time. Sure, I laughed a couple times and some of the fight scenes were cool, but those aspects did not make up for this cluttered picture. Plus the CG cinematography was very out of place, as it is in Fincher's superior piece, PANIC ROOM.",0
"After viewing this film, I begin to wonder if the filmmakers want us to believe that every man wants to ultimately rebel and then flog themselves to near death for doing so.   Evidently, they have that vision of despair; that lack of faith in humanity.Perhaps some call it artistic expression, but pure cynical humour, to me, is self-indulgent garbage.   All it does is propagate more confusion in a blatant refusal to understand.Where Se7en had brilliance -- in the display of the seven deadly sins, the clarity of each character, the horror of the consequence of action -- Fight Club almost displays the horror of human life itself, and that's just plain bad art.Yes, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are wonderful in it.  But why are they in it? If the filmmakers are so unhappy with themselves and humanity, they should at least give us a vision of how they feel things SHOULD be!  Or let someone else get greenlighted that can at least appreciate something about humanity. Sell your soap somewhere else.  I ain't buying it!",0
"In the company of my brother and a friend we started to watch this film. The friend left, bored, and went to bed. My brother fell asleep. I barely managed keep my eyes open and see it through. We must've missed something, considering the raving reviews of other users... or maybe we were just very tired.",0
"Not many of the young men praying at this movies alter seem to realize that the film's ending totally derails its entire philosophy up to that point. Till then, this somewhat intoxicating rant against consumer society and the emasculation of the modern male had at least been consistent.  The 'surprise' twist and 'happy' ending seem to negate everything that had come before and make it nothing more than a succession of stunningly filmed images surrounded by the character study of a psychotic.  The protagonist is basically a loner who needs not only society's recognition, but also the love of a woman.  When he can't get these, he turns to violence.  TAXI DRIVER explored this theme much better.  He also has the need to be someone else, see through others eyes, -- role-play a little.  That aspect is explored much better in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.  In the end, though FIGHT CLUB looks great and has some great moments it just does not work well as a film. Many have called this movie the ""CLOCKWORK ORANGE of the 90's"".  Not a chance.  In twenty years Stanley Kubrick's film will still be viewed as a classic.  FIGHT CLUB will by then be nothing but a distant memory.  Final rating, a disappointing 5 out of 10.Another thought.  For over two hours (before the quick-fix happy ending), this movie advocates violence as a way that men can re-establish their place in society.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things that could stand improvement in this world and even American society.  There's certainly room for change.  But not this way.  This film's message is a dangerous one that might be taken to heart by many angry and impressionable young men everywhere.  Think about it, ---what makes Ed Norton's character here any different than the skinhead he played in AMERICAN HISTORY X?  At least in that film his conversion into a tolerant and decent human being was far more gradual and believable.  Those who have blindly embraced FIGHT CLUB's philosophy without seeing these underlying faults and contradictions should view it again from this new perspective.  It will give you food for thought.Lastly, I'd like to point out that I'm perplexed regarding the very high ratings this film seems to be getting from female voters.  This is somewhat surprising considering that it is quite anti-female and condescending to women.  Perhaps this has something to do with the magnetic presence of Brad Pitt.  But then again, that's 'another' form of blinding oneself isn't it.",0
"There are many fascinating aspects to this movie and it is eminently watchable (if you can take violence) but most of the thoughts behind it break down with even the slightest examination.  A pretty face, but little more.",0
"**minor spoilers**Sure, the film is visually spectacular, as all Fincher pieces are.  The picture is slick, you've got a couple 21st century icons in Norton and Pitt, a palatable attempt at nihilistic pseudo-social commentary, and the occasional moment of brilliance (ie, ""Slide!"").  Oh yes, and the gratuitous violence.I enjoyed the first act. All the elements were there; Pitt is excellent, and Norton is steady. Bonham-Carter gives her least annoying performance ever. The film is fast-paced, and has its share of innovation.  The messages that it alludes to are more-or-less subtle.  So far, so good.Then comes Project Mayhem. Something about soldiers or what-not. Anarchy disguised as a cause.  An excuse for the audience to enjoy more blatant violence on the screen.  The movie completely loses its direction the moment Fight Club tries to be more than it is-- both the organization in question, and the film itself.  From here on in, we have to endure Pitt's character's constant, irrelevant, and usually flawed, babble.  Example: the convenience store ""hold-up"", and chemical burn scenes.  And don't forget the deeply insightful line, ""Self-improvement is masturbation"".The message of anti-consumerism was already established early on in the film by Norton's character; it was unnecessary for Pitt to ram it down our throats for the rest of the movie.  The radical post-capitalism, year-zero philosophy is also nothing new. Anyone socially and politically aware in the 70's and 80's are familiar with the Cambodian Khmyr-Rouge vision.  This is pretty much irrelevant, though, since Fincher is catering to the teenage North American male.  I suspect that most of the rave reviews for The Fight Club are from this demographic. Who else would buy into the forlorn suburban working-class white male rage bit so easily?  Yes, folks. Your angst will disappear by kicking the hell out of each other.To cap off this deeply flawed movie is another Keyser Soze ending. As unconvincing as its like in Sixth Sense, it seemed more like an effort to get people back in the theatres a second time than a well-thought, intrinsic element of the plot.The Fight Club might have succeeded if it dealt away with its temptation to say something important, and stuck to a collage of pretty shots of men wailing at each other, talking penguins, and Norton covered in human fat. Four minutes would've sufficed.",0
"S**t - I had a whole review written and then I accidentally hit escape and erased the whole thing.Basically Fight Club was bad.  Which is really unfortunate because I was looking forward to another great film from David Fincher.I read over some of the other comments made by users here, and I was really surprised that every single one I read was a positive review.  It really makes me wonder about the film-going public...I actually thought the premise itself was quite interesting - lonely guy seeks way to connect with other individuals in the modern world.  Going to the support groups was interesting, forming fight club with ""Tyler Durden"" was interesting.  Somehow though I just wish that guys could vent their frustrations or anger or unhappiness without resorting to violence - though I am starting to see that is an impossibility.  It must be coded into their genes (which is a REALLY good excuse - I love that one...)Now don't misunderstand me - I am not squeamish about violence - some of the fight sequences were well done and I enjoyed them - it is a rare thing that I will turn my eyes away in horror because of violence - there is a perverse fascination with it in my psychological make-up and I am certainly not the only one.  But when I was sitting watching the film (and I honestly wasn't too thrilled about it already because it was just a bit boring) during the scene where Edward Norton beats the blond kid to a shadow of his former self, I became offended.  And not specifically because of the beating.  That was horrifying and I think (hope?) most people would find it horrifying. What offended me was the handful of young men who were whooping and cheering the beating on from the audience.  That was frightening.I don't think it is arguable that this film does glorify violence in a very bad way.  It makes it cool to beat people up and to get beaten up. Other reviews I read argued that it doesn't glorify violence because it makes the drones in Durden's terrorist army look stupid or something.  Well yes they do look stupid - I don't think that people go out looking to be a stupid ""drone"" but they do look for leadership (ie Nazi Germany).  Furthermore it seems to me that more people would be interested in being Tyler Durden. That is how it glorifies violence with respect to terrorist organizations - it wouldn't necessarily make you want to follow in one, it makes it look cool to lead one.  I would like to think that people are not stupid enough to fall for that kind of thing, but I know I am wrong and I think Fincher gives the general public to much credit for intelligence and being able to think on their own.Moving on - I hated the ""twist"" [details deleted].  How lame, what a predictable cop out.  And I thought it was poorly done - implausible if you look back at the rest of the film.  That really put the nails in the coffin of this film.I actually thought Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter were pretty good.  I wonder how different the original screenplay looked from the finished product.One other thing - I read a review from an LA critic that stated that the worst thing about this film is that it THINKS it conveys a message.  Close - I think it TRIES to convey a message but whatever that message was, it is not effectively conveyed.  Sure it says consumerism ans capitalism are bad, it then goes on to say fight the system with whatever (violent) means necessary...  And does not really contradict that message ever.  Is this the message Fincher intended?  I do not think that Norton's character running around trying to make things right at the end (when it was clear that that was impossible) turns around the core message of the film...  What a disaster.",0
"I think that the place that Fight Club was headed in the beginning was much more interesting than the place where it wound up in the end. It's almost like the producers saw Sixth Sense and decided that they needed a cool twist ending too and threw one in as an afterthought. Suffering from the same disease as The Matrix, three very good movies could have been made from ideas in Fight Club. Instead, they tossed all of them into one film, cheapening each of them and diffusing what focus the movie might have had. While the film does have a very hip look and a great feel, I couldn't help feeling cheated at the end.",0
"Here's an idea.  Write a movie that explores the idea of a pawn in society turning to anarchist ideals.  Have the transformation happen in a unique setting.  Take the idea to extremes.  Throw in some unredeemed violence to give it that authentic gutter feel of anarchism.Okay, now you have the plot of a pretty decent movie.  Oh, wait, though. We should add a plot twist.  Hmmmm, but the twist will cause some of our scenes to make no sense.  Oh well, most of the movie is already printed, lets just finish it and call the loose ends artistic license.The only problem is the twist pretty much ruins the movie.  Oh sure, it makes you rethink the early parts, and adds a clever uncertainty to the original experience, but the twist just doesn't hold up.  How can many of the earlier scenes be plausibly explained?  The final scenes of the movie just let the air out of the whole plot (the twist didn't work in my mind, and the final sixty seconds made me think that the writers couldn't figure out how to finish off the movie).Good acting by Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.  Brad Pitt has done this same character before in Twelve Monkeys.Compare this movie to momento, however, and you'll find that momento manages to pack in a much more devilish twist that makes you rethink the whole experience and doesn't leave you saying ""but hold on a second, how could that other scene have happened""?",0
"Sorry, gang;  I'm giving this a thumbs down.  This pic has great cinamatography and art direction but that only makes it a video, not a movie.The director and writer had a few ideas for half a movie but couldn't think of anything else while the bills piled up.  The first act was good enough but would have been better if it had made up it's mind where it was going. Too many scenes which promised something proved to be red herrings while others just plain dragged.  The last act summed up nothing which went on before;  it also introduced character relationships and elements which hadn't been seen earlier. Thus the story arc was a complete wreck.  On top of all that, the whole movie runs some 30 to 40 minutes too long.  All of which are the classic signs of poor direction and writing.  It brings to mind the fiasco that was Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991).
It started out as an off-beat buddy movie and ended as cheesy, pyschodramatic wish-fulfillment shlock on a par with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) except with a bigger budget and no catchy songs.  It calls out, `look at me!' but then says nothing else, hoping a fashionably alienated, post-ironic attitude will make up the difference.  It never did and never will.",0
"I agree completely with the negative critics statements on the inside of the DVD.  This movie's defenders have tried to pass it off as ""cerebral"" and ""psychological"" on this very page, and as a ""profound portrait of how corporations ruin our lives.""  It is none of these.  First of all, what makes people think it's cerebral?  The endless whining?  The laughable ""we're all the middle children of history"" attempts at philosophizing?  The hardly novel idea that men need to have an outlet for their pent-up aggression?  And the leftist idea (which has been out there since at least the time of Marx) that corporations have been destroying our lives and screwing us over?  Praise the movie as cerebral, and you'd better be cerebral yourself to recognize it.  Get yourself a book of Dostoyevsky or Kant and see how you handle real deep thought.  Second off, that it's psychological.  Simple because the main character has a certain mental disorder (I won't be so bad to reveal what it is), is it psychological?  After we see the character's illness in the movie, it seemed to me Norton fighting Pitt was like a bad Candid Camera joke.  I was half-expecting the director to come on after the scene and say, ""You took that scene seriously?  Sucker!""  It's amazing what this movie expects you to believe, particularly after the plot twist which, like the Usual Suspects (to which it has been often compared) is just too clever by a half, and voids entire sections of the movie.  I'm a fan of Ed Norton because I like his work.  I also liked Seven quite a bit, so I can hardly be dismissed as a Fincher-hater.  And I still agree that men in our society are fundamentally demasculinized in a way previous generations never had to deal with.  But after seeing this movie, I think the solution may be worse than the cure.",0
"Okay, so here it is, the ultimate ""Anarchy rules"" movie of the late 90s. I had heard a lot about the film and was very eager to finally see it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in nearly every bit - I thought the movie was sometimes boring, sometimes way to violent and sometimes plain silly.But first for the good parts: Great cinematography and a really surprising point at the end when Edward Norton learn something about himself... it was this final change of pace that kept me from giving this movie a ""1 out of 10"" rating...But now for the worst parts:Incredibly idiotic monologue sequences. Edward Norton keeps on babbling about whatever you do not want to hear. Meaningless chatter which really starts getting on your nerves after a short while.Gratuitous violence. Excessive portrayals of men beating on other men already lying helpless on the floor. Now, this might have been one important point the film wanted to show, that people tend to be cruel to each other once the barriers in the mind have fallen down - but well, I found out that I just was appalled by this and could see no point in repeatedly seeing bloody people being delivered to a hospital...Unbelievable story developments. Suddenly, practically everybody seems to be a member of the Fight Club. They are not only everywhere, they are getting more and more aggressive in their attempts of destroying society. Things are getting out of hand - I had a hard time swallowing what the director wanted us to believe here...All in all, as I said in the beginning, a very disappointing movie with a splendid basic idea - the point I was talking about that changed the whole perception of what happened before. This point somehow reminded me of the ""Sixth Sense"", but it was not administered in such a brilliant fashion, though some scenes of the film made more sense in the aftermath. Still, as a whole I did not like it, the good parts came to late to save it.",0
"""The Fight Club"" attempts to dramatize the frustrations of modern man caught up in routine and unfulfilling jobs . . . and ways in which this ""pent-up steam"" can be released through violent male bonding.Unfortunately, the scripters got caught up in their own outrageous creations, taking their points to an ultimate extreme and ridiculous conclusion.Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter all give admirable performances.",0
"Yes, I know that this movie shouldn't be taken at face value. People fighting people in their own little ""Fight Club."" So much of the movie is nothing but that (hence the title, I suppose). But it has a deeper meaning, some would say. It fights crass commercialism (while being a film FILLED with that very commercialism). It shows how life is meaningless unless you do something different. WOW! Didn't know that one! Thanks, Fight Club!The movie is a jumbled mess, and the writers and producers are just lucky that people will pay to see practically anything with star power. They're also fortunate that so many people apparently had no idea of the fundamental things the movie so haphazardly tries to demonstrate. Of course, the actual INTENT of the film is kind of debatable. Seeing it without knowing what the writers had in mind, one could come to any number of conclusions, and I'd guess that there could be any number of interpretations. That's the only point of interest of this film. Of course, since that's true of any film, no matter how bad, it's not really a largely redeeming quality.
***Spoilers follow***You don't see the ending coming because it's so ludicrous! Try dragging yourself across a parking garage floor sometime. Go ahead! And be sure to have some gauze handy when you have those unsightly head wounds.",0
"This movie deliberately deceives you.Like with a good fraudster there are many positive aspects: Immaculate acting and visuals, positive messages (e.g. there is enormous potential within your self - free it), good pacing, a nice story twist (which seems not to be based on any significant holes in the story line) and abundant food for thought.All this pales against what appears to be the main and effectively only concern of the movie: Glorification of a Herrenmenschen-fascist-woman-hating-sadistic type of male homosexuality. There is still much to improve in our societies for gay people and this movie does respective efforts not any good (to say the least).Most disturbingly one can observe this tendency in the female lead which is cast as a sex- and brainless rag-doll useful only for the release of sexual aggression (which she actually likes and deserves because she is ""a predator posing as a pet"" - a role model for women in general?).The final scene does not imply anything else, because in the end it is Taylor who prevails - as can be inferred by his last splice-in.",0
What a pitty!! I really wasted my time for this disgusting movie! I don't know why this movie ratings is very high I can't believe it.. shame on the people that rated this movie high ?,0
"It is a movie that is difficult to understand in its first presentation. It is very necessary to review it in order to understand. It criticizes capitalism and exposes the ills of consumer society with a Marxist view, and portrays and describes the narrator's schizophrenia through multiple projections of his own person. The film is cult, but long and boring, and in my view, super-overated. grade 2/10",0
"It baffles me to see Fight Club get such a high score to rank in the top 25 of all time. Never before has a film been more deserving of a 5/10.The first half of the film is exceptional. The narration draws you in, Norton's character is compelling to watch, and when Tyler Durden (Pitt) is introduced, the idea of self-destruction as the way forward, rejecting the norms imposed on society and acting in accordance with the essence of man, for good or for bad are amongst the fascinating issues explored subtly for the viewer to think about.The film should have continued like this, but instead decides to impose a bizarre twist, suddenly focusing on a plot rather than the character-based psychological issues previously being explored, which just descends into complete chaos, with unbelievable subplot after unbelievable subplot, which left me overwhelmed and regretting the demise of the intriguing first half of the film, which I am sure I'll watch over and over again before switching it off at the appropriate point.For many, I am sure, the unveiling of the big twist around the middle of the film will spark it into life as the film develops a real story, but for me it did not need a spectacularly unbelievable ending, it had it all from the start, but lost its way and never recovered.",0
"I like Brad Pitt. I really like Edward Norton. But (without all the !!!'s) I have to agree with a previous poster: what a waste! This film tries to wrap something romantic around some pretty pointless destructive, and self-destructive behaviour. It then tries a cop-out ending by ... nope, that would be a spoiler, wouldn't it? It's cinematically interesting in places, in the course of exploring ""How low can you go?"". But this film is clearly written with a message: a subtle advocacy of just going blam random, that makes me grieve.If you've given up on anything positive in life, and figure injuring yourself is less boring, then you may see more in this film than I do. Any action film will skip past the real likely outcomes of getting smashed in the head over and over again. This film tries to suggest there's a higher principle, while throwing reality out the window ... and then wets itself because there's no place to go.",0
"This movie is so dreary and pretentious it's difficult to sit through, at least for me. Spoiler: I can see that a character could convince himself that he's someone else or that a fictional character could exist in his mind. I find it completely implausible that all the people around him would be fascinated and inspired by his delusion while watching him beat himself up in a parking lot, or that he would be able to inspire these same people to help him cover up his own fictional character's non-existence, and that they would go out and blow up buildings for him. The screenplay asks you to believe this. A friend of mine compared this film to Memento which has a similar belief by the main character, but his self-made reality isn't encouraged by anyone else except in cases where they can exploit him. Fight Club has some interesting ideas but I'd call it a mildly interesting failure.",0
"While I have seen worse movies than Fight Club, this movie does not warrant a second viewing. While its gotcha twists are interesting they really push the barrier and for not a whole lot of result. While I think there is a story in this movie, I did not find it well made or particularly well written. And I did not see anything that I would call funny. (or brilliant for that mater.)Acting is OK. Writing is OK (which is better than average these days) but it seemed like a silly exercise rather than a story. Maybe its an age thing-I am 50 and twists just don't impress me as much anymore. Maybe its a female thing- the fighting seemed to go on and on and on. And while clever, in the end it seemed just stupid.",0
"Having seen this movie over a year ago, all I can remember about it is thinking it one of the worst movies I have ever seen (and I've seen a LOT of movies). I was quite surprised to see it in the Top 250, and thought of so highly by reviewers on this site. It made so little an impression on me that I cannot remember one solitary scene or player in it, although I read here that Brad Pitt participated with someone called Ed Norton (Honeymooners?). All I remember is that it pained me to watch the whole thing, but I did. I don't know why. But just in case many of you are holding back your true dislike of this piece of trash because it is just sooo PC to like it, well now the ice is broken.There is no accounting for taste!",0
"This is one of the worst wastes of celluloid ever, right up there with Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Swordfish and Leonard Part 6.  The plot is practically nonexistant, the acting abysmal, the progress of the presented storyline bizzare and illogical, and the ending pointless.  Nihilism is NOT it's own reward, no matter how you butter it up.  POTENTIAL SPOILER:  Destroying everything you can lay hands on is not a purpose in life, it's just destruction.  Any fool can destroy.",0
"Why oh why do I give David Fincher a second chance? My mind always wanders when watching his films and pictures him at various moments over, say, 2 months writing his little ideas down as they come to him. This movie is clearly the culmination of about 20 of those ideas and some that were brought back from the waste paper basket. Strung together with thread bare plotting. Oh and please, David, give your set designer the day off for the next one. He/she's needed at a new theme park to do the haunted house. 2 out of 10. 1 for the lead actors who give it there best and 1 for Brad Pitt's bum cleavage that gave the movie its best too.",0
"It seems as if this film was intended to be an intelligent film about our culture, but what it turns out to be is a mismash of guys beating each other.This film is far from entertainment, its more of punishment. Not because of the violence, but because of how absolutely STUPID it is. I caught on to what little philosophy and plot it had, and I found nothing of interest.They are trying to change society by making the people understand what their idea of society is, but what they (Pitt and Norton) dont realize is that maybe some people dont want to be changed, maybe the people actually like their life, even though their little Fight Club doesnt like it.Why must people always try to change others. People live their life the want to, maybe their not movie stars, but who really wants to be a movie star, it doesnt sound like fun to be on magazines and people taking pictures of you in your own private household. I think Fight Club missed this. It missed that not everyones the same, people are different. This is what keeps society going.This film is so full of ego's that its just sickening. As if anyone really wants to watch two men beat each other to death. This is not fun to watch. Violence can be handled in the right way in such films as Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, or Schindlers List. But Fight Club as none of the qualities of these masterpieces. Its all about two big stars beating each other and less about society.2/10",0
"I love action movies and though the filming and the fight sequences were exceptionally done, I was disappointed in this movie. The story and characters were unbelievable and it was hard to relate for any character because it was hard to find the ""Good Guy"". The entire movie glorified senseless violence, the characters were one dimensional with Brad Pitt giving perhaps his most uninspired performance of his career.  It  shouldn't surprise  anyone that this movie did so poorly at the box office after the first week.",0
"This is not a movie that would have normally raised any interest in me. However, when The Fight Club first arrived in Spain, the reviews and critiques that it received in the press where extremely negative, perhaps the worst critiques i have ever heard towards a movie. This raised my curiosity substantially, and after watching the movie, I did agree with some of the things the critics had warned about.Nevertheless, I must say that the movie begins impressively, the analytical depiction of our western culture and the lifeless void that surrounds it, with some great touches of humour, is very impressive. One cannot help but to relate to the movie, because the emptiness under which Edward Norton's character lives is something that most people in our modern day societies can really identify with; it depicts a society in which materialism and consumerism are our only sources of pleasure, from which we get short-lived doses of excitement delivered from our material purchases. The director managed to display the most average man who had a normal job, flat, decoration, etc, someone who we could see as our equal, someone on our level. The familiarity one feels towards him should really be disturbing, yet it is not, mainly because after a re-count, he is a normal, integrated, productive member of our western society. He is what is hoped for and expected from all of us.The sad thing is that the director who started a movie, which I (up to that point) would have awarded 10 of 10, ended up delivering a movie, which I rated with a 4 of 10. The beginning is excellent, but half an hour into the movie or so, it is as if the director had introduced a completely different movie. From that point on it goes from bad to worse, and turning into another typical mindless Hollywood movie, with an unnecessary level of violence and a storyline which deteriorated by the minute and a precipitated ending that delivered nothing and just fouled those magnificent initial 30 minutes.",0
"What the hell? what the hell was this movie. freakiest movie I've ever seen. I recommend seeing this at the $1.50 movie because it's worth seeing, but not payin full price.  very interesting and weird movie. City of Angels wasn't even this weird....well..maybe it was.",0
"Just like that other Brad Pitt-movie ""12 monkeys"", ""Fight club"" is so weird that it becomes hard to fully enjoy it. Both movies are considered classics, yet I fail to see why. A few years back, I thought these were truly awful but in time I learned to appreciate them a little more. Still: I simply cannot shed that feeling of disappointment and therefore, to this date, I don't consider either one of them to be as brilliant as some other classics such as for example: ""Pulp fiction"" or ""Memento""And it all started so well. The story is about a man who suffers from insomnia and desperately tries to escape his boring existence. He meets a charismatic soap salesman and starts organizing the ultimate form of excitement with him; which they call Fight Clubs. These are hidden places where normal young men fistfight each other to get rid of whatever aggravation they possess. The liberating effect of these brutal fights actually brings these men closer together and is the beginning of a very strong yet dangerous companionship.The huge plot twist of this dark and controversial movie is as unexpected as the one of ""The usual suspects"", but that doesn't mean that it is just as good. Basically: this change is so bizarre and far-fetched that it almost entirely destroys the movie for me. I simply couldn't bring myself into believing that a thing like that could actually happen. Also: looking back at everything that had transpired before, I sincerely felt that it just didn't make any sense anymore. Furthermore: I hate movies that create a beautiful truth and then tear it all apart instead of letting you enjoy it a little more. I like surprises when watching a movie, but I don't like being left empty-handed at the end of a movie. I find such dishonest endings to be a huge letdown almost every single time.The acting of the two leading men is good, but I have seen a lot better by both. Edward Norton's finest performances will most likely always be in the two-faced court drama ""Primal fear"" and the classic, shocking ""American history X"". I also like him much better in some of his other movies such as ""25th hour"" and ""The score"". Maybe his character in this film wasn't interesting enough but something about his acting didn't quite get the fullest of my attention. On the other hand: there's Brad Pitt who's acting seemed better, but even he did far more compelling stuff in ""se7en"" and ""12 monkeys"". The best acting performance in this movie however came from Helena Bonham Carter. I had never seen anything quite like this from her and she was really good. There's also Meat Loaf in the unusual role of Bob.In short: If it weren't for the obscure darkness near the end, I would probably like this movie a lot better. It certainly is a unique movie and that seemingly makes up for an interesting experience, but the weirdness of it all gets in the way at some point. I personally lost touch with this film because some things don't seem to add up here. Nevertheless: I will always recommend this movie for those who are open-minded and eager for something new.",0
I could give it a nothing if there was an option. I rate it a single star because the story and the whole movie have not impressed me at all. Disgusting!,0
"I can not understand what the fascination with this film is. All I get from this film is a bunch of guys who starts out beating each other up and then rebelling against society. And it's started by a yuppie, no less. Do they feel trapped by the conventions of society? Do they feel emasculated? If so why don't they just go to one of those caveman retreats where you dance around naked and doing primal screams, so you can connect with your ancestors and your inner caveman and spare society from your destructive urges.I have heard and read some people saying this is the greatest film they have ever seen. It makes me wonder who they identify with, is it The Narrator the guy who feels impotent by society or Tyler Durden the rebel leader who has taken a path against social convention. Personally I think both characters are among the most worthless characters I have ever seen in the Movies. Neither have any really redeeming quality. Both on the extreme side. One meek and almost helpless while the other is brash and fearless. Even when we find out the truth about the characters it really doesn't help the situation.This is a well crafted film, it looks good, crisp direction, well acted. Edward Nortons needs to be called what he is, the best actor of his generation, even better than Sean Penn in my opinion. He does a fantastic job playing the meek office drone. Even in his narration we hear a guy who seems to have little passion for his own life. Brad Pitt is very good too playing Tyler Durden. The guy is the opposite of The Narrator. He has passion but for what? to harm society? This movie has been described as subversive, a call out against societal convention. But to what? To chaos and destruction against society? Is that really much more preferable? Well like I said previously go to those caveman weekend, strip naked, yell out your primal scream and don't come back because society is better off without you.",0
"This film hasn't aged like a fine wine, rather, a stale beer. Nihilistic middle class misery porn and cod philosophising from the navel-gazing wonder children of Gen X with a ludicrously high budget - that it was due to have a Radiohead soundtrack is all the proof you could possibly need that this genuinely has nothing really to say beyond ""I'm so numb I can barely feel. BUT MAYBE THAT'S THE POINT AND HEY DON'T I LOOK COOL DOING IT?!""That being said - its entropic descent still feels convincingly gut-wrenching, there are some good performances and the glimmers of sharp meta wit make you wish it was a great deal more vibrant and fun like the big gay extravaganza it's longing to be.",0
"In my opinion, Fight Club is probably the most overrated movie in the IMDb top 30 list. The plot is unsatisfactory and the graphic violence displayed is particularly disturbing and difficult to watch. The cinematography is dark throughout and although this was obviously intended by the makers of the movie, i find it another unappealing aspect. In fact, i'm surprised that an actor of Brad Pitt's calibre chose to star in it. He is without doubt one of the best actors of his generation and has certainly done better work in his career. I always think he is at his best in more entertaining movies like Ocean's Eleven where he is superb. Definitely would not recommend this movie although i think i'm in the minority judging by the its present lofty position on the top 250 list.",0
Don't understand why such a meaningless movie got a very high rating. Not my style.,0
Soooo bad why the raitings is so good ?? The only good thing in the movie is the acting I accepted a good thing !,0
"Most of the movie was pretty boring. They tried to make a it interesting at the end, but too little to late.",0
"I've never understood the fuss about this movie basically I find it an annoying movie that is pretty much pointless in every way. I find myself avoiding it whenever it happens to be showing and couldn't bring myself to watch It a third time. I didn't enjoy Brad Pitt's performance and found it to be one of his random but similar crazy people characters like his character in 12 monkeys among other fommsbhes done the same performance in like later on in seven. Snatch was and is his best movie ever, this however is just a nonsense movie as my grandfather would have called it.",0
"This film is about how every man wants to be brad pitt.
it takes it a bit far though bc of the whole towers collapsing at the end bit. that was a bit much.
helena bone ham carter was good as bellatrix lestrange.",0
I tried to watch this movie before and couldn't finish it. I forgot why I couldn't finish and tried years later and see why again. Everything is over the top to force laughs out of you and it doesn't work on me.,0
Worst movie i have seen i dowloaded becouse high rating but its lag and not worth watching,0
"Absolute garbage. I hated it so much. I cannot believe I wasted two and a half hours on this. And I cannot believe how high it's rating it.
Someone recommended this movie to me and told me it was ""legendary"" so obviously I wanted to check it out, instant regret.
The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 is because it had its good parts. And I can see why some people might like it. But I personally think it was a waste of time.",0
This film tries too hard to copy the Big Bang theory and the classic 80s feel good movie ferris buellers day off the cast is the exact same. they should put Ryan Reynolds in this movie and then maybe it'd be a six,0
"I gave it a one, because I don't care how good and great and exceptional it was. The movie's message and the short but noticable Pepsi ads are the contrary of each other. That makes the whole movie a nonsense.",0
"It's quite long and ridiculous. The storyline is stupid. Why did everyone followed an ill man and took all his orders as if he's a god or something? How did nobody ever noticed that he's crazy? How does shooting youself in the mouth kills your alternative personality? Storyline doesn't make any sense. I'll admit this movie is very well directed tho, it has great music, acting and special effects.",0
Without concept and void movie or repetitive of previous movies,0
I love the idea of peace being brought to everyones attention in this movie. It clearly showed us how violence is always the answer. Not only this but it did an amazing job of explaining the lies of mental illness and how it's not even a real thing! Only problem while watching this movie I had was following both chararcters and how they were supposed to connect to the plot. Love this movie!,0
"Didn't understand anything of the movie.
I always sleep when it's played.",0
"I remember back in the days of VHS, a friend excitedly pushing this film into the VCR recorder and telling us how brilliant it was. ""There is a fantastic twist at the end"" Boy was he right, the twist being that I found the film as dull as watching paint dry. It was gloomy, and depressing, and nothing really happened.
All I remember was Edward Norton throwing himself around an office and Soap being melted?
Fight Club makes many top 10 film lists all over the World. I guess if it's your thing then that would explain it. For me, Fight Club was pointless.",0
"From what I know about the ""twist"", this movie is impossible: The dialogues between Norton and Pit are impossible, (most of) the physical interactions between Norton and Pit are impossible, many, if not most of the reactions from other persons to the dialogues between Norton and Pit are unrealistic and so on. It baffles me that NO ONE in this movie REALLY questions the main character(s) behavior. To me, this movie therefore was ruined by the ""twist"".Edward Norton's acting was as always great/brilliant. Brad Pit was Brad Pit, and in my eyes almost the same character as in ""Snatch"", except without the accent... Bonham Carter reminded me of Bonham Carter in ""Sweeney Tod""...If you do not know why the whole premise for this movie is impossible, or if you do not care, or if you do not understand, or if you do not care that this movie is the equivalent of the emperor's new clothes, then you might like this movie! To me it is a school book in form over function: It looks good, but it does not contain anything substantial!",0
The biggest problems with this movie is that it is not interesting in a pseudo-intellectual sort of way and that it does not impart the viewer with anything.,0
It's a good movie nothing mind blowing .Some stuff makes no sense at all anyone trying to tell you different probably thinks their smarter than you...but their not.My real rating would probably be 7 but since the rating on IMDB is overrated i'll give it a 4,0
"No logical concept... No discipline.... No any sense..
Theres nothing without mess... my 2 hours just ruin.. theres no drama, no thrills ,nothing... Its just a kids nightmare.. 1st 30 min seems some interesting but then what was that??? Just gave 5 stars for 2 actors .",0
My best friend in high school joined a fight club. He is now in jail for assault. Fight clubs are bad and you should NEVER join them! The movie was great. 5/5 stars.,0
"I saw the movie it was okay, I wish they would make movies that don't repeat over and over same plots.",0
"The film is so highly acclaimed so I thought it would be a good viewing experience but I was wrong.The first act of the film is really strong, Edward Norton gives a terrific performance and it's interesting to watch the characters insomnia play out. I love the subtle hints given towards the final twist of Norton being Tyler Durdon.
Yet Brad Pitt's introduction is where the film becomes dull, First I want to say that Brad Pitt is great in this but his character isnt.
We are expected to believe that Edward Norton assembled a devoted cult by beating himself up, that he has knowledge of explosives despite not having any known explosives background. There is a scene in the film where Edward Norton walks past Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter having sex and since Norton and Pitt are the same person it makes no sense how he can be in two places at once.
The Third act gets better but has some problems, mainly that despite Norton now knowing that he is Tyler Durdon, he still allows himself to beat up himself. Edward Norton even survives the most unrealistic suicide attempt, although I love the very end scene with the building blowing up, mainly because of the song.Overall, this film is given too much credit and acclaim for something that isn't worth it. David Fincher has proven he can do better with his film Se7en, this was more alike to Alien3.",0
Really even a single moment not captured my mind whether am not fit for those movies may be that would be the reason not getting through it,0
"Like a bro comedy, with less comedy and more bro, bro!I had this film recommended to me (and quoted) so many times, that I'd begun to think it really must contain some life changing pearls of wisdom. I eventually decided to watch it. Well at least forty minutes or so of it.The beginning was very intriguing actually. The cynical observations of the protagonist, regarding himself and the cookie cutter life others like him so often fall into, were an intelligent critique of consumerism and materism, if not stale already by now. Perhaps it was more novel at the time the film was released. David Fincher's directorial style probably had something to do with how it felt like it was going to be a ""cool"" movie. The fact that Brad Pitt was in it promised the same. I started to fall for it, yet things turned downwards not long after Brad Pitt's character was introduced.I felt like I'd been swindled. I feel like people who like this movie have been swindled, like someone snapped their fingers and strobed some lights and said, ""You will now appreciate the following film"". Or maybe ...the things I dislike about the movie are exactly what people like about it. I don't know. It seemed like a joke to me how the movie poses as cerebral and intellectual in the first ""act"" so to speak but then gravitates towards gratuitous testosterone cult indoctrination that can be found in any other random action flick. Except this one has Brad Pitt, oooh, star power! And Brad Pitt's character is no philanthropist. He charms his way into the protagonists life and begins to influence him, acts like he possesses the Tao of life, after revealing to him that some of his antisocial hobbies are: inserting pornographic material in the reels of (non R rated) films while working as a movie projector (scene of little girl's crying reaction to giant cock in movie theater is supposed to be humorous), and urinating/spitting/ejaculating into strangers' food while working in the kitchen of an upscale restaurant. Stuff we should all look up to, for sure. I really hope people watching this don't actually think Brad Pitt's character is someone who they'd like to be, but no doubt, many probably do, because the film makes him into almost a patriarchal, however rebellious, figure. Though it's not a true rebellion, because the world is full of tough guys and cowboys and punks who just don't give a fuck, there is absolutely nothing new about it.So, after criticizing the conformity of men who adopt a life of working in suits and acquiring fancy stuff that advertisements insist they need, the prescription is a new kind of conformity - the old fashion macho male stereotype kind. In other words, don't be a workaholic, don't care about wealth or belongings, care about brute physical strength and drawing some blood! Grrrr, yeah! That's what life is all about! The protoganist forgoes the group therapy he was addicted to previously, in favor of a new group, and a new kind of therapy: he is so desperate to be able to feel something that he needs to get punched in the face, apparently. Sounds like somebody has issues. Good luck with that. I could not bare to sit through the entire thing. It's a pseudo-intellectual, gender-stereotypical, chest-beating outting aimed at an audience of young men who need something a little more than UFC - overanalyzing the mildly philosophical moments so they can pretend they weren't just under hypnosis from the adrenaline rush they get watching fight scenes. After all, it's named fight club, not think club.",0
"Everyone loves this film. I can see why, the first time I watched it I thought I loved it, but everytime I watch it, it gets significantly worse. Ok, the twist is stupid, spoilers they are the same person but that doesn't make sense because in the rest of the film they have conversations in public with people around them but it's just one guy talking to himself . I would understand it if people looked strangely at them as it would show something was up but they don't it's just lazy, not much smart is done to set up the twist yeah they do that whole thing that Tyler durden says to not talk to Marla about him but that's it the twist just happens and makes no sense, then he shoots himself in the cheek which kills Tyler. COME ON! That makes no sense why couldn't he just die. Ok I quite like the message but it is made redundant when the film has whorish product placement that just undermines the whole message. I don't like the fact that the film starts with the most interesting part, I find that a bit lazy. Helena Bonham Carter horribly overacts. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are fine nothing special and David Fincher does a good job directing, i like the tone and colour palette. I think the film looks nice. However the more I think about all the dumb shit and the dull monologue it just gets worse and worse",0
"You have Norton, a guy who was born to be in intense movies and you have Pitt, this guy taught himself to act over the years, so the ability for a great movie is there, I will not argue that.When I found out they were the same person I had to really hunker in to try and let myself appreciate the movie. It was not easy.I know that if one is a movie watcher one should let go of the realistic. I get this lecture all the time when I say something from a movie is just not believable. ""It's a movie, it's not real."" But, for me when something in a movie doesn't make sense, it can be just as bad as a cell phone going off in the theater. I can't just let it go.Here is what bugs the dooty out of me. You have to realize that the group of people - other than Pitt and Norton - had to watch some guy punching himself in the face, and say to themselves, ""Hey, I want to be a part of that. I want to hang out with that guy."" It lost me.",0
i liked this movie but id was a little confused it's about a guy with Schizophrenia and he makes up this character called Tyler and starts beating him self up.then he gets in to a seller of some bar with a lot lode of guys and starts a underground fight club then he moves in to a crappy hose with his imaginary friend and imagines him having sex with some women and in the end he shot his imaginary friend out of his head and does not die WTF..... .... ....... .... ..... ........ ........ ......... .... . . .... ..... . ..... .... ... ........ ...... ........ ....... .... . ....... . ... . ....... . ........ . .... .. ....... ... . ... ..... ...... ... ....... .... ... ..... ... ..... ... .............. .,0
"Pros: i) A few really smart lines here and there ii) Excellent actingCons: i) The only way the guy found to ""rebel"", was through boxing and sex. Nothing good, just release.ii) The movie doesn't give you a good break once in a while - it's dark throughout, and portrays men as either inherently violent leaders, or inherently violent soldiers. The protagonist is a very limited personality, only one in a hundred thousand could identify even by half. An over-inflated ego that finds his alter ego as a ""charming, highly sexual gangster"". Big ... deal.Conclusion: if you hate your corporate office and your IKEA furniture, you can move to Alabama or North Dakota, no need to become a gangster.",0
"This movie seems geared for the male over 13 crowd. It has quite a bit of violence in the money Others may think it makes statements. It does. It seems anti establishment. I can get that listening to my son as his teenage years fly by. I don't believe that it has much, if any, redemptive value. We all at some time want to rebel against the world. We all want to knock someone off their block. However, most of us don't and we learn to accept the world and rules of the world. I was surprised to see Brad Pitt in this movie. I guess we all need part time work somewhere and at sometime. This film has a very small amount of entertaining value. Use your time wiser, watch something else.",0
"Let me get this out & clear that I LOVE ""Reservoir Dogs"" and am NOT against violence in movies OR in for ""Stories with Morals"". BUT I am also the average ""Joe"" portrayed by Ed Norton, and I will NOT set my Condo on fire to ""get out"" of the rut that is my life as I am sure any average Joe wouldn't do. We, after all, don't get the title to wreck it, right? The movie is not bad in that it's terribly impossible to miss. Now if the plot flies three feet above your head is something different but hold judgment as there definitely is a very specific plot.First , the movie comes out at a time of relative peace and financial stability , then it talks about war , terrorism , corporations and yes buildings being bombed. Yes , that happens too , all before it happens in real life. Average Joes are lured into fights , then oppression, then vandalism and we the audience are told that ""Fights"" are a way to fight, forgive me , Cancer? Brad Pitt looks as good as the devil himself. He also, encompasses the part of our mind that is ""trapped"" behind morals.The same part that we are taught to ""keep in check"". He tells us we need to ""lose control"". Before he takes in Ed Norton , he asks him to ""Hit me"" and there they go. Watching the movie unfold is like watching McDonald's sell their latest ""Spicy"" burger against the tight resolves of someone trying to cut weight.Overall my insides cringe at the aftermath of ""Fight Club"". The violence, gore, subliminal messages, the timing and some tight and neat slaps on the face of faith make this movie the best advertisement of a very well thought agenda. For setting the stage for a perpetual violence that has engulfed our world in the last 11 years or so since it's release and for selling violence and hate dressed as the irresistible Mr.Pitt, and for admitting sexuality is ingrained in the minds of children through subliminal messages, I also term it as the A-rated porn produced by Hollywood, which would force you to strip off your common sense and good judgment, rather than your clothes. And that has already happened! Let's not forget that a big majority of audiences DO NOT remember that good defeated evil in a movie.They only remember how powerful or slick or funny or smart the evil was. Or they would only remember the character that had those traits in the movie. And in a movie like ""Fight Club"" even the good guy doesn't remember if he is the good guy or if he is the bad guy. All he remembers , over and over again is ""Tyler Durden"" this name is repeated more than Ed's own name and as I write this , I have also forgotten what was the name of Ed Nortorn's character? So what are the odds people would remember the good from bad,the terrorists from Cancer patients, the average Joe from Tyler Durden?If you don't wanna go in that direction, the ""MOVIE"" as a product is awesome. The performances are powerful to say the least and as beautiful as Brad Pitt is, the whole thing belongs to Edward Norton, such a fine, fine actor that he is.Though I still cringe at the blatancy of it all.",0
"When Fight Club was released ...ahem... bestowed upon a generation so eager to see the lack of meaning in their lives, it felt like a veritable cinematic gift. And who was most eager to receive that gift? Frat boys! Meat heads! Athletic uber-tools! Confused males with no idea what to do with their testosterone or intelects could give a collective and resounding ""I get it!"" after declaring that this was their favorite film. And there was nothing wrong with that because this was not a disposable Michael Bay juggernaut of ejaculate. It wasn't even a Tarantino powerhouse of poised pulp! No, this movie was challenging! Unfortunately, as much as society's chode children loved it, they didn't get the message. They didn't get it like the anti-establiSHAM grim and grime enthusiasts got it. You see, there is a truly provocative, truly subversive message to this film that just sweats insight and bleeds truth. That message? Life is not Disneyland, people! Oh no! You thought life was sunny and fun? Get off your Donny Osmond douvee and stop drinking that Yoohoo! Life is a dark, bleak, damp mess and everything that doesn't come from IKEA smells like fecal matter. Fight Club shows us that in this day and age, life is so terminally f***t that finding a support group without a voluptuous obese man is as likely as buying soap that isn't made from human fat. Fat Club ...ahem... Fight Club shows us that in this world, the only truth you'll find is the truth behind a punch to the face ...or the truth between Meat Loaf's mammaries. Never before or since has there been a film that so effectively told us that our lives had no meaning. Except for maybe Twilight! Keep up the good fist, Fight Clubbers!",0
"There are three main characters in this film. Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden, who is Edward Norton's imaginary being. Edward Norton plays the narrator and has no real name due to he is really Tyler but doesn't really think so. Helena Bonham Carter plays Marla Singer. She meets Norton's character at addiction meetings and help groups. She is sleeping with Brad Pitt's character of Tyler Durden, but in the end, we find out she has really been sleeping with Norton's character. The only character's name that could give something away would be Edward Norton's character due to him not even having a name; they just call him the narrator. Brat Pitt's character always looks nice after a fight, like it didn't even happen, and that is how most girls imagine an attractive man to look like. Edward Norton's character always looks tired, run-down, and like he doesn't care about anything. Carter's character Marla looks crazy. Her hair is always messed up, as well as her make-up.The setting is mysterious and dark. It takes place in a city, but the viewers are never given a specific city, which lets them know that a fight club could be started anywhere. The mood of the film was depressing and gives off the feeling that no one cares about anything you do, and everyone's lives suck. I feel the setting and mood make Norton's character show his true colors. There are a lot of crime looking areas and run down places in the film and it could be foreshadowing how Norton's character is feeling inside. The point-of-view is the narrator, Edward Norton. Imagery I took from the film was the way Brad Pitt and Edward Norton looked. Pitt's character always was in great shape while Norton's character always looked worn out. Pitt's character is the typical standard for women of what a man should look like, and Norton's character is the typical crazy looking person people imagine. The camera angles in the film show you who is talking and, in a way, from whose point-of-view we are in at the time. In a few scenes, Norton's character breaks the fourth wall when he looks directly into the camera and talks to the audience. The music is music directors put in to add suspense and to let the viewer know when something big or important is going to happen. The movie ""Fight Club"" was an interesting and confusing movie. There were many twists in the plot that kept me watching and trying to figure out what was going to happen next. This movie gives viewers an insight into what it's like to have a mental health problem like Edward Norton's character has in the film. Overall it was a good film because it kept you watching and intrigued by everything that was going on.",0
"No metro-sexual pansies need apply. Take this to heart. The world is drowning in boys. Testosterone testosterone everywhere yet not a man in sight. Fight Club is an eloquent commentary on man's pathetic decline. Superbly written, it screams in your face, and makes you sit up and take notice. Yet... it offers nothing more than wet dreams and the fantasies of what it means to be a man. Long dead is the Duke. Long dead is the strong, capable man. In the end, Fight Club is nothing more than a flimsy gossamer veil that's meant to hide the ugliness of the collective male ego - so easily bruised - so easily controlled. It has become a phenomenon - a pseudo identity that weak men cling to in the hopes of seeing something more in the mirror - but it's a lie. Bedding a crazy broad, punching it out with yourself in the basement, blowing your life to hell - is this truly what makes a man?",0
"So It's been 12 years since this movie came out, and I've finally gotten around to watching it. Given I was seven when it came out so the content would've been unsuitable. Still I've heard for years how good this movie, heard all the memorable quotes, everything that sort of surrounds a cult film like this. So I can't begin to tell you how disappointing this film is. One thing to remember before watching the film is that it's not about fighting, so don't even expect a few cheap thrills from the action, cause the fisticuffs are short, few, and far between. Yeah it's a metaphor for the male role in modern society, what a rip off.It's crap masquerading as intellectual, and important, but really it's just burying itself in grit and violence, and tricking you all into thinking it's a smart film, just because it's dark and misanthropic nature. Don't get me wrong a dark and gritty film can be excellent, however Fight Club doesn't deliver anything but sloppy, bloody punches. It's well shot, and the acting is good, but it's just completely devoid of entertainment. Setting aside the fact that it's one of the most depressing films I've had the displeasure of seeing, where 90% of the dialogue is Norton whining about his petty problems, and then going about like a total ponce and faking real problems to get attention. Somehow I'm supposed to care about this character? He's a douche, an unsympathetic, pathetic, boring douche, not the everyman that this movie thinks he is. The protagonist isn't this film's only flaw, it's arrogant, and pretentious, and has this twisted view of the world which it has deluded itself into believing everyone else shares.In short this is a popular film, and you will probably like it more than me, especially if you've got a taste for the realistic and seedier side of film making, but please don't just be like swarms of other people and actually view this film objectively, rather than just going in and getting psyched because of it's cult status, and basically tricking yourself into thinking you like it. It's a movie that tries to make you think, but unfortunately few do, please think about the content. Now I just wish that my first IMDb review weren't a negative one.",0
"Fight Club is frantic and difficult to watch at the best of times. I understand the message, we live in a consumer driven society and Jack and Tyler set up the ""Fight Club"" in rejection to it. Interesting, but the film's execution is messy and in the end I was less enthralled but more glad that it was over.The film uses excessive violence because it can. It adds little meaning to what's being presented here....and I'm still unsure of what Fincher is trying to present in the first place. In any case the violence does not progress the story, it is unbearable as it is presented as almost having healing qualities.I was indifferent to the character of Jack, as he has no appealing qualities. I was unsure of whether to find the idea of his refuge in cancer and tuberculosis groups interesting or sickening. The audience are expected to accept this, along with the other strange actions of Jack and Tyler. To be fair, they were good performances, though I have severe gripes with the characters.It is safe to say I did not 'get' Fight Club. I do not 'get' how one would consider this a masterpiece of modern cinema. I admit that my enjoyment did suffer to the fact that the twist was ruined for me before I saw it. Still considering this I was underwhelmed. I can't really say skip it as it has a huge fan base and I wonder whether I do not know what I am talking about. You may enjoy it. I did not.",0
"It's difficult to write a review for this movie without spoilers, but I'm gonna to do it to save some of you from wasting your time. Man is this movie overrated! I'm a 30-year-old guy who likes all kinds of movies, but I'd rather watch Ed Norton on The Honeymooners than this garbage. We have Ed Norton as a white-collar worker who just up-and-decides he doesn't like 'commercialism/monetary system $$$' or whatever anymore. So he befriends Brad Pitt, who's a rebellious fighter type. They start a fight club. It gets so big....anyway what ends up happening is just totally unbelievable and ridiculous. That's the first 3/4 of the movie. Now for the ending. The writer/director tries a few surprises, and I've read reviews saying how great it was. Trust me, it's not clever. It's a little surprising, but not much. I've seen endings done much much better. The worst part is it's just totally pointless. Didn't inspire me at all. Or make me think. Same with the relationship with the girl - pointless. Basically just a waste of time.",0
"When I started watching this movie I thought that this movie would touch me in any way possible and I believe it did. I didn't even know what was happening as the ending started to close in. In the beginning and in the middle, the fight scenes and the (WOW) sex scenes made me give this movie a 4/10. I saw nothing in this movie in the end it just is very confusing. I mean the isn't Tyler Durton but he is!!! I mean that ending just destroyed this movie for me and if I were you I really would not waste 2 and 7 minutes watching this movie. The only reason why I gave this movie a 4 is the fight scence and the sex scence that is it. If the ending and the explanation of Brad Pitt's disappearnce had been explained a bit more reallistically I believe that this movie deserved at least an 8!",0
"I won't say much about this film except if you like the drama and depth of Ultimate Fighting, then this film is for you.If you can't stand watching good actors, with bad dialog and a script that seems to not really make much of a point then stay away! I think the rating must be skewed because those that were attracted to the topic watched it and those that were not never considered it.Ebert's review was pretty spot-on. ""The Game"" and ""Se7en"" are far better films from the same director that actually have a plot and good dialog. Heck why not rent ""A Clockwork Orange"" which deals with the topic of violence in a far more interesting fashion and if uncut makes this ""Fight Club"" look like a children's story.That this film is ahead of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or even worse ""Citizen Kane"" shows just how well the process of dumbing down the audience is working. And people wonder why Hollywood makes so few good movies with depth.",0
"What can I say about Fight Club? Technically it is one of the most well-crafted movies ever made with brilliant direction, superb acting, bravura cinematography and terrific editing. Music by the Dust Brothers maintains the overall surreal ambiance of the passages to which they are set (see the scoring of the segment where the Fight Clubbers try to pick fights with innocent people for a good example) and the writing and characterization are far more insightful than the average shocker. Every character is developed well enough for us to either identify with them or at least understand them. There is a lot of unusually ingenious creativity evident in certain scenes such as the IKEA catalog scene, the opening zoom through a brain sequence, the support group scenes, the use of a subjective voice over and non linear chronology.That's where the pluses end. Now for the minuses. The movie depicts men in their 20s and 30s who regain their masculinity by beating up/getting beaten up by other men. Once they regain their masculinity, they rebel against society by destroying the capitalistic /consumeristic society that has enslaved them for so long. That entails carrying out destructive and loathsome acts of vandalism against society. If you want to re attain your masculinity even if it means killing yourself, then go hurt yourself. Why terrorize innocent people in society who don't share your concerns and probably wont feel the same way you do? Splicing porn stills into children's films and spiking food with bodily fluids might seem downright funny to some, but it is simply vile, repellent and morally repugnant. Some people will even find making soap out of human fat positively revolting. Yet the cleverness with which all this is lensed will make some people want to imitate some of these pranks.Many of the dangerous ideas may actually sound deep and thought-provoking but some of them are just inversions of the Truth. For instance, all true Christians know that our corporate, materialistic world sells us a lie when it says we need our favorite McDonald meal to be happy or we aren't somebody if we don't have a good bank balance or the latest car. Fight Club knows this truth and perverts it. It also perverts the beautiful ideal of masculinity suggesting that if you do not have scars or injuries from dangerous beatings, you are not man enough. At least movies like Die Hard and the LOTR series celebrated masculinity in the proper moral context, with the protagonists flexing their muscles to protect and defend innocent people.An argument could be successfully constructed that this movie doesn't glorify its violence and nihilism rather it is a deconstruction of it as evidenced by the hero's futile attempts near the end to stop the mass destruction from taking place. The subtlety of the movie's last-act rebuttal to its anarchistic themes completely escaped me as I felt that this movie was nothing more than an apologetic for its one evil character's nihilistic philosophies.The eerily prescient image of the credit card buildings collapsing serves as a tight ruler slap to the wrists of all those who cheered during the destruction scenes of Independence Day and Armageddon. I never cheered during all those pyrotechnics so clearly I am not among the members of the audience this sharp satirical barb is aimed at. I am looking for the movie or movies that correctly satirize capitalism, materialism and the feminization of masculinity in developed societies, but Fight Club is not that film. I still remember finishing the screening of this film, feeling equal parts amazed and horrified. Amazed to see so much creativity in one single film and horrified at the possible real-world implications of what I had just seen.My rating:***** out of **********.Artistic Value:***** out of *****. Moral/Spiritual Value: 0 out of *****.",0
"It's either this or Casablanca or Donnie Darko as the most overrated American film ever, and just behind Donnie Darko as the most pretentious. I had heard about the cult status of this film, and the book it was based on, years before I saw it, though what little of the plot I knew about didn't make it seem terribly interesting. Sure enough, it wasn't.This movie gives pretentiousness an even worse name than it already had. It has the anarchic nihilism of an old Etonian in a punk outfit, the laughs of a Bob Hope routine, the outrageous pranks of South Park's Captain Kaos, the acting subtlety of an amateur pantomime, the philosophical depth of a fortune cookie, and the coherence of a William S. Burroughs cutup.And then there's the ""plot"". It seems to consist of a number of separate unrelated ideas which are strung together into what is supposed to be a story, but with no obvious attempt at logical integration. A man is dissatisfied with his humdrum life. So of course he attends group therapy sessions for conditions he doesn't have. Then he meets his alter ego, Tyler Durden, who of course devotes his life to pulling unfunny satirical pranks. Then, naturally, they start fistfights with each other up for thrills. Witnesses see the obvious appeal of these fistfights and start joining in to form a secret nationwide movement. The movement understandably turns into an anti-consumerist terrorist cult financed by selling home-made soap. Finally Tyler Durden is revealed to be the protagonist's alternative personality whom the protagonist starts to fear and dislike, so he kills off his imaginary friend by shooting himself in the head, while managing to survive the injury himself. I kid you not, that is this film's pathetic excuse for a plot. Perhaps this is really just a clever satirical comment on the arbitrary nonsensical plots of Hollywood action movies. But that wouldn't make it any less lame.As if this nonsensical plot isn't tedious enough, the film-makers drag out its exposition, so that it has the length and pace of an Antonioni movie, despite the relentless action. It feels even longer than its already excessive 2 hours plus.I only rated it 3/10 because I have seen worse movies that I still gave 2/10. It probably deserves less. I realise that many somehow think this film is amazing. If so, it only proves that we have created a future where everything is amazing for 15 minutes.",0
"I gathered from some sources that this is one of the movies that people like. So I rented it, watched it.It begins with a man narrating his story with some witty lines, but in a very monotonous voice. The movie starts with this man having a life which follows a set routine. However, soon it turns out that this life turns into a whole journey of unconventional and out of the ordinary events, and a wild life which this man seems to like better. However, too many things happen and that gives an effect of a missing flow in the movie.The major twist that comes at the end is unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean that it is unbelievably good. I just mean that - unbelievable. It is like after having done with the whole movie, they had to put some twist - so they put something totally bizarre. And that leaves the movie with lots of holes. It does not explain, for example how the narrator knows how to make bombs, or soap for that matter.And god only knows, why all those men were following Brad Pitt's vandalism team (I say vandalism team, but it has been referred to as a terrorism group in the movie. You judge.) Was the team imaginary too?Also I never found the reason why they would like to flash a picture of a man's penis once or twice in the middle of the movie. The fact that it doesn't serve any purpose makes it one more reason to make the movie distasteful for me.The conclusion of this movie seemed to me as a very pathetic attempt to create a twist. In my opinion, even if they had a conclusion like one of the characters was an alien from another planet, that would still have been more interesting and more realistic than this amateur 'twist'. Not sure which part of the movie is exactly so good that some people have given it a 'cult' status.If you like this, then perhaps you haven't seen A Beautiful Mind, or The Sixth Sense yet. They will blow you off.",0
"Thanks for the facts and summary, but i'm more interested as to how the structure of his film affects the content or meaning of the 'story'. Why is it told in a narrative's POV? would it alter the story if structured otherwise? Why is the time line formed in this way and what purpose does it serve to us the viewers? How does the telling (in chronological or vice versa) of the story affect my point of view about the main characters in the movie? I'm more interested in the formal structure of this film to have a better appreciation for its artistry. Everyone has their own interpretation of the movie-I'd just like to know ""why?""",0
"I find this film hard to watch, not because of the violence, but rather I don't really care about the characters to want to keep my eyes on the screen and found myself looking at something else more interesting half the time. All I can think of when I do watch is - ""Why?"".Of course it became clear why towards the end. And it is also clear to me that the film relies on the boys' fascination with violence to keep the film going until the ending when you can see what is happening, at which point it actually got quite thrilling. Otherwise there isn't really anything that is very interesting, just a middle class boys' fantasy of a more exciting existence while living their own very comfortable but dull lives. It's for boys who get stuck in this contradictory existence - hating the good life they have, wanting to destroy it but in truth will never give up their comfortable lifestyle. It's as stupid and as childish as the insertion of naughty bits into the film.It is for the ending that it got higher vote that it did, nothing much else to recommend it otherwise.",0
"Fight Club is not a bad movie, per se, but it really does not deserve all the credit that is given to it for being such an awesome movie. It started out fine, I was enjoying myself, well, not necessarily enjoying it, but I liked that it was mentally stimulating - I can respect that about Fight Club. But then the movie just turned....weird. The idea of these characters being part of an underground fight club was not a bad idea, but what the filmmakers did with it might have been. There was a book written about it, and the book focuses much more on the psychological aspect of all that is going on. Obviously, Fight Club is also a very intensely psychological film, but it doesn't seem to entirely know what it is doing with this.It is a movie with no particular teaching in mind or direction in its step. It is a movie in which the director, through intertwining suspense, violence and dialogue, tries to pound into the viewer some sort of questioning or some sort of thing to make us think. Unfortunately, because of the director's attempt to make the viewer ask questions, what comes onto the screen is a jumble of jargon, the focal point of which is the fighting, not the psychological aspects. Occasional mention of sex is thrown in liberally, and somehow made to fit into the plot line, but on the whole it seems kind of useless. The movie to me was just confusing and really not that great. Like I said, it's not a bad film, it just isn't all that.I like plot twists in movies, and the plot twist in Fight Club wasn't all that bad. In fact, it might have made the movie. But there were several factors that didn't work for me. One was the way the plot twist seemed just kind of tossed in there. I mean, obviously, it is integral to the whole story, but I could tell that if the entire storyline was looked at completely intensely, every piece would not fit into place. In the Sixth Sense, every last piece fit perfectly. In Fight Club, it obviously didn't. Also, the ending of the movie kind of spoiled the whole thing for me. The guy shoots himself in the mouth, stays alive for several minutes afterward, and everything continues on as it was going too, except for the fact that Edward Norton's character is going to die. What the heck!? The entire movie just seems confusing for the sake of being confusing. It believes that if a movie is thought-provoking, it is automatically classified as good. That is not necessarily true. I could take a bucket of truth and have characters in a movie speak several twisted versions of it, toss it into a setting, a story, and a climax, and call it a movie, but that doesn't mean it's good. Too much of Fight Club seems like this. Yes, it is very thought-provoking. My thoughts were provoked. Yet there is something integral missing, that piece of movie-making that makes other movies good, and the lack of it leaves Fight Club somewhere in that place between a strange movie and a great movie.",0
"Upon seeing the film a second time, the big picture became clearer. I was told by a friend to rent the film again and watch it until the end, because I walked out of the first viewing half way through and I ""missed the whole point."" The film does make a poignant statement, albeit in a very graphic manner.Honestly I don't care how clever it is, that level of violence is absolutely and completely gratuitous despite all the claims to the contrary. I'm not a prude; I loved Scarface, Blow, Full Metal Jacket, etc. The violence in those films rose to the level that supported and enhanced the plots. Not only did the violence in Fight Club exceed what was necessary to get the point across, it exceeded the threshold of what most people can tolerate. I know some will say that's the point, but I disagree. The violence is nearly pornographic. How anyone has the stomach to get through this movie is beyond me. Not because it's a bad movie, but because it perverts what it could have done more subtly.",0
"""Fight Club"" is difficult to watch. It is filled with violence for violence sake without any redeeming qualities. Norton is a youth looking for a change of life style at an early age. Pitt plays a vulgar young man with pure violence on his mind. He infects his contacts with the same concept of life. Scene after scene is filled with blood and gore. Most of the violent behavior is purely hand to hand combat as in real boxing. If the author meant for us to be turned off by the physicality, then he has succeeded. The pace is frenetic, and the acting is just as fast. I could not give this cinema a high score simply because of the dark, depressing mood it exudes without projecting some sort of uplifting characteristic's.",0
"Though this film does not work for me. A film based on violence does not appease me. Edward Norton excellent, Brad Pitt more or less suffrable, and Helena Bonham-Carter totally miscast. I wish she would come back to real films made in the UK. She seems to have been stuck into this one rather as a decorative piece, a bit of girl in an overstretched `macho' display, which, ultimately, does not convince. It is that embedded American tendency to go over the top in exaggerated play-offs, whether action or dialogue, that is so off-putting. If you like seeing people go off the rails, if you like to see naked debauchery, here you have it.",0
"Here's a movie that pretends to condemn violence (by the end, Tyler Durden is unmistakeably a villain), but it makes fighting look so cool that thousands of people have misinterpreted its message.  Maybe I'm being too harsh here; I've met two people who were inspired to start random fights because of this movie, and that really irritates me (especially since they took pokes at me!).  However, I do think that a fatally flawed message is enough to sink a film, even a great film, and this is not quite a great film.Oh yeah, there's social commentary in this movie...commentary for angry 15 year olds.  Okay, commercial society stinks, so we should rebel, we should reform popular culture by...by...going to the basement and punching each other out?  No, that doesn't strike me as a viable solution.  Even the movie knows this, and it does some quick back-pedaling at the end and tells us not to trust Durden...but he's been the hero all along!   
So, in the end, the film points out problems but offers no solutions.  It generates anger, but channels it in the wrong direction.  It's clever, but it's not actually smart.  It's satirical, but it doesn't have a point. Violence is good, until it kills Meatloaf, and then violence is bad.  Sorry, it doesn't work.As for the film's actual style...gross, innit?  So, I ask myself - why watch a gross movie with a flawed message?  Good question.  The answer is, don't watch it, and go find an actually good, actually wise movie instead.",0
"All I can say, is that if anyone who watches this, and finds some meaning to it, or meaning to their life, or inspiration somehow, your lives must be pretty shytty. Some of the scenes are just pure BS, Norton's fight with himself, getting dragged through the parking lot, the final scene, what the freak was that. Yes, some serious questions are raised about the decay of our society, the meaningless of our lives (well at least some of our lives), the quirky group support scenes are funny, and even touching in a strange way, but the whole creation and coming together or divergence of Norton's personalities is just too unbelievable. What was also freaky was Norton playing the Primal fear role, and Brad Pitt doing his 12 monkeys thing, too much deja vu there for me. If you were impressed by Norton beating himself up in front of his boss, then you need to see the old 'Class of '84' , where a punk teen does the same thing with similar effect. If you want to see a great movie, an indictment on today's society, something which may touch you, and maybe make you look a lot deeper at yourself, check out 'Falling Down' starring Michael Douglas.On the plus side, this is a great performance by Edward Norton. This is a brilliant actor, and a joy to watch and experience 5/10",0
"Oh, wait! Is it over yet? An over-hyped piece of testosterone crap. Great performances, but too bad the script drags the performances down with it. My favorite part about this whole overrated movie is that IMDB users have this ranked as a better piece of filmmaking than ""Raging Bull,"" ""Sunset Blvd,"" ""Jaws,"" ""On the Waterfront,"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" Wow... has anyone here seen a movie that came out before ""Star Wars?""",0
"Boy, did I ever hear and read raves about this film, so I had to see it for myself. Although it succeeded in keeping me interested, I was fairly disappointed with it. I didn't empathize with a single character, and somehow I found it very unclear what the appeal of the fight club itself was. As a result, the cult that builds later in the film seems pretty absurd since the basis for it was so poorly explained. What's more, are we as viewers supposed to be able to identify with Edward Norton's character because he seems to have some conscience and a hint (however small) of normalcy?  Not only didn't I understand where he was coming from (until the end), I didn't really care. I would give this film a score of 5 out of 10, because it had some good performances (namely Norton) despite not having much to work with in terms of script, and because it did keep me interested. I find it laughable that this film is trying to come off as art, though..",0
"Something about this film just doesn't fit.  **MAY ALLUDE TO SPOILER**  It was a very nice story, and a nice try, but it just didn't fit.  I had figured out the secret about halfway through, but I still can't figure out how I got there.  It just doesn't piece together.Another problem with this film, is that the characters were so unbelievable, so disgusting, that I could not relate to a single one of them, therefore missing out on the very important Protagonist/Antagonist concept of filmmaking.  I also could not understand how the concept of men beating the life out of one another, then standing up shaking hands, then coming back the next day for more was even remotely believable.However, what I did like about this film was the filming and production itself.  I thought that the shots were outstanding, and the use of light vs. dark techniques were beautifully shot.  The overall production was the basis for my giving this film a 5.  Other than that, the story just doesn't cut it.",0
"The great acting of Pitt and Norton and the top-notch visual stylings of director David Fincher cannot overcome the juvenile and absurd story of FIGHT CLUB.  Fincher has remarked that his film is anti-violent, and there is certainly some validity to that.  However, he seems to be having too much fun filming this overwrought film of two men trying to return to their masculine roots by having a series of fistfights with neighboring men. Some of the first half is fairly interesting and definitely puts a spotlight on the sadness of men who  find they may have lost an aspect of their soul. However when the whole thing starts this cult-like following of epic-proportions and an idiotic last 45 minutes keeps you scratching your head, the film simply ends up being ridiculous.  Want to see director Fincher really shine rent THE GAME with Michael Douglas or SEVEN with Pitt and Morgan Freeman.  Also want to see this same story told much better rent Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.",0
"Halfway through the movie I thought I had enough of Brad Pitt playing philosopher, but fortunately, events took an interesting turn. The movie would be far better it it were pure fights and psychiatry without pretense of deep thoughts.",0
"This movie was interesting because it tried to make a physical struggle out of the main character's mental struggle. The only problem with this is that looking back you realize too many inconsistancies, although a mediocre attempt was made to cover this up.  I also thought that the ""moment of realization"" in the movie wasn't as quite as shocking as others because the movie gives way too many clues.",0
"The film is very well made, with inventive directorial touches that actually help rather than hinder: such as the bit about adding subliminal porn, and the 180 degree quick pan, done vertically rather than horizontally.  In this 140 minute film, after the big plot twist occurs, there is not nearly enough remaining time to explore the resulting situation (but that would be a different movie).  The problem is that the film is unremittingly gruesome and at times, physically unpleasant.  I wouldn't want to watch this again, not because it is a bad film, but basically because I hated it.",0
"Wildly original and intriguing. Pitt and Norton are excellent. It was on the way to being one of the best pictures the year, then it lost everything in the final 25 minutes. I don't know why they had to twist the end of the story like that...very disappointing, considering how good the first hour and a half were.",0
"I came, I saw, but I was definitely not conquered by the critical raves this film has been receiving.  While there is much to admire in terms of acting (consistently high all-round) and art direction, two aspects of the film left me feeling down-for-the-count.First is the omnipresent voice-over narration.  Admittedly, I am not a fan of this type of narrative short-cut, but in this instance, it was used liberally through-out and unnecessarily 90% of the time.Second was the jaw-dropping plot twist, which I will not give away.  A fine issue film was turned into a ridiculous metaphysical thriller and at this point, I lost interest.",0
"I had high hopes for this film.  I have liked Fincher's previous films, The Game and Seven.  I did like the humor in the film.  Helen Bonham Carter's role was a nothing role.  I think Fincher was trying to say to people to think for themselves and break free of this rampant commercialism.  His message gets lost with all the pummeling that takes place in the film.  I don't know of anyone who would want to take a beating on a consistent basis. This movie seems to say that fascism is good, but I am sure Fincher's intent was the opposite.  The ending was also contrived and not convincing. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton both perform well in the film.  Meat Loaf also has a good supporting role.  It is not enough however for me to recommend this film.",0
"I totally agree with all critics and comments here that laud the film for being exciting, both in terms of acting and cinematography. I also have no problems with the excessive violence. But I have a lot of issues with it's content: that women are portrayed as non-existent (save, of course, for what amounts to an emotional whore); that ""men"" alone are supposedly oppressed and confined by our society, as though they alone miss the action and challenge of the past; that social change here equals destruction, and not construction. Things can be dismantled and improved without violence and destruction, and this film leaves no room for that fact of life. I was also totally baffled by the comment about their being men ""who are babies, children, a generation raised by women."" Which generation WASN'T raised by women? And what does that have to do with their rage? Why wouldn't that make them, and not their sisters or fathers, angry too? I'd appreciate input on that. In addition, I think a lot of people who see this movie are not mature/intelligent enough to realize that for all the violence, that's not the only point of the movie, that there is more to it both cinematically and philosophically than beating people up. And it scares me that those people will take the wrong impression with them. NOT that this movie, or other violent movies shouldn't be released--it's just a shame that ignorant people will read them incorrectly...",0
"I'm not gonna talk about the plot and story of the movie, the first rule of the Fight Club being not to talk about it... One thing I have to point out: I accepted the over exaggerated amount of violence spread around the entire movie, but what was it all for? David Fincher manages to deliver an excellent movie for two thirds of its lenght, then, (don't ask my why) things goes horribly wrong and the director simply seems unable to step out of all this mess, serving up an unsatisfactory (happy?) end that leaves the viewer dubious about the entire movie.Has it got any sense? Maybe, but frankly is an obscure one, and anyway not as smart as its characters try to tell us. It's really a pity, because visually the movie is simply superb, the audio department is heavenly and the two male leads give wonderful performances, particularly Brad Pitt in what is maybe his best work to date.In the end, a very strange movie, with a very strange message, that will surely find disciples and adepts among the less discerning members of the audience, but that nevertheless should be seen as a potentially dangerous object from which could eventually be better keep the distance.",0
"This film has been claimed to be, by members of this site and others, to be one of the greatest movies of all time. I still can't get over how people could possibly think that. Did the movie suck? Definitely not   Was it a decent flick? Yes.The cinemetography , editing, and Fincher's directing were very good. The acting was superb. Brad Pitt delivered an excellent performance as Tyler Durden. And I still believe that Edward Norton is the best young actor today. The first 30-60 minutes were good. When Fight Club gets going and the whole Project Mayhem thing starts, it was a little ridiculous and my interest started to fade. Yes, the violence was entertaining to me,  I AM still 18, but it was definitely a little much. The message that ""you don't know who you are until you get into a fight"" is just silly. And that Edward Norton can only realize that life can contain positive things through this club is pretty sketchy. It's not until the infamous ending that the film TOTALLY falls off in my opinion. The double personality thing turned me off from the movie. It made the rest of the movie seem worthless as opposed to the intended improved.This to me was just your average psychological thriller that fails in it's attempt to kick you in the teeth with ""whoa! that was amazing"" and ends up slapping you in the face with ""wow! nice try, but that is just plain ridiculous""",0
"First of all, in terms of story, the plot switch in the middle of the movie wasn't done that gracefully, and I'm a person who likes plot switches. The ""fight for a better tomorrow"" aspect was amusing and original, but not profound. I didn't think the acting was all that great overall, but you always have to appreciate Brad Pitt's energy. I think the final worth of a movie is how it pleases, and how it affects the viewers. So without being a spoiler, let me say I was disappointed. I didn't find the characters appealing, and a lot of the action seemed mostly revolting (and I'm a fight fan).",0
"I initially saw this film when it had it's cinematic release, but my viewing was soured by a noisy audience. So I returned to watch it on satellite last night, and i have to say I do stand by my initial judgment.The first half of this film is one of the best films in the past 10 years. It's fresh, cool and perfectly captures the male angst as we enter a new millennium. The second half is more messy in comparison, and so this film has to go down as an honourable attempt.Fincher has showed excellent promise and originality with his first few films. Norton is a good actor, and Pitt can be excellent when he wants to be.",0
"When i first saw this film at the cinema, i was blown away with how thought provoking it was. I went to see this movie just expecting a dumb brained film about bare knuckle fighting, but was amazed how much more it was. I then watched it again and again. But the more i watch this the worst it gets. It really is just a macho movie, which quotes great lines from the book. Do yourself a favour and read the book instead, which is great, and then just watch any Rocky movie (its more fun) instead.",0
"Quite simply this was a BAD,BORING and very overrated movie. The story was terrible,the premise was absurd and the acting was terrible. The movie went 45 minutes too long and the characters were so unbelievable it was hilarious. The twist at the end was awesome but by that point you just don't care. * out of *****",0
